II. BackgroundThe second FAA-sponsored Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) Workshop [2] defined SAA as "the capability of a UAS to remain well clear from, and avoid collisions with, other airborne traffic."The self separation function is intended to be a means of compliance with the regulatory requirements (14 CFR Part 91, §91.111 and §91.113) to "see and avoid" and remain "well clear" of other aircraft.The UAS community has transitioned to using the term "detect and avoid" (DAA) rather than "sense and avoid" with no change in meaning.The rest of this paper uses DAA for consistency.As part of the RTCA SC-228 effort to develop MOPS for DAA systems, this study analyzes both LoWC and encounters in simulation.The definitions of LoWC and encounter as well as related background information on these separation standards are provided next.
A. Loss of DAA Well ClearThe SAA workshop [2] defined "well clear" as the state of maintaining a safe distance from other aircraft that would not normally cause the initiation of a collision avoidance maneuver by the UAS or any other aircraft.A set of well clear definitions was proposed by a recent FAA report [2], a dedicated U.S. government workshop on well clear [3], and variations on methods utilized by TCAS II [5], [12].The LoWC definition uses a spatial separation threshold in the vertical dimension known as * h d to which the current vertical separation between the two aircraft is compared:2 1 h d h h = -(1)The LoWC definition also utilizes a spatial separation metric in the horizontal dimension known as horizontal miss distance ( HMD ), which is the projected separation in the horizontal dimension at the predicted closest point of approach (CPA) using linear extrapolation in the horizontal dimension:  In the example illustrated in Fig. 1, the HMD is the cross-track distance between the UAS and the manned aircraft because the former is flying due east while the latter is flying due west.ì + + + ³ ï = í ¥ < ï î = - = -The LoWC definition also uses a temporal separation metric known as "modified tau" or mod t that estimates the time to CPA between two aircraft.Modified tau is adopted from the collision detection logic of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) [5] that is on board manned aircraft.Modified tau is based on the concept of "tau" ( t ), which is calculated as the ratio of slant range ( r ) between aircraft to their slant range rate ( r ) and measured in seconds:2 2 2 2/ where Note that is negative when aircraft are converging Note that is positive when aircraft are convergingAs described in the TCAS II Manual [5], one issue with the tau metric is that the calculated tau can be large even when the physical separation between two aircraft is small if the rate of closure is low (e.g., two flights flying at approximately the same speed, on the same heading, and offset by a small distance).In such a situation, the calculated tau value does not assure adequate separation because a sudden trajectory change that increases the closure rate (e.g., a turn) may cause LoWC.To provide protection for these types of situations, a modified alerting threshold referred to as "modified tau" was developed for use in TCAS II.Modified tau utilizes a parameter known as "distance modification" ( DMOD ) to provide a minimum threat range boundary encircling the ownship aircraft that triggers an alert regardless of the calculated value of tau.In
B. EncounterAn encounter in this study is notionally determined by when and where a DAA system becomes responsible for mitigating a potential threat.Since manufacturers may have differing operational requirements, encounters may be defined in a different way for each DAA system.The RTCA SC-228 safety sub-group came to a consensus to utilize a definition of encounter that is comprised of both temporal and spatial parameters like the definition of well clear while using threshold values that were prior to or outside of the generic volume in which the DAA system becomes responsible for mitigating potential threats.Encounters are events in which UAS are in proximity with another aircraft such that the following two conditions are true: Note that there will be more encounters than LoWC because the definition of encounter has higher thresholds and does not have an HMD condition compared to the definition of LoWC.
C. Summary of LoWC and Encounter DefinitionsTable 1 summarizes the metrics used in the definitions of LoWC and encounter.
III. MethodologyThis section describes the two analyses performed to estimate the frequency of encounters and LoWC between In order to perform these analyses, a series of three different algorithms were applied to historical FAA and air defense radar measurements to pre-process and synthesize them into tracks (Section III.A): 1) minimum-spanning tree clustering [7], 2) Kalman filter-based track association with constant velocity propagation model, and 3) stitching.A fast-time simulation platform [13] known as the Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES) was then used to play back the processed VFR tracks while also simulating UAS flights (about 26,500 per day).Each simulated UAS flew one of 18 missions (Section III.B), which were developed by reviewing the literature, interviewing stakeholders and subject-matter experts, and performing socio-economic analysis [6].The simulated UAS tracks and the VFR playback tracks were then compared to identify instances when encounter and LoWC occurred.This NAS-wide approach to studying interactions between UAS and VFR aircraft is complementary to the pairwise approach of other research efforts that utilized MIT-Lincoln Laboratory's uncorrelated encounter model [14] and correlated encounter model [15].In the simulations with ATC-like mitigations, manned IFR flights were also simulated based on actual flight schedule and flight plan data (Section III.C).An ATC-like conflict detection and resolution algorithm [10] separated simulated UAS flights from simulated manned IFR flights (Section III.D).The algorithm utilizes heuristics derived from ATC feedback during human-in-the-loop simulations [11].Table 3 summarizes the preceding description of the simulations that were run for this paper.The remainder of Section III contains additional details on each simulation component in Table 3 as well as the database of airspace boundaries that was utilized to investigate where encounters and LoWC occurred (Section III.E).
Table 3 Summary of simulation components
Simulation
Minimum-Spanning Tree Clustering AlgorithmTo create tracks for cooperative VFR flights, NASA researchers developed a minimum-spanning tree clustering algorithm [7] for the radar measurements with a Mode 3/A transponder code of 1200.The clustering portion of this algorithm consists of two parts: 1) grouping together radar data that lie within time windows of two minutes in duration, and 2) comparing clusters across consecutive time windows.First, the algorithm gathered all radar measurements in the first two-minute time window of the data set and divided them into groups such that the sum of the distances between radar positions within each group and the distances between groups was minimized.The time window was then moved forward 10 seconds and the process was repeated for the rest of the data set.Second, the algorithm grouped the clusters in consecutive two-minute time windows such that the number of overlapping radar positions in each group of clusters was maximized.Lastly, a Kalman filter was used to smooth each group of radar data into trajectories.
Kalman Filter-Based Track Association AlgorithmHoneywell in collaboration with NASA developed a complementary algorithm to process "search only" radar measurements into non-cooperative VFR tracks."Search only" refers to targets reported by primary radar based on electromagnetic wave reflections that were not reinforced with a beacon sensor report.This algorithm was a Kalman filter-based track association algorithm with constant velocity propagation model to identify and generate tracks from multiple returns.Since primary radar returns do not have altitude information, the algorithm assigned a single cruise altitude to each non-cooperative VFR aircraft trajectory (i.e., climbs and descents were not modeled).The algorithm did this by using a gamma distribution fitted to the altitude data (ft MSL) in the 3D Air Route Surveillance Radar-4 (ARSR-4) returns for non-cooperative VFR aircraft (shape, location, and scale parameters were approximately 3.174, -501.043, and 1593.602,respectively).ARSR-4 radars are used around the borders of the CONUS.This approach makes the assumption that the gamma distribution for altitude constructed from the ARSR-4 returns is representative of the altitude distribution across the entire CONUS.
Stitching AlgorithmThe clustering and track association algorithms addressed several issues with the raw radar measurements (Table 4), but closer inspection of the VFR trajectories produced by these algorithms found unrealistically short flights caused by dropouts and missing returns in the raw radar measurements.Thus, NASA developed a stitching algorithm that: 1) grouped unrealistically short flight trajectories with other trajectories that were sufficiently close in both time and distance such that a VFR aircraft could realistically fly between them, and 2) merged them using linearly interpolation between the end of one flight trajectory and the start of the other.Table 4 summarizes the algorithms discussed with regard to their purpose, issues addressed, and issues outstanding.On average, about 24,300 flight hours of VFR tracks were played back per simulation day in this study.
B. UAS MissionsThe FAA's UAS Integration Concept of Operations (FAA CONOPS) [9] requires UAS to operate under IFR and allows UAS to operate in airspace with manned aircraft.One key challenge for UAS integration into the NAS is that UAS operate and fly differently than most manned IFR aircraft.For instance, while manned IFR aircraft typically fly from origin to destination along fixed airways and jet routes, UAS are expected to fly mission-oriented flight plans that can include many turns and altitude changes within an area.Modeling of projected UAS operations is crucial for accurately estimating the safety provided by DAA systems for UAS operations in the NAS.Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) in collaboration with NASA developed the set of 18 UAS mission types used in this study [6] that includes nine new UAS missions in addition to the preliminary set of nine UAS missions created for a prior study on DAA alerting and LoWC [4].These 18 UAS mission types (Table 5) were developed based on literature review and socio-economic analysis as well as interviews with stakeholders and subject-matter experts regarding:• Flight profile (e.g., route, altitude, takeoff time, duration),• Payload (sensors, equipment),• Operational logistics (e.g., number of flights per day, time of day), and As indicated in [4], the characteristics of these missions are consistent with the missions outlined in the FAA CONOPS [9], RTCA DO-320 [16], and a recent Volpe Technical Report [17].On average, about 26,500 UAS flights were modeled flying a total of about 55,000 hours per simulation day in this study.This is the level of UAS demand projected by socio-economic analysis for 25 years in the future.This projection is based on factors such as gross domestic product and population demographics [6].The UAS aircraft performance models utilized in the current study were generated from industry data [18] and validated by IAI [6].message.The last filed flight plan before takeoff for an aircraft was assumed to contain the desired route.On average, about 26,500 UAS flights were modeled flying a total of about 55,000 hours per simulation day in this study.• Aircraft type
D. ATC-like Mitigation Model: AutoresolverSimulated ATC mitigations in this study were provided by a conflict prediction and resolution algorithm known as Autoresolver [10] that utilizes heuristics derived from ATC feedback during human-in-the-loop simulations [11].Autoresolver issued maneuvers to resolve two types of separation assurance conflicts at the current en route separation standard of 5 nmi horizontally and 1000 ft vertically: 1) predicted conflicts between manned IFR aircraft and UAS aircraft, and 2) predicted conflicts between two manned IFR aircraft.In this study, Autoresolver was configured such that conflict resolution maneuvers also maintained separation of at least 5 nmi horizontally or 1000 ft vertically with all other IFR flights-both manned and unmanned-as well as separation of at least 1.5 nmi horizontally or 500 ft vertically with all other VFR flights to avoid creating new conflicts, encounters, or LoWC.This was assumed to model how air traffic controllers maintain sufficient separation between all aircraft at all times.Encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft still occurred in the simulations with ATC-like mitigations because VFR aircraft change their flight paths horizontally and vertically unpredictably on a regular basis.
E. Airspace Class DatabaseThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) was utilized to categorize encounters and LoWC by airspace class.It contains airspace boundaries defined in terms of latitudes, longitudes, and altitudes for Class B (upside-down wedding cake between the surface and 10,000 ft MSL around the busiest airports), Class C (upside-down wedding cake between the surface and 4000 ft MSL around medium-traffic airports), and Class D (cylinder between the surface and 2,500 ft MSL at smaller airports that have an operational control tower).Most altitude boundaries in the DAFIF are defined in terms of MSL, but some are defined in terms of AGL.All
IV. ResultsThe first part of this section compares the frequency and geometry of encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft in two sets of simulations, one with ATC-like mitigations and the other without ATC-like mitigations.The purpose of this analysis is to assess the extent to which ATC-like mitigations for separation conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft affect encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft.Since the results of this analysis found that ATC-like mitigations do not have a substantial impact, the second part of this section focuses on the results of the simulations without ATC-like mitigations in greater detail with regard to: 1) airspaces that could serve as useful environments for conducting research on the selection of parameters for DAA systems, and 2) minimum surveillance ranges needed for UAS on-board sensors to detect encounters and LoWC.
A. FiltersEncounters and LoWC were filtered out of the analysis if the UAS or the VFR aircraft met at least one of the following conditions: 1) position was in class A airspace, 2) time in the ACES simulation was less than two minutes (i.e., pop-up), 3) altitude was less than 10,000 ft and airspeed was greater than 250 kts.About half of the encounters and LoWC were filtered out of the analysis.Of these, more than 90% were filtered out because they were in class A airspace (filter 1) or they were pop-up events (filter 2) or both.On average, there were about 4900 encounters and 450 LoWC per simulation day in this study.
B. Analysis 1: Effect of ATC-like Mitigations on Encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR Aircraft
Differences in Rates of Encounter and LoWCFig. 3a is a plot of the rate of encounters between UAS and VFR aircraft in the simulations without ATC-like mitigations provided by Autoresolver (blue bars) and the simulations with ATC-like mitigations (cyan bars).Fig. 3b is the corresponding plot for LoWC.The rates of encounter and LoWC were calculated by dividing the number of encounter and LoWC boundary crossings, respectively, by the total UAS flight time.Note that the scales of the two charts differ by one order of magnitude.The two plots illustrate that the maneuvers issued by Autoresolver to resolve conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft did not affect the rates of encounter or the rates of LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft.This result was observed consistently across all four simulation days.As seen in the rightmost set of bars in Fig. 3a, the overall rate of encounters in the simulations with ATC-like mitigations was only 0.2% lower than in the simulations without ATC-like mitigations; both were about 0. The rates of encounter and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft in the simulations with ATC-like mitigations and the simulations without ATC-like mitigations were essentially the same even though an average of 3100 conflict resolution maneuvers were issued per day of the ATC-mitigated simulations for conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft-61% of which were sent to UAS (Fig. 4a).Overall, Autoresolver issued one resolution to a UAS every 13.4 UAS flight hours (Fig. 4b) for predicted conflicts with manned IFR aircraft.In summary, the analyses in this section demonstrate that ATC-like resolutions issued to UAS for conflicts with manned IFR aircraft had essentially no effect on the rates of encounter and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft.
Differences in Geometric Characteristics of Encounters and LoWCThe prior analysis demonstrates that ATC-like mitigations provided by Autoresolver for conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft did not affect the rate of encounters or the rate of LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft.This section explores the extent to which ATC-like mitigations affected the geometric characteristics of those encounters and LoWC.In total, nineteen geometric characteristics at the time of encounter and LoWC were analyzed: seven absolute geometric characteristics each for the UAS and VFR aircraft and five relative geometric characteristics (Tables 6 and7).The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS2) test was used to identify which geometric characteristics (if any)were affected by ATC-like mitigations.The KS2 test is a nonparametric hypothesis test that estimates the probability that two data sets come from the same underlying distribution.A small p-value (e.g., less than or equal to 0.05) would indicate that ATC-like mitigations have a statistically significant effect on the geometric characteristic analyzed.These cases require additional investigation to determine whether or not there were any practical differences.Table 6 contains the p-values of the KS2 test for the nineteen geometric characteristics evaluated at the time of encounter.Eighteen of them were not statistically different at the 10% level or less for any of the four simulation days.Only modified tau was statistically different at the 5% significance level for one simulation day (October 6)and at the 10% significance level for two other simulation days (January 11 and April 21).To investigate the extent to which this statistical difference was practically different, modified tau is plotted in Fig. 6 for the encounters between UAS and VFR aircraft in the October 6 simulation without ATC-like mitigations (blue bars) and in the October 6 simulation with ATC-like mitigations (cyan bars).On this chart, the leftmost group of bars is the percent of encounters between UAS and VFR in which modified tau ranged from 0 sec up to but not including 10 sec, for example.Fig. 6 illustrates that there were no practical differences between the modified tau distributions in the October 6simulations.The combination of this result and the KS2 test results indicate that ATC-like mitigations for separation conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft did not significantly affect the geometric characteristics of encounters between UAS and VFR aircraft in the simulations conducted in this study.Table 7 contains the p-values of the KS2 test applied to the same set of nineteen geometric characteristics at the initial time of LoWC.None of them were even close to being statistically different, which indicates that ATC-like mitigations for separation conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft did not significantly affect the geometric characteristics of LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft in the simulations conducted in this study.In summary, the results presented in this section demonstrate that Autoresolver resolutions issued to UAS for conflicts with manned IFR aircraft had almost no effect on the geometry characteristics of encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft.Thus, the rest of this paper will focus on analyzing encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft in the simulations without ATC-like mitigations for conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft.Larger surveillance ranges than these minimums are needed to account for the time required for the DAA tracking, alerting, and guidance processes as well as coordination with ATC and uncertainty (e.g., unexpected maneuvers by VFR aircraft).Fig. 14a and Fig. 14b are plots of the range (nmi) and bearing (15-degree bins) between UAS (ownship shown flying due east) and VFR aircraft at the initial time of encounter and LoWC, respectively.They illustrate the contours within which 99% (blue), 90% (cyan), 80% (maroon), and 60% (magenta) of the data were located.For instance, the blue contour in Fig. 14a shows the distances needed to detect 99% of encounters between UAS and VFR aircraft that were located in front (0°), in back (180°), on the right (90°), and on the left (270°) of the UAS.As expected, the shapes of the contours indicate that UAS entered into both encounter and LoWC at much further ranges with VFR aircraft that were located in front of the UAS as indicated by the portion of the contours around 0° (e.g., due to head-on cases) compared to VFR aircraft that were located on the sides or behind the UAS.

V. ConclusionRTCA SC-228 is developing minimum operational standards for DAA systems that will enable UAS to fulfill the see-and-avoid requirement to preserve well clear separation from other aircraft-both manned and unmanned.As part of that effort, this study measured the rates of encounter and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft in NASwide simulations for four days in 2012.Running additional days of simulation in follow-up work would improve the statistical accuracy of these rate estimates and expand the set of safety-critical interactions that would be available for follow-up studies to inform the alerting, guidance, surveillance, and other aspects of the MOPS for UAS DAA systems.Besides the rates of encounter and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft that were estimated, one of the main takeaway results from this study is that ATC-like mitigations for conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft did not substantially affect the rates of encounter and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft or the geometric characteristics of these safety-critical events.Although the Autoresolver algorithm that provided ATC-like mitigations in this study utilized heuristics derived from ATC feedback in human-in-the-loop simulation, it is important to verify the results of this study with other separation assurance conflict resolution algorithms in followup work.Furthermore, even though ATC-like mitigations for conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft did not substantially affect the interactions between UAS and VFR aircraft, it does not necessarily ensure that the conflict resolutions issued by ATC will be compatible with the guidance provided by UAS DAA systems.As such, it is also important to conduct follow-up research to develop methods that ensure interoperability between separation assurance conflict resolutions sent by ATC, guidance provided by DAA systems on board UAS, and resolution advisories issued by TCAS systems on board manned and unmanned aircraft.HE RTCA Special Committee-228 (SC-228) is a consortium of government, industry, and academic institutions charged with developing Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that satisfy federal aviation regulations to remain well clear of other aircraft (14 CFR Part 91, §91.111 and §91.113
aircraft and a set without ATC-like mitigations are then compared to analyze the downstream effects of ATC-like mitigations on the frequency and geometric characteristics of encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft.Since the results indicate that ATC-like mitigations for separation conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft do not substantially affect encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft (Section IV.B), the remainder of the paper focuses on the simulations without ATC-like mitigations (Section IV.C).First, the locations of encounters and LoWC are analyzed to identify airspaces that are useful environments for conducting research on the selection of parameters for DAA systems.Then, the range and bearing of encounters and LoWC are analyzed to inform the RTCA SC-228 DAA MOPS on the minimum surveillance ranges needed for UAS on-board sensors to detect all encounters and LoWC.Lastly, the results of the research are summarized and their implications for future work are discussed (Section V).

UAS and VFR aircraft in NAS-wide simulations and analyze their geometric characteristics for the RTCA SC-228 DAA MOPS.The scope of this study on the interactions between simulated UAS tracks and recorded radar tracks for VFR aircraft operating lower than 18,000 ft mean sea level (MSL) (i.e., under Class A airspace), higher than 500 ft above ground level (AGL) to avoid radar return clutter, and within the continental United States (CONUS) is within the scope of the RTCA SC-228 DAA MOPS.Analysis 1 compares the encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft in two sets of NAS-wide fasttime simulations, one set with modeled ATC-like mitigations for separation conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft and one set without modeled ATC-like mitigations.Since Analysis 1 shows that ATC-like mitigations for separation conflicts between UAS and manned IFR aircraft do not substantially affect encounters and LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft, Analysis 2 focuses on the simulations without ATC-like mitigations to: 1) identify airspace regions that would be useful for conducting research on selecting parameters for DAA systems, and 2) inform the RTCA SC-228 DAA MOPS of the surveillance ranges needed to detect all encounters and LoWC.
Playback: 84 th Radar Evaluation Squadron (RADES) Air Defense Radar DataThe 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron (RADES) at Hill Air Force Base, Utah provided historical FAA and air defense radar measurements.They collect data through the Eastern and Western Defense sectors and provide it to a variety of government entities.They maintain continuous real-time feeds from short-range radars in the interior of the CONUS and long-range air route surveillance radars that cover the perimeter.Four days of traffic data from four different months in 2012 were processed into tracks for use in the simulations conducted for this study: January 11, April 21, July 17, and October 6, 2012.These days were chosen because they did not have adverse meteorological conditions that might impact VFR traffic densities.A series of algorithms was developed by NASA and its partners to mitigate many of the challenging characteristics in the raw radar data, such as: 1) inconsistent or absent Mode 3/A transponder identification, 2) multiple position reports for the same aircraft from different radar locations, 3) position reports without altitude measurements, 4) asynchronous position reports, and 5) missing position reports.The unique flight characteristics and data availability for cooperative VFR flights (Mode 3/A transponder code of 1200) and non-cooperative VFR flights (no Mode 3/A transponder code) necessitated the development of separate algorithms to process their raw radar measurements into 4-D tracks.(Flights with a Mode 3/A transponder code other than 1200 are treated as IFR flights; these tracks were not played back because IFR flights were modeled in the simulations with ATC-like mitigations based on flight plan information extracted from various NAS messages in ASDI data as described in Section III.C.)
Fig. 2 Fig. 222Fig.2illustrates a sample of the UAS missions simulated in this paper.For instance, the radiator-grid patterns in the western portion of the CONUS are strategic wildfire missions, each of which are 20 hours in duration and modeled as a General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper.In addition, many of the point-to-point trajectories in the eastern portion of the CONUS are remotely piloted air taxi missions that are between 20 and 45 minutes in duration and modeled as Cessna 510 Citation Mustang or Cirrus SR22 aircraft.(See[6] for additional details.)
AGL altitude boundaries were converted to MSL using the U.S. Geological Survey's National Elevation Data [19]-[20].Encounters and LoWC not within a Class B, C, or D airspace boundary as defined in the DAFIF were categorized as occurring in Class A airspace if the altitude of the UAS was between altitude 18,000 ft and 60,000 ft MSL.Lastly, the rest of the encounters and LoWC were grouped into a "Class E/G" category due to the lack of airspace boundary data for Class E (all controlled airspace not Class A, B, C, or D) and G (uncontrolled airspace) in the DAFIF database.

Fig. 7a isFig. 7 a7Fig.7ais a plot of the rates of encounter between UAS and VFR aircraft in the four simulation days without ATC-like mitigations.Overall, there were about 0.17 encounters between UAS and cooperative VFR aircraft per UAS flight hour, which equates to about one encounter every 5.9 UAS flight hours.In addition, encounters between UAS and non-cooperative VFR aircraft occurred at a rate of about one every 49.7 UAS flight hours.Overall, UAS encountered VFR aircraft about once every 5.3 UAS flight hours.As illustrated in Fig.7b, the overall rate of LoWC between UAS and VFR aircraft was about one order of magnitude lower at one every 57.3 UAS flight hours.
Fig. 8a andFig. 8 a8Fig.8aand Fig.8billustrate the rates of encounter and LoWC, respectively, between UAS and VFR aircraft by altitude bands of 1000 ft (e.g., the leftmost bar of Fig.8ais the encounter rate in the altitude band from 0 ft up to but not including 1000 ft).Encounter and LoWC rates were both highest at altitudes below 5000 ft.This result indicates that altitudes below 5000 ft are a useful environment for conducting research on the selection of parameters for DAA systems.This result was driven by where VFR flights currently operate as recorded in the RADES radar data (Section III.A) and where UAS missions are projected to be (Section III.B).

The first filter was applied to be consistent with the scope of the RTCA SC-228 DAA MOPS.Typically, UAS will not use DAA systems while in Class A airspace since ATC will separate UAS from all IFR traffic.The second filter was utilized because pre-departure scheduling by ATC would have prevented these situations by ensuring sufficient separation with other aircraft.The third filter was employed because Federal Aviation Regulations do not permit flights below altitude 10,000 ft to fly faster than 250 kts [14 CFR, Part 91, §91.117(a)].
