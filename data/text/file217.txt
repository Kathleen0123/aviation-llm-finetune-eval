2.OVERVIEW OF TRAFFIC-MA_IAGEMENT SYSTEM Fig.I shows the major elements of the terminal-area-traffic-management system that is being studied at Ames Research Center.The two major ground-based elements of this system are primarily embodied in two computer algorithms referred to as the scheduler and the 4D profile descent aOvisor.The airborne elements are aircraft equipped with 4D flight-management systems and unequipped aircraft.The scheduler generates the landing order and the conflict-free landing times for all aircraft, both 4D-equipped and unequipped.Primary input to the scheduler is the list of arrival_nd their estimated arrival times at the entry point into the extended terminal area.Entry points, also known as feeder fixes, generally are located near the end of cruise flight just prior to the descent point, which is about 120 n.mi.from the destination runway for conventional jet-transport aircraft.The most important factors considered by the scheduler in generating efficient landing times are the minimum separation times between aircraft and the landing-order criterion, as exemplified by the first-come-first-served rule.The minimum time separations between aircraft are derived from the mlnimum-distance separation rules specified by the FAA and given in Table I.These separation rules depend on aircraft weight class (small, large, and heavy) and the landing sequence.By combining the data in Table i with the known speed profiles of each aircraft weight class along the common flnal-approach path, the matrix of minimum time separation (Table 1) can be calculated.If two consecutive aircraft are 4D-equipped, the interarrival times given in Table I are used directly for scheduling purposes.However, unequipped aircraft, which cannot achieve specified landing times as accurately as 4D-equipped aircraft, are given additional time buffers to prevent separation-distance violations.Further discussion of this subject can be found in Ref. i.The scheduler is designed as a real-time expert system that provides for efficient interaction with a human controller.The controller monitors the time assignments of the scheduler on a graphics terminal and can override its ordering and time-assignment decisions by using a small, but flexible, list of commands.For example, controllers can delay traff _-at the feeder fixes or increase the time separation if delays are being encountered in the terminal area.Also, they can overrule the built-in first-come-first-served rule to give landing time priority to a missed approach or emergency aircraft (Ref.
2).The landing times generated by the scheduler are handled in one of two ways dependin_ on whether the times apply to a 4D-equipped or unequipped aircraft.The times are assumed to be upllnked automatically to equipped aircraft where the on-board 4D flight-management system translates time commands into the appropriate 4D-trajectory commands.The autopilot then flies the aircraft according to these commands, achieving a landing-time accuracy of about _5 sec (Refs.3,4).  1 in order that the benefits of a time-based system be fully realized, This requirement led to the choice of _20 sec as the desired accuracy.
ATC SIMULATIONS OF NIXED TRAFFICThe terminal-area traffic-management concept described in the previous section has been evaluated and its design refined in a series of real- Low-performance (general-aviation) aircraft fly the Oeerpark route from the east, but use the same final approach and land on the same runway as the Jet traffic.The Oeerpark traffic is unequipped and always constitutes 25Z of the traffic mix.In these simulations aircraft entered the extended terminal area at the feeder flx points flying at cruise speed and altitude.The total distance to be flown by hlgh-performance jets was 120 n.mi.and that flown by low-performance aircraft was 60 n.mi.Two air traffic controller positions were established, arrival control and final control.The arrival controller controlled aircraft from all three feeder fixes and transferred traffic to the final controller at approximately 30 n.mi.from touchdown.A typical arrival controller display is shown in Fig. 2. The map portion of the display provides a horizontal display of traffic in the terminal area.Each aircraft position is shown by a triangular symbol.A block of data next to each aircraft (not shown here for simplicity) provides aircraft identification, type, altitude, and speed.The information in the flight data table in the upper-left portion of the display is generated by the scheduler and speed advisory system.At the top of the table, the time is shown in hours, minutes, and seconds.The first column shows the aircraft identification (ID), such as "RI."The second column provides aircraft type (TYPE) which includes 1) weight category (small (S), large (blank), or heavy (H)); and 2) 4D status (equipped (4) or unequipped (U)).The third column provides the assigned route (RT).The fourth column is the scheduled time of arrival (STA) at the runway in minutes and seconds.Thus, RI is scheduled to touch down at 13:37:00.Note that touchdown times are shown for all aircraft, whether they are 4D-equipped or unequipped.For the 4Dequipped aircraft, these times are assigned by the ground-based computer system.For the unequipped aircraft, the time assignments are not given to the pilot directly; rather, the controller uses speed advisories and the known-to-be-on-tlme positions of 4D-equipped aircraft as they traverse their routes to achieve touchdown at the times indicated.The next column is the expected delay (DY) at touchdown in seconds.In an effort to simulate the characteristics of the current en route ATC system, which does not provide accurate time control, the unequipped aircraft were assumed to depart their feeder fixes with an initial time error uniformly distributed in the range +120 sec.This amount is considered rather large even by today's controller experience and certainty will be less with a future en route metering system.Thus, if an aircraft departed the feeder fix gO sec late, a DY of go would be displayed, indicating that unless controller action was taken, the aircraft would touch down 90 sec late.Early arrivals were indicated by a negative value in the DY column, and late arrivals by a positive value.All 4D-equipped aircraft departed the feeder fix at the scheduled departure time.In flight tests, it has been shown that 4D-equipped aircraft can meet time schedules within _+5 sec; hence, these small errors were neglected (Refs.3,7).
IDThe data in the last column give the calibrated airspeeds (CAS) in knots, computed by the speed advisory system.These speed advisories, which are based on current aircraft position, altitude, and wind profile, help the controller to correct the unequipped aircraft's time errors shown in the DY column.The speed advisory is recomputed once per minute using the current aircraft position as long as the delay remains larger than 20 sec.This feature gives the arrival controller the freedom to issue the advisory at a convenient time.The speed advisory incorporated in the ATC simulation is a simplified early version of the more recently developed descent-advisor algorithm, which is detailed in a later section.It will be seen that the new algorithm also provides top-of-descent-point and Mach number advisories in addition to the CAS advisory.However, for investigating controller response and other ATC-related issues the speed advisory system used provides a sufficiently realistic substitute.Finally, aircraft below the dotted line in Fig. 2 are aircraft which will enter the simulated control region at their respective feeder fixes within the next 5 min.The feeder-fix start times are given in minutes and seconds.
Summary of ResultsThe traffic mixes examined in simulation runs, each lasting 1.5 hr, were 0%, 25%, and 50% 4Dequipped aircraft.For each mix, the total arrival rate from the three approach routes was selected to generate a full landing schedule with no excess time gaps between touchdown.This condition required arrival rates that varied from 30 alrcraft/hr for the 0% or baseline mix to 33 aircraft/hr for the 50% mix.The variation is due to the time separation buffers added for the unequipped aircraft.All runs included the _120-sec feeder-flx departure errors for unequipped aircraft.Controllers rated all mixes as having acceptable workload, but considered the 25% mix without speed advisories the most difficult to control.This result was probably related to the controller procedures adopted for this experiment of not disrupting the planned 4D paths of the equipped aircraft unless it was necessary for safety.As a consequence, the final controller occasionally vectored an unequipped aircraft to control its distance spacing from an equipped aircraft when he would have preferred under the circumstances to vector the equipped aircraft.One solution to this problem that will be examined in future simulations is a relaxation of the "do not disrupt" rule.Then, after vectoring an equipped aircraft, the controller would assign a new 4D route and landing time to that aircraft.Some experience with this approach was recently obtained in handling missed approaches of equipped aircraft (Ref.2).Controllers regarded the baseline mix of 0% as reasonable with respect to control difficulty, but not because of lightened workload.Rather it was the most familiar mode of operation.The controllers regarded the 50% mix as easiest to control.Under all mix conditions, controllers found the landing order provided by the flight-data table in Fig. 2 to be helpful and generally accepted the suggested ordering.But they did not make use of the numerical landing-time data.Further insight into the simulation results can be obtained by examiningthe composite plot of aircraft ground tracks generated during a 1.5 hr simulation run.Such a plot is shown in Fig. 3a for As a consequence, the final controller needed to make only minor adjustments in the flightpaths to achteve the desired spacing.FEEDERThe resulting improvement tn the traffic flow manifests itse]f as a reduction In the spread of fllghtpaths along a11 three routes.Furthermore, controllers commented that speed advisories resulted in less bunchlng of traffic and fewer "tles" in the merging area.Traffic seemed to blend together moothly and required fewer vectors, resultlng in reduced complexlty of control.The 50% mix wlth speed advlsorles was rated by controllers as providing the most deslrable control environment of a11 conditions evaluated.The controllers con_nted that it was easy to fit the unequlpped aircraft into their planned tlme slots by vectoring or speed control In the final control sector.One controller stated that he could work and stay on top of the traffic without belng overtaxed.These favorable controller evaluations are reflected in the we11-ordered and narrowly distributed composite-traJectory plots (Fig _W :)obtained for this simulatlon run.In conclusion, the procedures, conN)uter assists, and Informatlon dlsplaj_ used in these simulations establlshed a workable basellne configuration for efflclently contro111ng a mlx of 4O-equlpped and unequipped alrcraft In a tlme-based environn_nt.
DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF 4D-PROFILE-DESCENT ADVISORThe followlng sections present the theory of design and the results of a piloted slmulation of the descent advisor algorithm.The primary topics covered in the discussion of the design include selection of descent procedures, derlvatlon of the aircraft equations of motion, the method of numerical integration, and an example output from the computer Implementatlon of the algorlthm.
Selection of Descent ProfllesThe trajectories generated by the descent-advisor algorithm are based on models of fuel conservative procedures used in airline operations.In such procedures the pilot first selects the point of descent using a simple rule of thumb to estimate the Idle-thrust descent distance.A rule frequently used by pilots assumes 300-ft altitude loss/n.mi.Choosing the point of descent so as to minimize level flight at low altitude is probably the pilot's most important decision for optimizing fuel efficiency.At the point of descent, the pilot reduces thrust approximately to Idle and at the same time commands a pitch-down attitude so as to hold Mach number fixed at the cruise value.Thrust may be kept slightly above the Idle position if there is a requirement not to exceed a descent-rate limit, typically 3000 ft/min.During this constant Mach descent, CAS will increase steadily.When CAS has climbed to a desired value the pilot ceases holding the Mach number and begins tracking the desired CAS through appropriate adjustments to the pitch attitude.As the aircraft approaches an altitude of 10,000 ft, the pilot reduces the descent rate briefly to decelerate to 250 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) as required by ATC regulation.If the initial descent point had been selected properly, the aircraft will be 30 n.mi.from touchdown at the end of the deceleration and the pilot will resume the descent into the terminal area.The primary function of the descent-advisor algorithm is to select the speed profile that achieves the arrival time specified by the scheduler.A secondary function of the advisor is to provide an accurate estimate of the point of descent to optimize fuel efficiency.Later it will be seen that the algorithm accomplishes both functions in a unified computational procedure.The algorithm selects the speed profile with the help of a parameter, o , which determines a Mach number and CAS that falls within the speed envelope of the aircraft as follows:M-Mmln + a(MmaX-Mmln) ; 0 < o < I (1) Vc_ " Vmln + o(Vm_ -Vmin) {2)The family of speed profiles generated by Eqs.(1) and ( 2  For reasons of brevity, the speed-profile selection process just described has been considerably simplified compared to the method actually implemented in the computer algorithm.The computer algorithm includes a more complicated mapping of o into profiles that provides an appropriate transition from the cruise Mach number to the descent Mach number.It also eliminates constant Mach segments in the speed profile If the descent CAS Is less than the cruise CAS.
Equations of MotionNumerical integration of a simplified set of point-mass equations of motion has been adopted as the basic method for calculating the descent trajectory and arrival time corresponding to a given speed profile.This method is computationally intensive, but it is more flexible and more accurate than schemes that depend on analytical approximations or precomputatlons of trajectories.Here, no restrictive assumptions on pilot procedures, wind profiles, or aircraft performance models need be made in calculating trajectories.Potentially, it would even be possible to include the preferred procedures of individual airlines in the calculations of the descent trajectories.To begin with, it is assumed that the aircraft is flying along a known horizontal path in space.Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the vertical profile along the known horizontal path.Furthermore, the horizontal path is assumed to be a straight line, though it is easily modified to include curved segments.Using an Earth-fixed coordinate system with x as the horizontal axis pointing in the flight direction and h as the upward-pointing vertical axis, the components of inertial velocity u and w that must be integrated are dx d_-u -V T cos Ya + Uw ---FI(3)dh d_ _ w = V T sin Ya _ F2 (4)where VT is the true airspeed, Y, the aerodynamic flightpath angle and uw the horizontal component of wind.The airspeed acceleration is calculated from the following equations:duw dVT _ g sin Ya _ (5) dt m dx a mVT d-t-" L -mg cos Ya " 0(6)where T Is thrust, D is drag, L is lift, m is aircraft mass, and is acceleration of gravity.The approximation in Eq. ( 6) implies that accelerations normal t_ the flightpath are considered to have negligible effect on trajectory modeling for this application.This assumption is valid for the low-g maneuvers encountered In commercial transport operations.The value of llft computed by solving the algebraic Eq. (6) couples into Eq.( 5) through the dependence of drag on lift.The last term in Eq. ( 5) reflects the influence of a time-dependent wind, also known as wind shear, on the airspeed acceleration.On the time and distance scale of a descent trajectory It is reasonable to assume that wind shear is only encountered during changes in altltude, implying the relationship Uw(h ).The drag coefficient involved in calculating the drag force was represented by seven fourth-order polynomial functions, each representing a different Mach number in small Increments from Mach 0.6 to 0.9.Both tables and polynomial functions were used to model the thrust and the fuel flow as a function of engine-pressure ratio (EPR), Mach number, temperature, and pressure.Idle thrust and fuel flow were stored in separate tables indexed by Mach number and altitude.Such aircraft performance models must be developed for all major aircraft types that operate into the terminal area where the descent advisor is used to provide tlme control.Another important quantity that the descent advisor uses in computing trajectories is aircraft mass.An adequate estimate of mass can be calculated from a knowledge of aircraft type, point of origin, and takeoff mass.Such information is generally contained in aircraft flight plans or can be obtained from the pilot at take-off time.
4.3Constant Mach/Constant CAS SegmentsIn modeling the speed profile it was shown that pilots maintain either a constant Mach number or a constant CAS during the majority of an aircraft's descent into the terminal area.This assumption can beused to reduce the dlfferentlal equation for alrspeed, Eq. ( 5), to an algebralc relation.Consequently, only the position rates, Eq. ( 3) and ( 4), need to be numerically integrated In such segments.Considering first the constant Mach segment, one can write from the deflnltlon of Mach number VT -a(h)N where a is the speed of sound, which is a function of altitude.respect to time and using the fact that N ts constant, yieldsOifferentlatlng thi_ equation with dVT da dh da d'-'t--" H'a"h " '_"" M,_-_ TaVT (8)where use was made of Eq. (4) and sin Ya _ _.After replacing the left side of Eq. ( 5) with the right side of Eq. (8) and calculating the wind shear term In Eq. (8) as duw/dt " (duw/dh)_Vi, an explicit expression for Ya Is obtained as .(TO)ITaIMc°nstant " "(N _daVT + g + d___vTduW )(9)where the small angle approximation, sin Yi _ Ya has been used.For a constant Mach segment at a known altitude, a11 quantities needed to compute Ya are either known or measurable.The derivative da/dh must be computed by differentiation of the speed of sound function.If thls function is obtained from a table of the standard atmosphere, the derivative can be precomputed numerically, curve-fltted for the range of altitudes of interest, and permanently stored for use by the program.However, the most accurate results w111 be obtained by calculating the speed of sound function from the temperature profile measured at the time and location of the descent.Calculation of the wlnd shear term, du,/dh, depends on knowledge of the altltude-dependent wind proflle in the descent airspace.The descent advisor must compute the derivative numerically and update the derlvatlve whenever the wind profile is updated.Thus, each terminal area where the descent advisor Is used w111 have to provlde for measuring the wind profile at regular intervals during each day.Several technlcaI means exist for measuring the wind proflle including the use of conventional weather balloons.(Ref.8).Considering next the constant CAS segment, an expression for _ can be derived In a similar manner.One begins by writing the expresslon relating true airspeed and CAS VT " VT(VCAs,h)The time derivative of Eq. (10 Y_Ir IS the specific heat of air.Since atmospheric pressure, p, and speed of sound, a, are known functions of altitude, h, the expression for VI In Eq. 12 Is In the form required by Eq. (10).However, the complexity of Eq. (12) makes it Infeaslb]e to compute the derivative of VT wlth respect to h ana]ytlcally for use in Eq. (11).Therefore, the derivative Is computed by a standard numerical technique.)The expression for the flightpath angle in the constant CAS segment can now be obtained by combining Eq. ( 5) and ( 11)PSL s) + -(12)(ovT du,)YeI_S constant VT _ + g + _ VT (13)The last question to be settled in computing Ya is how to determine the thrust, T, In the two expressions for the flightpath angle.In a conventionally equipped aircraft pilots hold thrust more or lessconstant duringdescent bykeeping the throttle leversat their idle position.However, if the idle throttle positionresultsin anexcessive descent rate duringa portionof a descent, thepilot will adjustthe throttles to maintain the descent rate at a specifiedlimit.Sincebothspecifiedthrustandspecified-descent-rate segments canoccur under appropriate conditions, bothhave been implemented andthechoicebetween them is determined bythe constraints of thedescent.If thedescent rate, H, is specified, Ya is computed fromthe relation Ya_ _/VTandEq.(9) and( 13)are solved for the unknown thrust.It should benoted herethat a pilot cannot easilyfly a commanded value of Ya directly because noreadout of this quantityis provided onconventional cockpitinstruments.It is of interestto evaluate theeffect of thewindshear term, (duw/dh).V T onthe descent profile.Forexample, a decreasing tail wind (duw/dh > O)duringdescent resultsin a Ya that is shallower thanthat for a constant wind.Thus,in this case, the descent trajectoryexperiences an expansion of the distance to descend fromcruisealtitude.Theopposite effect occurs for a decreasing head wind.Fora typical windshear of 2 knots/t000 ft, the calculated distance to descend from35,000 ft to sealevel would bein errorby5 n.mi.if this termwereneglected.
Integration AlgorithmAfourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme wasadopted for the numerical integration of the trajectory equations (Ref.10).Thisscheme givesaccurate resultswith relatively largestepsizesandalsodoes notrequireevaluating derivatives of the complex functionsappearing onthe right-hand sidesof the equations beingintegrated.Thelatter property simplifiesthe integration of functions specifiedin tabularform.Forthe constant Mach number andconstant CAS segments, which constitutethemajorityof thedescent, onlyEqs.( 3) and( 4) need to beintegrated, aspreviously explained.LettingAt represent the timeincrement, thenthestates (xi+ I , hl+ I ) at the (i+1)s_ timeincrement are determined fromfour setsof sequentially computed stateincrements asfollows:AlX i = (At)Fl(Xl,hl,ti) (14) Alh i = (At)F2(Xl,hi,ti)(15)(16)A2hi : (At)F2(x i + 1alXi,h i +1 A1hi,t i + 1At) (17) A3xi = (At)Fl(Xi + 1 a2xi,hi + 1A2hi,ti + 1 At) (18) A3hi = (At)F2(x i + 1 A2xi,h i +1 A2hi,t i +½ At) (19) a4X I = (At)Fl(X i + a3xi,h i + a3hi,t i + At) A4hi = (at)F2(x i + A3Xl,h i + a3hl,t i + at) xi+1 = x i + _ (AlXi + 2A2x i + 2A3x i + a4x i) (20) (21) (22) hi+1 = hi + _ (Alhl + 2A2h i + 2A3h i + a4h i) (23)At the top and bottom of the descents rapid changes in speed occur, and neither Mach number nor CAS remain constant.During these acceleration or deceleration intervals it is also necessary to integrate Eq. ( 5) representing rate of change of airspeed.The incremental Eqs. ( 14) through ( 23) were augmented appropriately to integrate this equation.The integration time increment, At, was experimentally selected to be as ]arge as possible to consistently give accurate and numerically stable results.The optimum step sizes were 60 sec for the constant Mach/constant CAS segments and 30 sec for the acce]eration/deceleration segments.
Example Descent ProfileThis section gives an example of a complete descent profile generated by the program.The aircraft model used is that of a 727-200 weighing 140,000 Ib at the start point.Initially the aircraft is cruising at Mach 0.8 and 35,000 ft and is 150 n.mi.from touchdown.The time-control point is located 30 n.mi.from touchdown at lO,O00-ft altitude.At this point the aircraft must have completed its deceleration to 250 knots.A descent time of 985 sec, measured from the 150 n.mi.starting point to the end of the deceleration, is specified.The wind is assumed to be zero throughout the descent.The synthesized trajectory consists of four segments whose parameters are given in Table 2.The first segment is a level-flight segment leading from the starting point to the point of descent at 98 n.mi.from touchdown.The second segment is a Mach 0.8 descent with EPR, which controls thrust, set to near idle (approximately 1).The third segment begins at 27,603 ft where Mach 0.8 corresponds to a CAS of 320 knots.In this constant CAS segment, thrust is held at idle.The fourth segment consists of deceleration from 320 to 250 knots at 10,000 ft.The last line of data in the fourth segment shows that the time and the distance to touchdown closely match the specified values.Various other parameters relating to the trajectory synthesis such as the number of integration steps in each segment and the fuel consumed are also included in the table.In addition to achieving the specified descent time, the synthesized trajectory is also relatively fuel efficient, requiring only 1208 lb for all four segments.Good fuel efficiency is assured by the combined benefits of an idle-thrust descent and the choice of descent point that results in the termination of the trajectory exactly at the specified altitude and distance from touchdown.
Piloted Simulator Evaluation:Experimental SetupAn evaluation of the descent advisor concept was conducted on a so-called phase II simulator of a 727-200 aircraft located in the Man-Vehicle Systems Research Facility at Ames Research Center.This simulator, manufactured by Slnger-L1nk, Is wldely used by airlines for crew training.The slmulator is equipped with a slx-degree-of-freedom motion system and a nlght/dusk vision system.C_uter-generated imagery of the night or dusk scene Is dlsplayed in front of the cockpit windows by four projectors which give a wide, hlgh-resolutlon fie|d of view to the pl|ot and copilot.Each simulated fllght conslsted of a stralght-ln approach beglnnlng I50 n.ml.from the runway threshold at an altitude of 35,000 ft and a speed of Nach 0.8.In all flights a tall wind of 70 knots at 35,000 ft decreaslng llnearlly to zero at the runway was slmulated.Simulated weather conditions conslsted of a vlslblllty ce111ng of IO00 ft above the runway, wlth tops at SO00 ft and llght turbulence at all altitudes.Pilots were briefed on wind and weather conditions prior to the simulation runs.Test subjects were three current 727 pilots, one each from three major U.S. airlines.Initlally, each pilot was asked to fly his own alrllne-recommended descent proflle, which w111 be referred to as the baseline proflle.The three pilots chose essentially the sanm baseline proflle, conslstlng of a Nach-O.8/280-KCASdescent.Each pilot also estimated his top-of-descent polnt uslng the 300 ft/ml rule of thumb mentioned earlier.Range to touchdown was provided by a standard cockpit readout of dlstance measuring equlpment (ONE) range from a statlon located at the destlnatlon airport.All baseline profiles were flown without ATC advisorles.After completlng the basellne descents, the pllots flew three types of controller-asslsted descents referred as nomlnal, slow, and fast wlth speed profiles of Hach 0.8/320 KOAS, 230 KCAS, and Hach 0.85/350 KCAS, respectlvely.Note that the slow and fast profiles follow the limits of the speed envelope for this aircraft (Fig. 4).Before flying these proflles In the slmulator, pilots received brief, written Instructions on operational technlques to be used: i)Thrust Hanagement.-The flight Idle posltlon is to be used in tracking the speed profile unless the descent rate exceeds 3000 ft/mln.If such Is the case, add only sufficient thrust to keep the descent rate from exceeding 3000 ft/min.
2)Deceleratlon at the Top (Slow Proflle).-First,reduce thrust to idle at the descentprocedure start point; second, maintain level flight (zero descent rate) while decelerating to the speclfled CA.S; and third, begin the descent as the speclfled CAS is approached.3) Acceleratlon at the Top (Fast Profile).-At the descent-procedure start point (the top of descent point In this case) initiate a pltch-down maneuver to achieve a 3000-ft/mln descent rate.Then, maintain cruise thrust while accelerating; as the specified Hach number is approached, reduce thrust accordlng to I).
4)Deceleration at the Bottom of Descent (Nominal and Fast Profiles).-As the aircraft approaches iO,O00-ft altitude, decelerate to 250 KCAS in level flight and with thrust still at Idle; resume descent at the 30 n.ml. to the touchdown point.The descent advisories were issued during the slmulatlon by a pseudo-controller located at the englneer's position in the cockpit.The advisories were issued only once approximately a minute before the start point of the procedures and specified the ONE range of the start point and the speed profile.Calculated off-llne by the previously described computer program, the advlsorles typically contained the following information, "Begin descent procedure at I08 ONE; follow a Nach 0.8/320 speed profile using idle thrust."Each type of controller-asslsted descent was flown four to six times.These few simulation runs are believed to provide sufficient information to determine the feasibility of the concept.However, they are too fee in number to warrant extenslve statistical analysis of the results.1), a Ig6-sec error range implies dlfflcultles in achieving efficient traffic flow at termlnal areas mere two or more streams of aircraft flying unaided proflle descents are merged.

ErrorsThus, unaided alrcraft assigned confllct-free tlme slots at the top of descent by an en-route metering system would accumulate unacceptable tlme errors during the descent, and would therefore not be confllct free at the merge point.As a result, the controller would frequently have to interrupt the proflle descents to resolve potentlal confllcts and ensure efficient traffic flow.Such problems have indeed been experienced in As shown in the composite plots in Flg.6, the time variability of the nominal profile descents, flown with the aid of the descent advisories, Is reduced from Ig6 sec for the baseline descents to only 35 sec.Furthermore, the scatter in the altitude profiles is significantly reduced throughout the descent.The predicted trajectory with an arrival time of 893 sec at 30 n.ml. is also plotted in Fig. 6, but is difficult to distinguish from the simulated trajectories because of crowding of the plots.These improvements in accuracy clearly demonstrate the advantage of using the advisories.With the top-of-descent point specified, pilots could concentrate on tracking the speed profile and needed to pay little attention to thrust and altitude management.Without advisories, pilots often cross-check altitude and range and then readjust the thrust so as to minimize anticipated altitude errors at the bottom of the descent.Wlth the advisories, pilots could maintain thrust at idle throughout, and yet be confident that the altitude target at 30 n.mi.would be achieved.As seen in the co_)oslte plots, Figs.7 and8, the time variability and the altitude scatter of the fast and slow profiles are even lower than those of the nominal profile.In fact, the slow profiles have the unusually low variability of only 7 sec, which one would expect to obtain only from a closed-loop 4D guidance s_tem.This high accuracy is probably related to the fact that they are  3 show that the slow profile is the most fuel efficient and the fast profile the least fuel efficient.The nomlnal profile, though considerably faster than the baseline profile, consumes only slightly more fuel (17 Ib) on averge than the baseline does.Thus, the trade off between time and fuel, so important in airline operations, favors choosing the nominal profile.However, the profile actually assigned to an aircraft by the air traffic scheduler will depend on the availability of a confllct-free time slot at the time of descent.In addition to tests of the tail-wind condition reported herein, head-wind and zero-wind conditions have recently also been tested.Preliminary analysis is yielding results that are generally consistent with the tail-wind conditions.Also, the time variability between the 30-n.mi.point and touchdown was investigated for both a stralght-in and a standard-approach pattern, the latter consisting of downwind, base, and final segments.Analysis of results for these conditions is still in progress.Pilots participating in the simulation generally reacted favorably toward the profile-descent advisory concept.The pilots cited as the primary benefit the accurate specification of the top-ofdescent point in the presence of complex altitude-dependent wind profiles.Moreover, the pilots considered the advisories as unobtrusive and all profiles as comfortable to fly.The experience of this study has identified the following three guidelines for achieving accurate time control.First, descent procedures provided by advisories should be simple to execute and familiar to pilots.Second, aircraft performance and atmospheric conditions should be accurately represented in the advisor algorithm.Third, pilots should be briefed on the characteristics of the advisories and the requirement to execute them accurately.The time accuracies achieved in the simulation would be adequate for a time-based ATC system if they could be duplicated in practice.However, uncertainty in the knowledge of the actual wind profile and inevitable lapses in pilot attention to the profile tracking task will result in larger errors than obtained in the simulation.One can attempt to estimate such time errors from analysis of ATC radar tracking data during an aircraft's descent.Then, an updated speed advisory can be issued near the midpoint of the descent to minimize these errors.With the addition of such a midpoint advisory, control of arrival time within_20 sec appears to be feasible.FigFig. I, Terminal-area traffic management system.

Controllers were instructed to monitor the progress of 4D-equipped aircraft after the time assignment had been established, and to override the automated scheduler only if necessary to ensure safe separation. Any 4D-equipped aircraft could also be controlled by conventional methods and treated as unequipped. Alternatively, a 4D- equipped aircraft which had been taken off its 4D route and time schedule could be given a waypoint to recapture a 4D route and be given a revised landing time. Unequipped aircraft were considered to be navigating in the conventional manner via very-high-frequency omnidirectional rangeprocedures,withaltitudeclearances,radarvectors,and speed control.

This paper describes an automated air-traffic-management concept that has the potential for significantly increasing the efficiency of traffic flows in high-density terminal areas.The concept's implementation depends on techniques for controlling the landing time of al__!l aircraft entering the terminal area, both those that are equipped with on-board four-dimensional (4D) guidance systems as well as those aircraft types that are conventionally equipped.The two major ground-based elements of the system are a scheduler which assigns conflict-free landing times a profile descent advisor.Landing times provided by the scheduler are uplinked to equipped aircraft and translated into the appropriate 4D trajectory by the on-board flight-management system.The controller issues descent advisories to unequipped aircraft to help them achieve the assigned landing times.Air traffic control simulations have established that the concept provides an efficient method for controlling various mixes of 4D-equipped and unequipped, as well as low-and high-performance, aircraft.Piloted simulations of profiles flown with the aid of advisories have verified the •ability to meet specified descent times with prescribed accuracy.
