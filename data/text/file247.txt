VERTICAL MOTION SIMULATOR COMPLEXThe Vertical Motion Simulator Complex (VMSC) has been in operation since the mid-1970's and is a one-of-a-kind simulation research and development facility offering unparalleled capabilities for conducting studies and experiments involving some of the most challenging aerospace disciplines.The VMSC consists of the world's largest motion base simulator and 5 interchangeable cabs (I-cabs), which can also be used for fixed base simulation.The I-cabs support simulation of various types of flight vehicles including transports, Space Shuttle, helicopters, fighters, and rotorcraft to name a few.The large-amplitude motion system was designed to aid in the study of helicopter and vertical/short take-off landing (V/STOL) issues specifically relating to research in controls, guidance, displays, automation and handling qualities of existing or proposed aircraft.It is also an excellent tool for investigating issues relevant to nap-of-the-earth flight, and landing and rollout studies.The facility is not only renowned for its large amplitude motion system but also for its efficient production of high fidelity, low cost, and rapid concept to research data producing capability, of simulations for existing and future advanced aerospace vehicles.The VMSC is a stand-alone facility with the ability to rapidly prototype any aspect of a simulation including but not limited to real time host computer interfaces, flight deck graphics systems, out the window image generation systems, cockpit controls, cueing devices and high fidelity motion.The VMSC Motion System is a six-degree of freedom electromechanical/electro hydraulic servo system.It is located in and partially supported by a specially constructed 73 feet wide by 36 feet deep by 120 feet high tower, and the motion system uses virtually the entire interior volume of this tower.In addition to its size another unique feature of this facility is that it can simulate the physical cueing environment of a large range of vehicles.Five cabs representing the cockpits of a variety of vehicles and each with its own instruments, controls, visual display and audio cueing systems can be placed on the
INTERCHANGEABLE CABS (I-cabs)Five Interchangeable Cabs (I-cabs) are maintained and operated by SimLab and provide the capability to simulate the cockpit/crew station for almost any imaginable aerospace vehicle.The I-cabs are built up around essentially identical structures that furnish a basis and framework for installing and mounting the numerous items that make up an aircraft cockpit crew station.The basic design and construction of the I-cabs is illustrated in Figure 2. In order to achieve the desired interchangeability the I-cabs are built to rigid mechanical, hydraulic and electrical interface specifications.The structure of each cab is composed of four substructures: the base structure, the fixed canopy section, the removable canopy and the Image Presentation System (IPS) support structure.The base structure is a large flat weldment fabricated from aluminum channels, tubing and plate.It forms the floor of the cab and serves as the attachment to the motion system.All the other substructures are bolted to it.Detachable front and rear sections facilitate transporting the cab between the off-line development area and the motion system.The under-floor structure is designed to provide three adjacent oil-tight bays to accommodate electrohydraulic control loaders used to simulate the primary aircraft flight controls.The three different locations allow for either a single, centrally located pilot station or a two place, side-by-side arrangement.Wiring harnesses, hydraulic lines, junction boxes, instrument panels and consoles, electrical power outlets as well as other items are mounted directly to the base structure.The fixed canopy section forms the rear wall of the cab providing a sturdy structure for mounting a number of items including cab lighting, sound system speakers, pilot observation cameras, head tracking support equipment and standard aircraft size equipment racks.The removable canopy section forms the front wall, sidewalls and roof of the cab and its primary functions are to enclose the equipment contained inside the cab and provide a sound/light barrier to prevent distractions to the pilot.As its name implies, this section can be easily removed with an overhead crane allowing unrestricted access to the other internal items and substructures.The image presentation system (IPS) varies markedly from cab to cab in Field of View (FOV) capabilities.Each IPS is tailored to a specific class of aircraft such as Helicopter, Space Shuttle, Large Commercial and/or heavy lift military aircraft, Tilt Rotor and Military Fighter.No one compact visual system exists that can provide the cumulative FOV requirements for each of class of listed aircraft, hence the need for five cabs.Lastly, all five cabs have removable access porches and can be retrofitted with a wide range of pilot inceptors, seats, instrument panels, etc., from SimLabs' vast inventory of aircraft simulation equipment.The five I-cabs are not only used for flexibility but also for efficiency.While any one cab is on the VMS motion platform the others are being reconfigured and readied for the next vehicle they will simulate.When an I-cab reconfiguration is complete the cab is stored until the current simulation on the VMS motion platform ends.When the simulation currently running on the VMS motion platform simulation is complete the I-cab used for that simulation is replaced with the readied I-cab in storage.It takes approximately one eight hour shift to change I-cabs on the VMSC motion platform and prepare the motion system for a completely different simulation.The short time it takes to exchange cabs allows almost constant utilization and availability of the VMS motion system.
VIRTUAL LABORATORYVirtual Laboratory (VLAB) is a virtual reality environment providing remote access from the researchers desktop to Ames Research Center simulation laboratories for interactive participation with live experiments.VLAB is capable of simulation model control, controls and display development, virtual prototyping, and data browsing.VLAB allows NASA expertise to benefit government and industry in a hands-on fashion by providing convenient access to national simulation resources enabling industry to improve its design process, yielding aeronautical products with a true competitive edge.Using VLAB, multiple researcher's in different locations participating in the same experiment can monitor and actively participate in a simulation from any location in the US.VLAB enables industry/government partnerships to benefit from US aeronautics by providing easy access to national facilities, shared databases, and more effective and efficient design processes.VLAB reduces delays in distribution of experiment results by making data available in real-time within the lab and elsewhere reducing costs associated with human-in-the-loop simulation experiments.VLAB allows multiple researchers to remotely participate in concurrent experiments and in various phases of the design cycle.The system allows researchers to develop math models, displays, control systems, validate models for higher quality experiments, and provide fully compatible software modules all from their integrated desktop.VLAB has thus far been extensively used for Space Shuttle, Civil Tilt Rotor, NTSB and DOD simulations, research associate presentations, VIP demos, and education purposes.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SIMULATORThe Air Traffic Control (ATC) environment is a significant contributor to pilot workload and therefore to the performance of crews in flight.Full-mission simulation is greatly affected by the realism with which the ATC environment is modeled.From the crew's standpoint, this environment consists of dynamically changing verbal or data-link messages, some addressed to or generated by the crew, others addressed to or generated by other aircraft flying in the immediate vicinity.The ATC simulator is capable of operating in three modes: stand-alone, without participation by the rest of the facility; single-cab mode, with either the ACFS or the 747-400 participating in the study; and dual-cab mode, with both cabs participating.Figure 11Figure 1 Photograph of VMS Tower with cut away view and artist rendering of motion system and interchangeable cab.Note size of tower in comparison to automobiles in lower left of picture.
