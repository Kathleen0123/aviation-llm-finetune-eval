If theCenter controllershavedeliveredaircraft at thegateson time usingthe DA tools,the TRACON controllers ordinarily will needto makeonly smallcorrectionsin therelativepositionsof aircraft to achievethe desiredspacing.The FAST assists the controllerin making thesecorrectionswith high accuracyanda minimum numberof headingvectorsandspeedclearances.Achievingprecisespacingbetweenaircraft on final approachensures thatlandingrateswill alwaysbe closeto thetheoreticalcapacityof the runway.Anothertype of tool designedfor the TRACON controlleris the TacticalAdvisor.This tool helps the controllerto replantraffic quickly in responseto several specialsituations,suchasmissed approaches, runway changes, andunexpected conflicts.
DESCENT ADVISORThis section begins with a brief review of descent procedures and continues with a detailed description of the DA.
Center Controller
Procedures for Managing Descent TrafficAn analysis of controller procedures for managing descent traffic provides important insight and motivation for designing the descent advisor system.Hence these procedures are briefly reviewed in preparation for describing the system in the next section.Typically, arrivals enter the airspace of the ARTCC that is feeding traffic to a major destination airport at least 200 n.mi.from the airport.Initially, the arrival traffic continues When aircraft destined for Denver first enter the airspace of the sector that is feeding traffic to the Drako arrival area, the DA algorithm computes an ETA to the time control waypoint, Jasin.In this computation the algorithm assumes the aircraft will continue to fly at cruise speed and altitude along the planned arrival route to the point of descent and then follow a standard profile descent at idle to the altitude specified at Jasin.This type of descent trajectory will also be referred to as a standard procedure profile (SP).The ETAs with their corresponding ID tags are then posted in green on the right-hand side of the time line.The arrival times are automatically updated approximately every 30 sec by the DA algorithm using the current position, velocity, altitude, and route information.After learningto interprettheinformationon the time line, the controller can use it to quickly assess the traffic situation at the designated time control point at various future times.Furthermore, he or she can gauge the effect of speed clearances and heading vectors by monitoring the ETAs posted on the time line.
Descent clearance advisors-In addition to providing ETAs on the time line, the DA algorithms can also provide more extensive assistance in solving the traffic management problems previously reviewed.To invoke the DA algorithms, the controller must first choose one or more aircraft of interest and then designate his choice to the computer by an action referred to as "selecting" an aircraft.An aircraft is selected by moving the mouse pointer to the position marker of a chosen aircraft, a small green diamond, and depressing (clicking) the left mouse button.If the pointer is within the acceptance aperture--a small region containing the diamond when the button is clicked--the color of the aircraft and all information associated with it on the screen turns from green to yellow.Similarly, a selected aircraft is deselected by clicking on its position marker, thereby changing its color back to green.For operational and computational reasons, the number of aircraft in the selected state should be kept to fewer than about five.
Selectingan aircraft causes two panels (also known as windows) to pop up on the screen (fig.3).The Mode Select Panel near the bottom of the screen provides a menu of labeled "buttons" for selecting advisory modes and display options.The functions of these modes will be explained in the next section.At the top of the screen, the DA Panel displays profile descent information generated by the DA algorithm.Each line in the panel provides various profile parameters and route data for one selected aircraft.These parameters are computed specifically for the type and weight of the arriving aircraft as well as the current estimate of the wind field.They are updated whenever the profile is refreshed, about every 10 sec.As on the time line, the ETAs of the selected aircraft determine the ordering of the lines in the panel, with the last-to-arrive aircraft occupying the top line.The parameters that define the profile descent trajectory of a selected aircraft consist of the desired cruise speed, the DME range of the top of descent point (TOD) from a nearby station (Denver VORTAC in this case) and the descent speed profile consisting of constant Mach and constant indicated airspeed (IAS) segments.Table 2 gives three example lines in the DA panel as well as the definition of each item in the line.A full explanation of some of the items will be found in later sections.A significant attribute of the system design is its rapid refresh feature.Every radar sweep or approximately every 10 sec the DA algorithm automatically recomputes the descent profiles and the ETAs of all selected aircraft.The profiles of the other aircraft continue to be updated at a slower rate.Thus, the information on the time line and in the DA panel adapts continuously (at a 10-sec rate for selected aircraft) to changes in aircraft position, altitude, heading, and airspeed.In addition to increasing the accuracy and timeliness of the information, this adaptive capability can be exploited by a controller skilled in its use to solve various traffic management problems.Time range bar-Whenan aircraftis selected, a yellow verticalbar with bracketsat the endsis displayednext to the time line atthe ETA of the aircraft.Thetime rangeenclosedby the bracketsindicates the maximumvariationof arrival time achievablethroughspeedprofile management alonga fixed arrival route.In particular,the endsof the bracketspoint atthe maximumandminimum arrival times obtainedby flying the aircraft alongits minimumandmaximumspeedenvelopes, respectively.It therefore follows thatthe ETAs for the SPprofile mustfall betweenor on the endpointsof the brackets.This is seento bethe casein figures3 and4.Overlappingbrackets, suchasthosein figure 3,indicatethatthe time rangesof someaircraftoverlap.To avoid ambiguitiesin this case,theoverlappingbracketsare slightly offsethorizontally.Top of descentmarker-Fromaircraftperformancestudiesit is well known that thelocationof the TOD point for a fuel efficient descent trajectorydependssignificantlyon thechoiceof the descent speed profile aswell ason manyotherfactors.Therefore,showingits locationon theplan view display (PVD) cangive thecontroller usefulcuesfor theefficient management of descent traffic.Its locationonthe PVD is indicatedwith a smallpurplemarkerwhich is labeledwith the appropriateaircraft ID (see fig. 3).The locationof the TOD markershouldnormallybe atleastseveral milesin front of the aircraft positionat thetime the descent clearance is issued.However,if theTOD andpositionmarkersappear to coincide,it indicatesthatthe aircraftis eitherator hasalreadypassedthe optimumpoint of descent.In this situationthe DA algorithmusesa mid-descent logic for generatingspeedprofiles,asexplainedin a later section.As long asthis logic canstill find a feasibledescent profile during theprofile refresh cycles,the TOD markerwill beseento trackthepositionmarker.The colocationof thesemarkersalerts thecontrollerthat theopportunityto initiate a descent alongthecurrentlypredictedhorizontalpathis aboutto disappear, unlesstheaircraft is alreadyflying a descent profile.If this lossof descent opportunity occurs,it is indicatedby the simultaneous disappearance of theTOD markerandthe postingof themessage "Path StretchingRequired"in theDA Clearance Panel for the affectedaircraft.The controller canremedythis situationby vectoringtheaircraft to stretchits horizontalpathuntil the lost informationreappears.The primaryuseof this markeris asa visualindicatorto help thecontrollerin judging the distanceremainingto the TOD point, andin properlytiming the issuanceof the descent clearance.Also, the markerscanassistthecontrollerin monitoringthe descents in mountainous terrain andin detectingpotentialconflictswith descending traffic or with overflights.The display of both ETAs and spacing markers on the PVD provides controllers with complementary tools for visualizing the future relationship of aircraft at a point in space.These graphic tools are more versatile and efficient for controllers to use than are the lists and tables found in the current ATC system.
Arrival time selection and advisories-An on-screen, interactive procedure is used for selecting arrival times and generating arrival time advisories, it is intended to be used primarily as a stand-alone manual mode.A more automated mode used in conjunction with the TMA is described in the next section.The first step in the procedure is to "select" an aircraft of interest and to watch for the time range bar to appear on the time line.The appearance of the bar indicates that the system is ready to accept a time command, and its length gives the time range available for selection.The aircraft ID tag located to the left of the time range bar serves both as a cursor for selecting a time and as a command input device for the DA algorithm.When an aircraft first enters the arrival area, the location of the cursor ID tag is initialized to the predicted time for the SP profile.Thus, both tags are initially located at the same point on the time line.The cursor tag can be relocated by moving the mouse pointer on top of the tag, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging it with the mouse to any point on the time line.A capture of the cursor tag by the mouse pointer is indicated by a change in color of the tag from yellow to white when the left mouse button is held down.The decisive moment for acceptance of a time command occurs when the mouse button is released.At that moment, the cursor position becomes the commanded time that is fed into the DA algorithm.If the cursor position is outside the time range brackets, the time of the nearest bracket is instead chosen as the commanded time.After the DA algorithm has finished its profile calcuhtion (in about a second) the new descent parameters are read into the DA Clearance Panel.At that time, the profile mode designator is changed from SP to I, where I stands for "Inquiry."Also, the ETA and its associated ID tag are relocated to the new position on the time line.This process was accomplished for TA 321 in figure 3. The "inquiry" designation indicates that the profile shown is the DA's response to the controller's "what if" question.The clearance corresponding to the inquiry profile has not been issued to the aircraft, which continues on its previous profile.The process of selecting new arrival times and generating the corresponding descent clearances can be repeated any number of times.Each time a new clearance is generated, the TOD and spacing markers arealsoupdated.Thus,the controllercanquickly assess the effectof different time commands on the trajectoryand,by making useof the spacingmarkers,determinewhetherit createsaconflict situation with othertraffic at variouswaypointsalongtheroute.As before,the DA algorithmautomaticallyrefreshestheprofile andcorresponding descent clearance approximatelyevery 10sec.At eachrefreshcycle,the algorithmreadsthe locationof the cursortag as well asthe currentaircraft state.It is alsopossibleto return to the original SPprofile by selectinga "Show SP"item in a pop-upmenu.Whenthe controllerhasfounda profile with a conflict-freearrival time, hecanlock in theprofile andclearanceby clicking on the associated ETA ID tag locatedto the right of the time rangebar.This actionsimultaneouslyfreezesthecurrentprofile andclearance, stopsthecyclic refreshingof the profile andchangesthe profile type designationfrom I to CLR, which standsfor cleared.It alsoplacesa * symbol next to theETA tag.This lockedprofile modeis illustratedby PA001in figure 3.In orderto prevent the lockedprofile from beingchangedinadvertently, the cursortag of the aircraftwith thelockedprofile is renderedinactive.However,the lockedprofile statecanbecancelledif necessary andthe aircraft returnedto theI-stateby clicking againon the starredtag.Whenanaircraft with a lockedprofile is deselected, the * remainsvisible, therebyproviding a markerto remind thecontrollerthatthe aircraft hadpreviouslybeenissueda profile descent clearance.Furthermore, thelocked clearance canberedisplayedby reselectingthe appropriateaircraft.
Meeting gate times sent by traffic management advisor-In the traffic management concept described earlier, optimum landing times are generated by an automatic scheduler, which resides in the TMA.As explained in a following section, the scheduler assigns landing times that merge the traffic flow from all four feeder gates while ensuring that the aircraft spacing requirements on final approach are observed.Then, the TMA transforms the landing times to gate arrival times and sends them to the DA located at the controller position feeding traffic to that gate.The DA tools and procedures described in the preceding section are applied here to assist the controller in generating advisories for meeting these scheduled times.The controller accesses the automatic scheduler, referred to as the TMA mode, by a keyboard command.In this mode, the green cursor, which was used in the preceding section to input a time command The lasttransactionin usingthesetwo modesis to deselect the pair of aircraft.Thenthe controller canconcentrate on identifying andpicking anotherpair of aircraft whosespacingneedsto becontrolled.Finally, it shouldbe notedthatthe SEP1andSEP2modescontrol the spacingonly atthe time control point.However,the spacingcanbecheckedupstreamof the time controlpoint by turning on the spacingmarkersatvariousspacingcheckpoints.
Horizontal Guidance ModesIn the preceding explanation of descent profiles and automation tools, the crucial problem of constmcting efficient horizontal paths for the aircraft was not addressed.In the previously discussed exampies, all of the aircraft were flying along standard jet routes.Here the methods used to construct the horizontal profiles are defined for both on-route and off-route situations.Routeinterceptpoints areindicatedon the PVD by white markerswith attachedaircraft identification tags.In addition,the sectionof circular flight paththatmergesthe aircraftonto the standard routeis alsodrawnon the PVD.The RI profiles shownfor the two selectedaircraftin figure 6 illustratebotha regularRI point for CO102andanexceptional casefor TWA61.The first RI point for TW61 on its current heading was found to be closer than the minimum allowed distance (25 n.mi.) from the junction of routes J56 and J170 at Estus.Hence, the second RI point located between the junction point and Drako was the one selected by the algorithm.The horizontal path synthesized in this mode consists of an initial circular arc turn starting at the current position and course followed by a straight flight segment leading directly to the time control point.The path is computed such that the end of the circular arc turn is tangent to the straight flight segment.The geometry of this construction is illustrated in figure 7. The algorithm determines the radius of the turn from the airspeed, wind speed, and maximum allowable bank angle.Furthermore, the direction of the turn toward the time control point is chosen so that the total length of the path is minimized.In order to compensate for computational delays and to allow for controller response time, the algorithm also moves the start of the turn at each computational cycle a distance equivalent to 15 sec of flight time ahead of the current aircraft position.
ConstructionOnce this logic has determined the parameters of the path, the DA algorithm synthesizes the speed and altitude profiles in exactly the same way as in the RI mode.As in other modes, the DA algorithm refreshes the waypoint capture profile in approximately a 10-sec cycle using updated aircraft state information.As illustratedin figure 8,the initial circular turn of the captureprofile is drawn on thePVD andis refreshedat the sametime thattheDA refreshes the trajectory.Thus,thearc tracksthepositionof the aircraftandmaintainsits tangencyto the current course of the aircraft, even as the aircraft performs complex maneuvers such as holding or path stretching.A white marker indicates the end of the circular arc and the beginning of the straight line segment on the PVD.A number next to the marker gives the magnetic heading in degrees of the straight line segment leading to the capture waypoint, Estus, whose name and position markers are drawn in yellow (fig.8).The spacing checkpoint is located at Drako and the time control point at Jasin in this figure.The most sophisticated application of this mode is in advising the controller when an off-route aircraft should be vectored toward the capture waypoint in order to capture a time slot at the time control waypoint.This includes solving the related problem of when to break out of a holding pattern to capture a time slot.In such applications, the general procedure is to vector an aircraft initially on a heading 30 °to 150 °away from a direct course to the capture waypoint.In figure 8, CO102 is heading in the proper direction for using this mode.As the aircraft continues on this course with the DA algorithm generating a sequence of waypoint capture profiles, the motion of the time range bar will slow down relative to that of the time line scale, indicating increasing delays.The greater the angle between the aircraft heading and the direct course to the time control point, the faster the delay will increase.When a specified arrival time on the time scale passes near the middle of the time range bar, the optimum time has been reachedfor the controller to issue the WC heading advisory shown on the PVD.This places the aircraft on a path to arrive approximately at the specified time.If the residual time error is excessive after the aircraft has executed the heading vector, the controller can zero out that error using the time control advisories _described in an earlier section.It is recognized that this procedure (as well as others described above)will be made more automated in future refinements of this tool.However, by initially providing the tool in this form, the controller retains maximum flexibility, and thus can tailor its use more easily to a variety of specific traffic situations.
Speed Profile ModesThree modes representing different constraints on generating speed profiles for time control have been implemented on the DA algorithm.They can be selected by clicking on a speed-profile-mode button located in the Mode Select Panel.Repeated clicks of the button cause each of the modes to be selected in succession.The names of the modes, in the order in which they are selected, are Descent (DA), Cruise-plus-Descent (C+D), and Cruise (C).The characteristics of each mode are described below.
Descentspeed mode--In this mode the DA algorithm achieves a specified arrival time by iterating on the descent speed profile only.Thus, while the aircraft is at cruise altitude, the cruise Mach number/ indicated airspeed (IAS) is not controlled by the algorithm.However, at each cyclic refresh of the profile, the cruise speed used as an initial condition by the algorithm is updated with information received from the National Airspace System Host Computer.Foreachaircraft type,the speedrangeavailablefor time control is specifiedby the maximum descent Machnumber,themaximumdescent IAS, andthe minimum descent IAS.For a 727theselimits havebeenchosenasMach 0.84,350KIAS, and230KIAS, respectively.In additionto providing time control,theDA algorithmalsoensures thatthe descent profile is optimally fuel efficient.It achievesthis first by choosingtheTOD point soasto minimize poweredflight at low altitudeandsecondby generatingaltitude-speed profiles thatpermit idle thrustflight throughout the descent.The typesof profiles aresimilar to thosegenerated by advancedflight management systems.The idle thrustconditionproducesaninterdependence of the speedandaltitudeprofiles.Thatis, for eachspeedprofile thereis a uniquealtitudeprofile thatcanbe flown atidle thrustwith the aircraftin the cleanconfiguration(no flapsandspeedbrakes).This interdependency changesthe TOD point whenever thespeedprofile changes.Furthermore, the altitudeprofile andTOD point alsodependon aircraftperformanceparameters andwinds.Forexample,the locationof theTOD point canmove25n.mi.or more whenthe speedprofile is changedfrom the fastestto the slowestdescent speed.The besttime to invoke this modeis while anaircraft is in cruiseandstill somedistancefrom the TOD point.However,the algorithmalsoprovidesspeedadvisoriesaftertheaircraft haspassed the TOD point or while the aircraft is descending.The part of theDA algorithmhandlingthesesituationsis called mid-descent logic.If an aircrafthasmovedpassed theoptimumTOD point or is alreadyin descent, this logic first computesthe constantdescent anglerequiredto reachthe desiredaltitudeof thetime control point from its currentposition.Thenit determinesthe speed rangewithin which theaircraft canfly at this descentangleandstill beableto decelerate to a specifiedfinal speed.In this step,the useof speed brakesis permittedin anypart of thedescent.The speed rangeobtainedwill grow smallerastheangleof descent increases.Eventually,asthe angleof descent reachesa critical value,the speedrangeshrinksto zeroandthe DA algorithmfails to generatea feasibleprofile.This modeshouldbeusedearlyin arrival sequencing whenan aircraft is atleast50 n.mi.from the TOD point.At a smallerdistance, the availabletime rangeis too smallto be usefulin arrival time control.By using cruisespeedcontrol only, the controllercancompletemostof therepositioningof anaircraft necessary to achievea specifiedarrival time beforethe aircraftbeginsits descent.Sincethe descent profiles in this modeareall basedon standard proceduretypes,the speeddifferential betweenin-trail descendingaircraft is likely to besmall.This hasthe advantage of minimizing the occurrence of overtakesandtherebyhelpsreducethecontroller's effort in monitoringthedescenttraffic.
Cruise-plus-descentspeed mode--This mode provides the greatest possible time range by allowing the DA algorithm to control both the cruise speed and the descent speed profiles.The speed limits that determine the extreme values of the time range are generally identical to those used in the other two speed-control modes.An exception to this rule is the maximum Mach number in descent which in this case is set equal to the maximum cruise Mach number.This assumption sacrifices a small amount of time range but has the advantage of simplifying both the algorithm and, as will be shown below, the specification of the speed clearances.In generating a cruise-plus-descent speed profile, the algorithm first attempts to meet the specified arrival time by cruise speed control only.If the attempt succeeds, the profiles generated are similar to those in the cruise speed mode.If the attempt fails, cruise speed will have reached one of its limits without achieving the specified arrival time.Descent speed control is then initiated with the cruise speed set from the limit value.Another condition imposed on the descent speed profile is that the Mach number of the constant Mach descent segment, if one is necessary, be the same as the Mach number in cruise.This condition limits the number of the speed clearance parameters that the controller has to issue to two, which is the same as for the other two modes.When an aircraft is less than 25 n.mi.from the TOD point of the SP profile, the algorithm reverts to descent speed control only.Plots of Mach number, IAS, and altitude as a function of range for maximum, minimum, and nominal speed profiles in cruise and descent are given in figure 10.
Computation of Profile Tracking ErrorsAs explained in a preceding section, the controller normally "locks" a profile immediately after issuing to an aircraft the clearances displayed in the DA clearance panel.Locking the profile sends a signal to the DA algorithm to cease generating new profiles and initiate tracking of the locked profile.The profile tracking process consists of computation of errors in time, lateral position, and altitude between the current position of the aircraft and the locked profile.As the first step in computing these errors, the error tracking algorithm determines if the current aircraft position lies within a three-dimensional corridor centered around the locked profile.In the horizontal plane, the corridor extends 4 n.mi. on each side of the center of the locked profile, while in the vertical plane it extends 1000 ft above and below the altitude of the locked profile.These corridor dimensions can be changed for different conditions.Where the horizontal path consists of a circular turn segment, such as in a transition between two straight line segments, the corridor takes the shape of an annulus (fig.11).If the current aircraft position is found to be outside this corridor, the aircraft is considered to be off track, and the rest of the error computations are skipped.If the aircraft is within the route corridor, the error computation algorithm first projects the actual aircraft position onto the path of the locked profile in order to locate a projected position (see fig. 11).Then it determines the increment or decrement in current time needed to bring the locked profile position into coincidence with the projected position.An increment in time corresponds to early arrival (negative time error) and a decrement to late arrival (positive time error).The time error, in seconds, is displayed in the DA panel to the right of the locked profile arrival time.In figure 3, PA 001 has accumulated a small time error relative to its locked (DA) profile.The time error is also incorporated in the position of the predicted arrival time along the time line via algebraic addition of the time error tothe locked profile arrival time.Thus, even when the locked clearance is no longer displayed in the DA clearance panel, the controller can still monitor the time error by comparing the blue scheduled time (or the green cursor position, as the case may be) with the predicted arrival time.In This condition places important computational constraints on the algorithm.Since the scheduler is the main computational unit of the TMA, its functions and operations are described first.Next is a description of the graphical interface and the set of tools the traffic manager uses to monitor and to interact with the scheduler in real time.
DefinitionsThe variables and parameters that play crucial roles in the operation of the scheduler are defined and explained below.These definitions apply equally to schedulers designed for the Center and the TRACON.
Estimated time of arrival (ETA):The ETA plays a decisive role in the operation of the TMA and its scheduler.
Scheduled time of arrival (STA):This time is generated by the scheduler.Scheduling horizon: This is a time interval specified by the traffic manager.It determines when an aircraft is first added to the list of aircraft currently being scheduled, referred to as the schedulable list.An aircraft is added to this list when its time to landing based on its current ETA first penetrates (becomes less than the time of) the scheduling horizon.This parameter is individually adjustable for each of the four arrival areas.Typical values will be discussed shortly.
Freeze horizon:This traffic manager specified time interval determines when an aircraft STA becomes frozen and is transferred from the schedulable list to the frozen STA aircraft list.Scheduling window: The time interval between the scheduling horizon and the freeze horizon is the scheduling window.Aircraft whose time to landing (based on ETA) fall in this window make up the list of schedulable aircraft.The scheduler generates new STAs for this list when an aircraft in it receives an updated ETA, when a new aircraft is added to the list or when the traffic manager makes parameter changes.Thus, the STA of an aircraft in the scheduling window is subject to revision until it drops below the freeze horizon.It should be noted that the placement of an aircraft in the schedulable list depends solely on its ETA and not on its STA generated by the scheduler.
Blocked
Althoughthe scheduling and freeze horizons were defined above as time dependent quantities, they can also be approximated in the spatial domain by concentric circles with the arrival airport at the center.The circles representing the horizons are superimposed in figure 12 on the arrival airspace structure of the Denver Center.The location of the freeze horizon (in space and time) must balance two conflicting objectives.On the one hand, it must be chosen sufficiently early in the approach in order to give the arrival controllers adequate time and airspace to meet the scheduler-generated STAs.This control process takes place between the freeze horizon where scheduled times are broadcast to the arrival controllers, and the feeder gates where traffic leaves the Center airspace and enters the TRACON.At the very latest, the freeze horizon must be chosen before arrivals reach the area where descent clearances are issued.This area is about 30 min to touchdown.On the other hand, the location of the freeze horizon should not be chosen so early that arrivals from nearby airports often appear later than the freeze horizon, thus missing the scheduling window altogether.Also, an early freeze horizon increases the probability of scheduledisturbing events occurring between the freeze horizon and the TRACON boundary, such as weather disturbances.The rescheduling of frozen aircraft necessitated by such occurrences causes an undesirable increase in controller workload, and thus should be minimized.These considerations, as well as the results of simulation tests and experience with the current metering system at the Denver Center suggest a time range of 35-45 min to touchdown as a reasonable time range for the freeze horizon.In order for the scheduler to have the greatest freedom in optimizing arrival schedules and sequences, the scheduling horizon should be chosen as far out as possible thereby maximizing the width of the scheduling window.However, its maximum width is constrained by the location of the Center boundary unless detailed aircraft data can be obtained from adjacent Centers.In general, the greater the width of the scheduling window, the more nearly optimal will be the arrival sequences generated by the scheduler.Whenit becomes necessary to reschedule certainaircraft,thelast andbestopportunityto do so occursin theregion wherethearrivalstransitionfrom the Centerinto theTRACON at thefeedergates.This regionis identifiedin figure 12 asthe TRACON reschedulingregion.In this transitionregion,the schedulingprocessdescribedabovecanberepeatedto a limited degreeby theTRACON scheduler which is embedded in the FAST.Sincethe schedulingwindowis narrowandcloseto touchdown, reschedulingin FAST consistsprimarily of fine tuning theCenter-determined arrival sequence.Extensivechangesin the schedulefor arrivalsthis closeto therunway areneithernecessary nor feasible.Frequentreorderingof arrival sequences or largechanges in STAs atthis point would disruptthe orderlinessof the arrival flow andproducecomplextrajectoriesin the TRACON airspace, therebyincreasing controllerworkload.Theprimaryreasonfor reschedulingaircraftin theTRACON airspacearisesfrom the needto handlemissedapproaches, emergencyaircraft,andchangesin runway.The first stepin all four schedulingmethodsis to arrangeaircraft in the schedulable list in orderof their ETAs.Thus,the aircraft with the earliestETA is placedat the bottomof the list andtheaircraft with the latestETAis placedatthe top of the list.
Design of SchedulerThe next stepperformedby the FCFSscheduler is to checkthe interaircrafttime spacingsonfinal approach.For thosewith lessthanthe minimum allowed,the scheduler addsjust enoughtime to meet the minimum distanceseparationstandards requiredby FAA regulations.It shouldbenotedthatthe minimum separationdistances dependon the aircraftweight classes(heavy,large,andlight) of the leadingandtrailing aircraft.Here,heavyaircraftareprimarily wide body,largeaircraft arenarrowbody, andlight aircraft aregeneral aviationaircraft.Sincethe scheduler works on thebasisof time andnot distance,it is first necessary to transformthedistances into equivalenttime separations usingprocedures describedin reference6.The resultsof thesetransformations area setof time intervalswhich specifythe minimum time spacingson final approachfor all nine possiblelanding sequences of aircraft with three weightclasses.A complicatingfactoris thatthe transformations dependimplicitly on the groundspeed of aircrafton final approach.Sincegroundspeed dependson bothfinal approachair speedandwind speed, it becomes necessary to updatethe time spacingsin real time.This cumbersome andcomplicated procedureshouldbeeliminatedby developingnewcriteria specificallyfor time-basedminimum separation standards.The operationof the FCFSschedulingalgorithmon the schedulable list canbeillustratedgraphically with thehelp of time lines drawn sideby sideasin figure 13(a).The time line on theright showsthe ETAs of several largeandheavyaircraftwithin a schedulingwindow.As in the DA time line, the earli-estETA is at the bottomof thelist andincreasingfuturetime is towardthe top.Forillustrative purposes, only two minimum separationtimesareused,2 min.for a heavyfollowedby a largeaircraft and1 min.for all othersequences.Sincethe time separations betweenETAs in this list aregenerallysmallerthan theminimums,the scheduler hasto delayaircraft to conformwith the minimums.The resultof this operationis shownon the STA time line.Here,horizontallines connectSTAsandETAs of the same aircraft.The original ETA orderhasbeenmaintainedasindicatedby the fact thatnoneof the connecting linescrosseachother.The effectof addingthe time advanceoption to the FCFSscheduler is illustratedin figure 13(b).A 1-mintime advancerelativeto theETA wasallowedfor eachaircraft.The effectfor manyaircraftis a reductionof delay andfuel consumption.Onthe otherhand,thoseaircraft whosetime is advanced may experience increasedfuel consumptionbecause of higher-than-optimal cruiseanddescentspeeds.Therefore,in assessing the overallbenefitof time advance, it is necessary to balancetime andfuel savingsfor thoseaircraft whosedelaysarereducedagainstanincreasein fuel consumptionfor thosewhose time is advanced.Nevertheless, in mostsituations, time advanceis likely to be advantageous.In considerationof thesetrade-offs,the scheduler attemptsto beintelligent in applying time advance by not advancingaircraft whenthe benefitsto be gainedareminimal.The scheduler doesthis in two ways.First, the amountof advanceis controlledby specifyingboth a maximumadvanceanda fraction of the total advanceavailablethatis to beapplied.The scheduler first determinestheminimum time to landingfor a given aircraft aspreviouslydefined.Only a fraction of the total advanceavailableis used by the scheduler.This amountis comparedwith the maximumallowableadvanceandthesmallerof the two quantitiesis usedto arrive atthe aircraft's scheduled time.
Description of Graphical Interface and ToolsSimilar to the interface for the DA previously described, the interface for the TMA is also based upon exploiting the interaction between workstation screen and the mouse.The workstation screen is divided into one large and t_ee small nonoverlapping windows.The large window on _e left in figure 14  Someof the waysin which the traffic managercaninteractwith the automaticscheduler will now be covered.In the following explanations, frequentreferencewill bemadeto figure 15.This figure shows two time lines.The time line on theright displaysETAs while the time line on the left displaysSTAsfor the samesetof aircraft.Manual scheduling-The traffic manager canalterthe scheduled time of anyaircraft currentlyin the system(includingthosewhich havenot yetbeenscheduled, andthosewhosetimes arealreadyfrozen).This is doneby placingthe mousecursorover theaircraft time line _ag, depressing themiddle buttonof the three-buttonmouseusedin Sunworkstationsand_agging thetag to a newlocation(time) on the time line.As soonasthe middle buttonis released, thecomputerwill generateanddisplayanupdated schedule.Aircraft scheduled in this fashionaredisplayedin purple to highlight the fact thatthey have beenmanuallyscheduledby the controller.In the figure bothPA001andSP404havebeenmanually scheduled.Blocked slots are slightly more complicated.They are created by placing the mouse cursor in the same area as before but using the right mouse button to display a menu of slot options.Heavy, large, and small slots can be added by selecting the appropriate menu item.The figure shows a heavy slot just past the 55-min mark.UnlNe the procedure for inte_als, the amount of airspace reserved by the slot depends on the weight classes of other aircraft being scheduled, just as though a slot were an actual aircraft.Notice in the figure that UA 134 has been moved behind the heavy slot even though it was ahead of it on the time line.This is because not enough time exists behind UA134 based on its current ETA to provide the minimum separation required between it and the heavy slot.Since the slot is fixed, the scheduler has to move UA 134.face that allows the traffic manager to modify the computer generated schedules for specific aircraft while allowing the automatic scheduler to continue generating schedules for all other aircraft. The graphical interface also provides convenient methods for monitoring the traffic flow and changing scheduling parameters duringthe design of an automated air traffic control system based on a hierarchy of advisory tools for controllers.Compatibility of the tools with the human controller, a key objective of the design, is achieved by a judicious selection of tasks to be automated and careful attention to the design of the controller system interface.The design comprises three interconnected subsystems referred to as the Traffic Management Advisor, the Descent Advisor, and the Final Approach Spacing Tool.Each of these subsystems provides a collection of tools for specific controller positions and tasks.This paper focuses on the design of two of these tools, the Descent Advisor, which provides automation tools Descent Advisor tools is integrated into a plan view traffic display consisting of a high-resolution color monitor.Estimated arrival times of aircraft are presented graphically on a time line, which is also usedinteractively in combination with a mouse input device to select and schedule arrival times.Other graphical markers indicate the location of the fuel-optimum topfor use by the Center traffic manager in controlling the flow of traffic into the terminal area.The primary algorithm incorporated in it is a real-time scheduler which generates efficient landing sequences and landing times for arrivals within about 200 n.m. from touchdown.Four scheduling algorithms have been implemented in the scheduler; they are run first-come-first-served with or without time advance and position shifting with or without time advance.A unique feature of the TMA is its graphical interreal-time operation.The Descent Advisor and the Traffic Management Advisor have been implemented on a network of workstations, which distributes the computational load, INTRODUCTION Although automated decision systems for air traffic control (ATC) have been investigated for at least two decades, attempts to implement these systems in the current ATC environment have largely failed.
aircraft, can also be displayed on an extra line in the aircraft data block.Since the extra line may cause excessive crowding of the display under heavy traffic conditions, it can be turned off by a mouse actuated on-screen switch.Some of the data blocks for selected aircraft in figures 3 and 4 have this profile clearance line switched on.
checking the spacing between aircraft at any waypoint on the arrival routes.The location of the markers on the screen are based on the DA-generated trajectory parameters currently displayed in the DA Clearance Panel, and therefore are refreshed at the same update rate.The time control point or any waypoint upstream of it can be designated as the spacing check point by choosing a mouse-actuated pop-up menu item.The name and position marker of the spacing check point are drawn in dark blue.(Drako in fig.3).The markers are displayed on the PVD by clicking on the spacing button in the Mode Select Panel.They consist of small blue dots which have leader lines to an aircraft identification tag and a number representing the distance in nautical miles to the spacing check point (Drako) (fig.3).The aircraft ID associated with the marker at the spacing check point identifies the first of the selected aircraft, referred to as the leading aircraft, to arrive at the spacing check point.Markers for all other selected aircraft are placed at locations corresponding to the instant that the leading aircraft arrives at the spacing check point.For convenience, the separation distances from the leading aircraft are also displayed in the DA clearance panel.The markers play an analogous role in the spatial domain as do the ETA markers on the time line.The spacing markers can be used to probe quickly for conflicts at various points on the arrival routes.For example, the controller can check for conflicts at critical route junction points such as Estus, as well as at Drako or at the time control point, Jasin.Since the markers are computed from the DA trajectories, they provide the ability to check for future conflicts along complex descent trajectories.
of a horizontal path always begins at the current position and heading of the aircraft and terminates at the time control point.Its calculation is a prerequisite for the subsequent synthesis of the descent profile.The controller has a choice of two horizontal guidance modes, referred to as Route Intercept (RI) and Waypoint Capture (WC).They are selected by clicking on the appropriately labeled button in the Mode Select Panel.The controller also can assign a horizontal guidance mode to an individual aircraft without changing the modes of the others.This is done by displaying a pop-up menu at a specific aircraft and selecting the desired mode with the mouse cursor.Route intercept (RI) mode-This mode operates in conjunction with the set of standard jet arrival routes converging on the time control point.The routes recognized by the DA algorithm in the Drako feeder gate approach sectors are those drawn in blue on the PVD.They have a corridor width of +4 n.mi.relative to its center line.Other feeder gates have their own set of standard arrival routes.In calculating a profile, the DA algorithm first determines if the aircraft position falls within a corridor of one of the standard routes and if its course is within 120 °of the route direction at its current location.If the aircraft passes these two tests, the DA algorithm then uses its on-route logic to construct the horizontal path.This is done by concatenating all standard arrival route segments traversed when moving from the current aircraft position to the time control point.It includes circular arc segments to transition smoothly from one segment to another where a change in course occurs at junction points.ff the aircraft fails at least one of these tests, the DA algorithm declares it off-course and invokes the RI logic.This logic, illustrated in figure 5, seeks to create an RI segment connecting the current aircraft position to a point on a standard route segment.First, the algorithm generates a directed line, called the aircraft course vector, which emanates from the current position and points in the direction of the aircraft course over the ground.Then it searches for points of interception of the course vector with standard route segments.As a rule, the first point of interception found establishes where the aircraft joins the standard route.Next, the logic creates a new route by concatenating the RI segment with the segments of standard route traversed between the RI point and the time control point.From here on, the DA algorithm generates speed and altitude profiles in exactly the same manner as if the new route were a standard route.One exception to the rule of choosing the first point of interception arises when that point falls 25 n.mi.or less in front of a junction point and a second point of interception occurs on the downstream side of the junction point.In this case, the RI logic chooses a path to the second interception point.Thereareotherexceptional casesincorporatedin theRI logic, but a descriptionof theseis deferredto a future publication.Hereit sufficesto saythattheexactconditionsof capturearehighly dependent bothon the geometryof the routestructureandthe established controllerprocedures in an arrival sector.
The controller can block out times in which he does not want aircraft to be scheduled as previously defined.Two kinds of blocked times are displayed in the figure in red; intervals and slots.An interval is represented by double red bars.The scheduler will not place any aircraft in the area delimited by the blocked interval.This area is created by placing the mouse cursor anywhere within the two vemcal lines on either side of the minute numbers and _agging with the middle mouse button depressed.The figure shows an interval which caused delays for CO409.Notice that the scheduler has placed aircraft right at the limits of the blocked interval.

chosen if only the speed profile of the trailing aircraft can be modified to change the spacing, while the speed profile of the leading aircraft must remain unchanged.If this attempt fails, the DA algorithm then changes the speed profile of the leading aircraft in an effort to achieve the desired spacing.Spacingadvisories-Two advisory modes are available for generatingdescent clearancesthat meetspecifiedspacing distancesat the time control point. The two modes are invoked by clicking on one orthe other of the buttons labeled SEP_ONEand SEP_TWOin the Mode Select Panel.Before using either mode, the controllermust choose a desired spacing distancein nautical miles andenter it via the keyboard.The current value of 10 n.mi. shown in figures 3 and 4 is displayedin theMode Select Panel to the fight of the SEP_TWObutton. Anotherrequirementfor activatingthese modesis that exactly two aircraft must be in the selected state. As a rule, the controllershould pick two consec-utively arrivingaircraft that are 15 to 35 min of flight time from the feeder gate. The arrival timesequencedisplayedon the time line and the spacing markers provide informationto help the controllerchoose an appropriatepair.After selectinga pair of aircraft and observingthat the spacing markers predict a spacing sufficientlydifferentfrom the specifiedvalue at the time control waypoint,the controllercan choose one or the otherof the two spacing modes to assist in achievingthe desired spacing.The SEP_ONE mode should be Clicking on SEP_ONE causes the DA algorithmto search for a speed profile for the trailing aircraft suchthat the resultingspacing distancewill match the specifiedvalue as closely as possible.After the DAalgorithmhas completedthe calculation,the new clearanceis posted in the DA ClearancePanel and thespacing markers are updated.Also, the profile mode indicatorsare changed from SP to I. As for all SPand I profile types, the DA algorithmrefreshesthe profile and its correspondingclearancein a 10-seccycle, each time using updatedaircraft state information.The clearancefor TA 321 and the correspond-ing spacing distancebetween TA 321 and AA 404 obtained by invokingSEP_ONEis shown in figure 4.In this example,both the time control point and the spacing check point are located at Drako. Thespacing distanceis also displayedin the DA ClearancePanel.If the spacing distanceachievedwith SEP_ONEis inadequate,the controllercan invoke theSEP_TWOmode. This mode gives the DA algorithmthe freedomto change the speed profiles of bothtrailing and leading aircraft.As in the SEP_ONEmode, the DA algorithmfirst attempts to achieve themanually, by the automatic is removed scheduler. from the time line. In its place, a blue ID tag appears at the gate time determined The time line in figure 8 illustrates the TMA mode of operation. If neces-sary, however, the controller can still assign his own gate times by returning specified spacing by changing only the trailing-aircraft speed profile. The controller must decide which of the two modes to use based on an assessment of the prevailing the DA to the manual mode described in the preceding section. To obtain advisory clearances for meeting traffic situation in his sector. For example, he would probably decide not to use the SEP_TWO mode if the gate time, the con-troller first selects the appropriate he previously had issued a descent clearance to the leading aircraft or if the leading aircraft is itself in aircraft as before, and then clicks on the blue ID tag. That causes the DA algorithm to enter the inquiry profile mode, and begin generating profiles and advisories for the trail and at a minimum spacing distance behind another aircraft.selected aircraft. If the blue ID tag position falls within the time range bar, the speed and descent advi-sories shown in the DA panel correspond to permissible aircraft trajectories that will cause the aircraft to If the controller judges the spacing distances to be acceptable, he would then proceed to issue thearrive at the scheduled appropriate clearance(s)gate time. As previously to the aircraft. At that point, he should lock in the profiles explained, conflicts along the route can be checked by and clearances byusing the spacing markers. clicking on the "ok" button in the Mode Select Panel. This action terminates The controller can lock any currently displayed by clicking on the ETA tag. He can also redisplay and revise the clearance profiles and freezes the currently displayed clearance. As was the case for the Time Control Advisories, clearance the cyclic refreshing of the he finds acceptable by applying previouslydescribed locking the profiles changes procedures.the profile type indicatorfrom I to CLR and places a * symbol after theETA tag. The profilescan be unlockedby previouslydescribedprocedures.
time interval: This is an interval of time in which aircraft are not allowed to bescheduled.Such intervalscan be entered manuallyinto the TMA data base by the trafficmanager.It providesa means to specify a temporaryclosure of the runway,or to reservetime intervals for takeoffs and emergencies.Blockedtime slot: This designatesa time slot for an aircraft not being tracked by theCenter radar but expectedto land at the specifiedtime. Such aircraft may originateatnearby feeder airports or fly at altitudes too low to be tracked by the Center radar. Theschedulertreats a blockedtime slot as a specific type of aircraft with a specifiedlandingtime.
The secondtechniqueusedby the scheduler is to advancea given aircraftonly whenit is part of a closely spacedgroupof aircraft.A closely spaced groupis definedasa setof consecutive aircraft which are spaced at or below the minimumallowableseparation.The number of consecutiveaircraft which defines a group is an adjustableparam-eter, typicallyset to four.A positionshifting schedulerwith or without time advance removesthe constraintof preservingtheETA order when generatingthe STA list. Position shifting for aircraft schedulingwas studied by Dear(ref. 7) and subsequentlyby others (ref. 8). The schedulerimplementedhere optimizesthe STA list withrespect to one positionshift. This means that the landing order of an aircraft may not be moved morethan one aircraft ahead of or behind the FCFS order. The schedule producedby the position shift sched-uler with time advanceis illustratedin figure 13(c)forthe same schedulablelist as before. It can be seenthat positionshifting has providedadditionaldelay reduction.However,these reductionsare highlydependenton the mix of aircraft in the list. There would be no advantagein position shifting if theminimumtime separationbetween all aircraft were the same. Position shifting tends to bunch aircraft ofthe same weight class as in figure 13(c). Althoughpositionshifting can reduce delays, it is not alwaysfeasible to implement.For example,position shifting of two in-trail aircraft generallyrequires one air-craft to overtakethe other. This procedureincreasescontrollerworkload,making position shifting unde-sirable. Therefore,the schedulerhas been designedto allow position shifting only if it can be completedbefore the position-shiftedpair has merged on a common route.
For example, onepossibledisplayconfiguration,which is illustratedin figure 14,usestheleft trackof the leftmosttime line to displaySTAsfor thetwo northern gates, Drako andKeannandthe fight trackof thattime line to displaythe STAsfor the two southern gates, Byson andKiowa.The samerule is usedto segregate the ETAs on the secondtime line, andthe flight plan ETAs on the third time line.This leavesthefourth time line asa spare(shownasturnedoff in fig.14).Sincetraffic from thenorthernandsouthemgatesgenerallylandson the northernandsouthern parallelrunways,respectively,at Denver,this displayconfigurationalsohasthe advantage of segregatingthe flows by landingrunway.As previouslydescribedfor theDA time line, aircraft time schedules movetowardthe bottomof their respectivetime lines astime increases.Moreover, under normal circumstances, aircraft schedules will be observed to migrate from the fight to the left time lines.An aircraft first appears on the flightplan time line at the time the Center receives its flight plan and planned ETA.When the aircraft becomesmonitoringandmanagingtraffic flows. active in the Center airspace, its ETA is updatedand it is simultaneouslyremoved from the flight plantime line and displayedon the ETA time line. Finally, when its ETA penetratesthe scheduling horizon,its STA is computedand then displayedon the STA time line.Color coding of aircraft IDs and graphicalmarkers are used on the time lines to convey the aircraftschedulingstatus and critical schedulingparameters.The schedulingwindowsappear as yellow verticalbars on each side of the ETA time line. Aircraft IDs appear in green on the flight plan and ETA timeline. On the STA time line, scheduledaircraft with yellow IDs designateaircraft whose ETA is in theschedulingwindow.At the time the ETA of an aircraft falls below the freeze horizon, its color on theSTA time line changesfrom yellow to blue.
