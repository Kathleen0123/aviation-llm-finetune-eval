IntroductionAs of December 2016, there were more than 670,000 registered small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) in the United States, 626,000 as hobbyists § § and 44,000 as commercial.These numbers are expected to grow rapidly over the coming years [1].Operations of these aircraft beyond hobby or recreation in the U.S. is currently regulated by Federal Aviation Regulation part 107 (Part 107), and numerous Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) applications including aerial photography, real estate, construction, industrial and utility inspection and agriculture are enabled under this regulation [2].Operations beyond what is allowed under Part 107, such as Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations, operations over people, and night operations, are enabled through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s waiver process [3].Whereas the FAA strives to review and issue decisions within 90 days in this process, a limited number of waivers are granted, as there is no established infrastructure to integrate large-scale beyond-Part 107 operations into the National Airspace System (NAS) without endangering people or property on the ground or in the air.To safely and efficiently integrate the full gamut of small UAS operations at low altitudes, NASA has developed the UAS Traffic Management platform [4,5] to research and develop promising technologies and data exchange protocols to support routine and widespread execution of present and future envisioned applications such as urban area package delivery and BVLOS infrastructure inspection, and also to perform conceptual and technical research that can be transferred to the FAA in the form of airspace integration requirements for further testing.For this transfer, NASA and the FAA formed the UTM Research Transition Team (RTT) with goals to research and mature increasingly complex UTM operational scenarios and technologies; demonstrate those capabilities on the NASA UTM research platform; and deliver to the FAA technology transfer packages that enable NAS service expectations for low-altitude airspace operations by providing insight and capability requirements for critical services [6].Given the wide technological areas and operating environments that the UTM RTT is addressing, the team has been divided into four focus subgroups, Concepts and Use Cases (CWG); Data Exchange and Information Architecture (DWG); Sense and Avoid (SAA); and Communications and Navigation (C&N).The CWG is providing the conceptual framework, scenarios, and use cases for the other subgroups to explore.The DWG works to identify, develop, and test expected data exchanges and architectural implications and challenges.The SAA and C&N work to identify and evaluate key performance and operations challenges and constraints.Outputs from the DWG, the SAA, and the C&N subgroups in turn inform the CWG to progressively elaborate the UTM concept of operations.This paper describes a part of C&N activities where the small UAS off-nominal operational situations data collection process has been developed to gain lessons learned, and to reinforce operational compliance to ensure that the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) is under operational control of the pilot and remains within a defined area.Specifically, descriptions of variables for digital data collection and an online report form for collection of contextual data, defined in this paper as observational data from the UAS operators, are provided.These variables and form were used to collect off-nominal data from the UTM National Campaign in 2017, and two off-nominal operational events, loss of navigation and loss of command and control (C2) link are examined using the digital data.Additionally, contextual reports collected via the online form are used to investigate circumstances of the off-nominal events and actions taken by the operators.The paper is concluded with discussion on limitations found from this initial off-nominal data collection approach and the next steps.
II. Brief Description of UTM TCL2 National CampaignIn 2017, NASA contracted with six FAA UAS Test Sites [7] to demonstrate the UTM capability at that time, Technical Capability Level 2 (TCL2), that supports VLOS and BVLOS operations over sparsely populated land and where there are few manned aircraft in close proximity to the UA operations area.The goals of this demonstration, known as the UTM TCL2 National Campaign (NC II), are to test scenarios across a wide range of UAS platforms and locations across the U.S., and to utilize then-recently-developed UAS Service Supplier (USS) and Flight Information Management System (FIMS) architecture to validate further the scalability of the UTM concept and architecture.To achieve these goals, NASA guided the Test Sites to design and execute flight operations to meet one or more of the following objectives.1. Conduct operations with a TCL 2-compatible USS that was not developed by NASA 2. Conduct operations to test and determine information requirements between the components of the UTM platform 3. Test USS and human operator reactions to simulated Air Navigation Service Provider constraints and directives 4. Test and determine weather service information requirements § § Owner-hobbyist can register once and apply the same registration number to multiple aircraft.Therefore, there can be more UAS than the number of registrations. 5. Test surveillance services 6.Test and evaluate scheduling and planning capabilities 7. Evaluate best practices for ground-based sense and avoid 8. Evaluate geofencing and conformance monitoring capabilities 9. Gather data to develop communication and navigation guidance to industry to ensure that 1) UA are under operational control of the pilot, and 2) UA remain within a defined area 10.Evaluate human factors requirements related to data creation and display 11.Demonstrate a BVLOS package delivery while other aircraft are operating nearby.The NC II flight operations took place from May 15 th to June 9 th , and data from these operations were captured for analysis.The participating FAA test sites, test locations, test range descriptions, vehicle types and USS providers are shown in Table 1.Appendix A shows the FIMS-USS architecture used in the NC II.Further information about the NC II, such as test scenarios for each test site and discussion on measure of performance, can be found in [8].
III. Description of Off-nominal Data Collection Approaches
A. Variables for Digital Off-nominal Data CollectionThe NC II Data Management Plan (DMP) consists of four data sets; Aircraft Flight Plan; UAS specifications; UAS State; and Auxiliary UAS Operation.Several variables were added to the last three sets to collect off-nominal operational situation data.
Aircraft Flight PlanThe first set of the data compendium is an Aircraft Flight Plan, which specifies the date and time of the flight, UAS Vehicle Identification Number (UVIN), which is the vehicle identification number for a single aircraft that is obtained from a prototype NASA USS, Globally Unique Flight Identifier (GUFI), which is the individual flight identification number generated by a USS, waypoint location (Latitude/Longitude/Altitude), target air and ground speeds, hover time and a timestamp based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) week/second standard.Additionally, an "as run" version of a flight test card or procedure was used by the test participant during the execution of the test for archiving and analysis.
UAS SpecificationsSpecifications for each UAS used in the flight test are collected in this set.These include UAS maker/model, UVIN, and aircraft characteristics such as dimensions, and performance and Ground Control System (GCS) information.For off-nominal data collection, variables to capture communication system sensitivity, communications protocol, navigation system, navigation solution errors and others are added to this set.
UAS StateUAS State data refers to time-dependent data taken during flight.Each data point is tagged with UVIN, GUFI and the date & time of the flight in GPS time.Collected data includes real-time position (Latitude/Longitude/Altitude) and velocity of the vehicle, sensor information, attitude, motor conditions, actuator commands, battery status, target waypoints and aircraft airborne state.For off-nominal operation situation analysis, types of data collected by the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system [10,11] and UAS operation specific data types, such as C2 link Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measured at aircraft and GCS, are added to this set.
Auxiliary UAS OperationThis set encompassed all the time-independent data that was not part of the Flight Plan or uniquely related to the UAS Specifications.Operators provided UVIN, GUFI, type of operation (e.g."live" or "simulated"), airframe, flight test card, takeoff weight and location, and landing location.For off-nominal data collection, GCS location variables are added to this set.A NASA-hosted website *** was created to intake the DMP-compliance data.Appendix B shows all DMP variables that were used to collect data from the NC II operations, where off-nominal data variables' names are highlighted in bold typeface.
B. Online Report Form for Contextual DataTo collect contextual data, an online form was developed based on a general report form used by the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) [11][12][13].ASRS uses its form to gather details and background information about commercial Aviation incidents and accidents, and it was determined that a similar form can be used to gather information about small UAS off-nominal operational situations.Appendix C shows the questions in the NC II online form.During the NC II, UAS operators were asked to complete the form if any of the following events occurred: a loss or degradation of communication between the vehicle and the GCS; a loss or degradation of any navigation signal, or any other navigation system failure; any lateral or vertical excursion from planned flight geography; and any loss of vehicle control, including propulsion system, flight control system, or vehicle structural problems or failures.Completing the form was entirely voluntary.
IV. The NC II Off-Nominal Data Analysis ResultsMore than 1700 operation plans were submitted in real-time to the USS during the NC II.Since these plans included ground tests and shakedown flights, significant filtering effort involving manual and automated processes were made to identify118 data collection flights.The off-nominal situation investigation was limited to these flights.The collected digital data were used to investigate loss of navigation and loss of C2 link off-nominal situations.The collected contextual data was evaluated by an ASRS Subject Matter Expert to better understand off-nominal situations.
A. Loss of NavigationFrom the NC II digital data, the number of GPS satellites tracked by the GPS receiver in the navigation system onboard UA, represented as a variable "numGpsSat_nonDim," is used to reflect the loss of navigation off-nominal operational situation.This off-nominal situation is detected when the aircraft navigation system tracks six or fewer satellites for ten seconds or more.The six-satellite threshold number was selected, as lower than the baseline for ideal operating conditions for GPS-based navigation in open area with an unobstructed view of the sky.The threshold time of ten seconds was selected based on the UAS community input.The data show that only 2 out of 118 campaign operations (1.7%) encountered loss of navigation.Since the campaign aircraft used GPS for navigation, it is likely that the unobstructed view of the sky at the campaign locations, described in Table 1, contributed to this small incidence of loss of navigation.It is expected that operations in areas where line of sight to GPS satellites can be easily blocked, such as an urban canyon, would experience an increase in loss of navigation if GPS is the sole means of navigation and the same formula is used to detect loss of navigation.To address this issue, for operations in urban area UA should be equipped with navigation systems that can rely on other sensors, such as Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) and radar, to cope with lost line of sight to GPS satellites.
B. Loss of Command and Control Link*** http://utmregistry.arc.nasa.gov/requires a credential from NASA to access.The C2 radio link RSSI measured at the aircraft in dBm, represented as a variable "c2RssiAircraft_dBm," is used to reflect the loss of C2 link.This off-nominal situation is detected when the RSSI remains at or below -90dBm for more than 10 seconds.A value of -90dBm is a typical radio-received sensitivity derived from UAS specifications.The data shows that 4 out of these 47 operations (8.5%) encountered actual loss of C2 link.This indicates that the communications systems used in the NC II, such as 900MHz and 2.4GHz radios, provided sufficient performance to cover relatively short distance between the GCS and aircraft, ranging from 2300 feet to 4200 feet.Also, unobstructed radio line of sight between UA and the GCS likely contributed to this small number of incidence of loss of C2 link.Data necessary to identify loss of C2 link situation was only received for 47 out of 118 operations (39.8%).This lack of data for the remaining 71 operations suggests that some operators may not be monitoring communications system performance during operation, may not be aware of which variables to monitor, or may be monitoring communications system performance with a variable different from the C2 RSSI received by the aircraft.To address the first two conditions, further engagement with the UAS operator community is needed to encourage communications system performance monitoring.To address the last condition, developing a de-facto standard to monitor communications systems is needed.
C. Contextual DataFrom the NC II, 15 non-duplicative reports of contextual data were received via online form in response to various events.Of these, 9 originated from the Remote-Control Pilot, 4 from the GCS Operator, 1 from a Mission Manager and 1 from a Flight Engineer.Table 2 provides Event Type and Counts.Note that multiple responses were permitted, thus respondents could provide more than 1 response to a single event; 4 reports represented more than 1 event type.Table 3 summarizes the Type of Loss of Control encountered.Table 4 summarizes the Action Taken and Result.Of the 14 contextual reports of off-nominal conditions that included wind-direction and speed data, only 3 were 10 knots or above, specifically 10, 11, and 12 knots, and all speed values were within the performance envelope of the associated UA.Therefore, wind velocity was not considered a significant factor in these incidents.Of the 13 reports providing density altitude data, 2 reports stated that density altitude was "unknown" and one report indicated density altitude in excess of 6,000 feet MSL.The remainder reported density altitude between 504 feet to 2696 feet.From this data, it was determined that density altitude did not play a significant role in precipitating off-nominal failures specified here.The distribution of events among aircraft types was unremarkable, and no question responses or categories indicated an unusual distribution of event or results.Due to the low number of reports, no significant trends emerged.With the small amount of available data, it is uncertain what might be potential underlying common contributors to off-nominal situations.The test team has identified a number of potential improvements to the report form to gain additional insights on failure conditions.For example, the future form will display different sets of questions to match operator role (Pilot in command, GCS operator, visual observer, etc.).Also, questions that were deemed too specific, such as the version of autopilot software and GCS software, will be removed.
V. ConclusionThe objective for the NASA-FAA UTM RTT C&N subgroup is to explore operator solutions to ensure that UA are under operational control of the pilot and remain within a defined area.To support this exploration, off-nominal operational situation data, both digital and contextual, were collected in one of the UTM flight test events in 2017, the NC II, which involved the six FAA UAS test sites.The collected data were analyzed to inform future data collection improvements and to reinforce operational compliance.Whereas loss of navigation and loss of C2 link off-nominal situations were investigated with the collected digital data, significant filtering effort were necessary to identify correct set of data for the analysis.In addition, due to the low number of contextual off-nominal reports from the NC II, no significant findings trends were identified.For future testing, connecting findings from the digital data to contextual data to further increase insights into off-nominal operational situations has been suggested by safety experts.To realize this connection, improved mechanisms to gather, filter and validate digital data is being developed.Also, changes will be made to the future contextual data collection form to improve the amount and quality of the information.The next application of these improved evaluations of UA off-nominal conditions is planned for the next National Campaign in early 2018.
