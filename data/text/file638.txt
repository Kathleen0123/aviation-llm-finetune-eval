[1, section V] for a comprehensive review and list of citations) has been to compute air traffic schedules, including those optimized to an objective function, using a model with the spatial variables being discrete (as opposed to successively refined discretizations of a model with continuous spatial variables).This trend can be traced to the introduction of the concept of time-based metering [13,14] for en-route air traffic that led to the development of the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) [15].Recent literature also documents attempts to research automation of terminal air traffic management using the discrete variable modeling approach.The two most prevalent approaches in the algorithms based on such models (see, e.g., Ref. [16], the references cited therein, and the research review in [1, section V]) are Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming (see, e.g., Ref. [17]).Almost all these efforts, however, are various attempts to model air traffic as a network flow [18] using an inherently discrete model.In algorithms based on such models, however, aircraft separation is enforced only at a finite number of airspace waypoints and runways, and hence have questionable applicability to the terminal airspace setting.Many of the solutions were obtained for problems concerning en-route (not terminal) air traffic and are, consequently, concerned primarily with traffic flow, assuming there is enough space to assure separation and conduct the necessary aircraft holding procedures to absorb delay.Some of these models rely on heuristics-based algorithms that are difficult to verify for correctness and to analyze for performance.The assumption of sufficient space, however, often fails in terminal airspace, and the complexity and incomplete understanding of an algorithm casts doubt on its applicability in real time.The more recent works, e.g.[9,4,5,8,6,19], have, by contrast, attempted to model the motion of the aircraft and to enforce separation continuously in time.These works, however, tend to run into the challenge of unrealistic computed speed profiles, which hinders executability in real time.The alternative of imposing sufficient constraints to obtain executable speed profiles, on the other hand, is hindered by the absence of uniform standards of aircraft performance and airport regulations, and is likely to increase the computational demand substantially, once again compromising real-time applicability.In summary, research experience suggests that, when pursuing the goals listed in Table 1, a modeling effort aimed at designing and deploying an automation system tends to become a tradeoff between combinatorial (i.e., growing factorially with problem size) complexity, model fidelity, and the degree to which the algorithms used are currently understood.The approach formulated in the present paper gives priority to operational safety (by assuring separation continuously in time) and executability, and yet achieves computational scalability to manage up to tens of aircraft.
III. The algorithmA. Input and outputX Y Altitude (X(s α ), Y (s α ), Alt(s α )) v α (s α )Figure 1: A projection of the route, and of a tangent velocity vector, onto the XY -coordinate (flat Earth) plane.The input to the algorithm consists of the following data:(i) An airspace region C, henceforth called the commitment region (for reasons explained below), that includes an airport or a metroplex.(ii) A sequence of aircraft, indexed α = 1, 2, . . ., A in the pre-determined order of entering the commitment region C. Entrance into C for a departing flight is defined as departing from an airport in C.Here A denotes the total number of flights.(iii) For each flight α, a route contained entirely in C, parameterized by the ground arc length s α of the route's projection onto the flat Earth (see Figure 1), and a ground speed profile v α (s α ) specified, with some margin of error, for that entire route and assumed to be sufficiently smooth to assure the existence of all the derivatives required in subsequent calculations.A notional illustration of the commitment region C is given in figure 2. The two routes shown are a departure (left) and an arrival (right).The airport or metroplex is shown as a hatched circle.The portion of each route contained in the commitment region is shown thicker than the route outside the region.The diameter of the region is on the scale of tens of NMI.The algorithm will apply to an integrated ATO; i.e., one that involves both arrivals and departures.A specific example in which the commitment region C is a circular cylinder of radius 60 NMI, with a the bottom base centered at the Los Angeles International Airport, is shown in Figure 3.The specification of s α , of v α (s α ), and of the time t 0 α at which flight α enters C at location s α = s 0 α completely determines the solution of the initial value problemds α dt = v α (s α ), s α t 0 α = s 0 α ,(1)airport or metroplex commitment region which describes the motion of the aircraft in C. Knowledge of this motion for each aircraft allows the computation of minimal required differences between two consecutive entrance times t 0 α1 , t 0 α2 required to assure that the two aircraft remain separated at all times while both are in C.This computation is described in detail in Section B. See, in particular, the notation t(α 2 , α 1 ), defined by the right-hand side of (5), for the minimal required time gap between aircraft α 1 , α 2 entering C, in that order, for these two aircraft to be separated at all times.The output of the algorithm is a sequence t 0 α , α = 1, 2, . . ., A, defined by the following recursion:t 0 α = max t 0 α-1 + t(α, α -1), t 0 α-2 + t(α, α -2), . . . , t 0 1 + t(α, 1) .(2)B. Computation of the minimal difference between consecutive entrance times From the ordinary differential equations in (1), one can compute, for each aircraft pair α 1 , α 2 , the region in the s α1 s α2 -coordinate plane consisting of all points (s α1 , s α2 ) that correspond to the two aircraft violating separation.This region will be denoted R(α 1 , α 2 ); see Figure 4. (For the details of this computation, see [4,5,6].)Furthermore, assuming aircraft α 1 enters C at time t = 0, and aircraft α 2 does so at a later time t > 0, one obtains a points α1 ( t), s α2 ( t)(3)in the s α1 s α2 -coordinate plane which can serve as the initial state for the systemd dt s α1 s α2 = v α1 (s α1 ) v α2 (s α2 ) .(4)Equation system (4) and state (3) together constitute an initial value problem (IVP) that, with certain smoothness assumptions on the ground speed profiles v(•), has a unique solution.(Figure 4 gives a notional illustration of such a solution.)One can therefore determine all such t that the solution (s α1 (t), s α1 (t)) t≥ t of the IVP never enters the interior of R(α 1 , α 2 ), i.e. corresponds to a separation-compliant motion of the aircraft pair.The minimal required value of t will be denoted by t(α 2 , α 1 ).It is computed herein using the following method.s α1 s α2 R (α 1 , α 2 ) (s α1 (t), s α1 (t)) s α1 ( t), s α2 ( t)Figure 4: A notional illustration of a phase curve (s α1 (t), s α1 (t)) that avoids the interior of the set R(α 1 , α 2 ) separation-violating states.Sample the trajectories of the two aircraft at pointss 0 α1 , s 1 α1 , s 2 α1 , . . . , s 0 α2 , s 1 α2 , s 2 α2 , . . . ,with every two consecutive points on a trajectory being some fixed distance, h, apart:s i+1 α1 -s i α1 = h, s j+1 α2 -s j α2 = h, i, j = 0, 1, . . . .For each pair s i α1 , s j α2 that corresponds to a violation of the separation requirement for the aircraft pair α 1 , α 2 , determine the corresponding times t i α1 , t j α2 :s α1 t i α1 = s i α1 , s α2 t j α2 = s j α2 .The value of t(α 2 , α 1 ) is chosen to be the largest of the differences t j α2 -t i α1 :t(α 2 , α 1 ) = max i,j t j α2 -t i α1(5)Because the execution of a ground speed profile always contains some error, analysis of sensitivity to such errors is carried out in Appendix A.
IV. Methods
A. Dates and time windowsIn the sample solutions shown here, the commitment region C was taken to be a circular cylinder, with the lower base centered at the indicated airport, of radius 60 NMI.The input data are recordings of the actual radar tracks in the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) [14].The two airports for which data are shown in the figures below are Charlotte Douglas International (CLT) and Los Angeles International (LAX).Each figure showing a data plot is accompanied by a specification (printed above the plots) of the airport and the time window during which the traffic was recorded.For LAX, the algorithm described in Section III was tested using traffic recording data from July 3 through 5 of 2014.To compare the traffic behavior to that on a date away from a holiday, an analogous test was run on traffic data recorded July 18, 2014.For Charlotte Douglas International (CLT) and Atlanta International (ATL), the algorithm was tested on traffic data from November 27 through 29 (Nov.28 was the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday).To compare the traffic behavior to that on a date away from a holiday, an analogous test was run on traffic data recorded on November 20, 2013.On each date, the data were chosen from a midday window, in an attempt to capture a typical traffic density (that has time to build up since early morning) and typical flight conditions (daylight).
B. Data collection methodFor each of a number of dates in 2013 and 2014, a collection of 50 flights recorded in the track data entered the commitment region during the specified time window.The flights were sampled in the order of entering the commitment region.The flights in which the altitude was not a monotonically increasing or decreasing function of time (i.e., flights that were not a clear arrival and not a clear departure) and did not reach both the airport and the boundary of the commitment region were discarded.(The monotonicity was measured as statistical correlation between the recorded trajectory and a theoretical linear trajectory.)A failure to classify the flight as either a departure or an arrival using this method has several possible explanations in terms of actual operations.One explanation is that the flight experienced a missed approach.Another is that radar track data on the same flight collected by different radars, or collected past the landing moment of an arriving flight, may contain spurious artifacts (e.g., poor alignment between the track hits).The sampling continued until the total number of flights reached 50.The number of flights that ended up being discarded in this process is given in each figure's top section.All the times of entry into the commitment region, both actual and computed, are given in offset UNIX time recorded in the CTAS file.The time is the number of seconds elapsed since a time instant specific to the operation on that date.
C. How the algorithm was tested on dataIn the analysis carried out, each flight's path and speed profile, as recorded in the CTAS, was assumed to coincide with the flight's (actually unknown) intent.For these assumed intents, the algorithm described in Section III was run to compute the minimally spaced separation-compliant times of entering the commitment region, with the first flight entering at the time recorded in the data.The runway separation standards (for in-trail pairs of flights arriving on the same runway) assumed in the algorithm are listed in Table 2.The values in the table were used with scalings described in Section D.
D. Sources of errorIn cases when two flights consecutively arrived on the same runway, the separation standards (given in NMI) listed in Table 2 were used in the computation.For LAX and ATL, enforcement in the algorithm of the standards listed in Table 2 for every pair of in-trail arrivals on the same runway (indicated, perhaps with some error, in the CTAS data) yielded makespans a substantially greater than those recorded live.In the opinion of the authors, as well as of the author of [20] and other SMEs, this is explained by the predominance of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) Approach [20] landings in daylight, which results in separations substantially smaller than those prescribed by the standards in Table 2. To explore this possibility, for LAX and ATL, the algorithm was run, for each of these airports and for each date near or on a holiday, with runway separation standards (see the value 'RWY sep.frac.' in the figure legends) ranging over the following values:• 1.0× those in Table 2 • 0.75× those in Table 2 • 0.5× those in Table 2 Another source of error is the inaccuracy, in the recorded data, of the data field specifying the flight's arrival runway.The runways specified are the best inference that could be made by the software [14] from the data available about the flight (e.g., the flight plan and subsequent amendments to it).Because some of these values exceed the minima required at some of the runways, and because some consecutive arrivals on the same runway are visual approaches [20], some of the computed time gaps t(α 2 , α 1 ) are expected to exceed those recorded in the actual operations.This is, indeed, so for most of the cases presented.
V. ResultsTable 3 gives a summary of the average delays per flight introduced by the algorithm for the dates and time windows specified in Section IV.This summary suggests the statements listed next: a The makespan of an ATO is the total duration of the operation.3 exhibit the following patterns:• At LAX, on non-holiday dates, the average delay per flight introduced by the algorithm at full scale runway separation was at least 1, 100 seconds (∼ 18 minutes).• At ATL, on non-holiday dates, the average delay per flight introduced by the algorithm at full scale runway separation was at least 963 seconds (∼ 16 minutes).Since the algorithm assumes minimal separation (in particular, at the runway), it follows from these patterns that most of the arrivals at LAX and ATL were carried out at separations considerably less than those in the separation matrix in Table 2.This is known to occur widely in practice under VFR [20] and is consistent with the fact that the actual operations were carried out during daylight.(ii) At LAX and ATL, the average delay per flight introduced by the algorithm appears significantly less on the holiday than on the other days.Items (i) and (ii) are interpreted collectively at the end of this section.(iii) At LAX, the average delay introduced by the algorithm exhibits no apparent dependence on the ratio of departures to arrivals within the sample.Specifically, for the computations with the runway separation enforced at full scale, 1.0, the relevant data from Table 3 are reproduced in Table 4.The statistical correlation coefficient between the latter two rows of numerical data in Table 4 is 0.21341 (weak positive).(iv) At ATL, the average delay introduced by the algorithm appears somewhat to depend on the ratio of departures to arrivals within the sample.Specifically, for the computations with the runway separation enforced at full scale, 1.0, the relevant data from Table 3 are reproduced in Table 5.The statistical correlation coefficient between the latter two rows of numerical data in Table 5 is 0.94960.Although such a value of the correlation coefficient is generally considered strong, it is based in this case on limited data and cannot serve as convincing evidence of an interdependence.The phenomenological difference between LAX and ATL outlined in statements (iii) and (iv) may be caused by the difference in route network topology, traffic patterns, and ATO practices between the two airports.(v) At CLT, the average delay per flight introduced by the algorithm for runway separation scale 1.0 ranged from 142.6 to 221.1 seconds (approximately from 2.4 to 3.7 minutes).A delay on the order of minutes is not significant in the sense that it is at least one order of magnitude less than the duration of even a short fight.Consequently, the data indicate that the actual flights proceeded at separation standards close to those in Table 2.A possible explanation for the phenomena for statements (i) and (ii) is that air travel subsides on the day of the holiday, as most passengers have already arrived at their holiday destination and are not yet departing.Evidentiary support for this explanation can be seen in Table 6.The Table shows the total operation counts at the airport, taken on the same day of the week in: the holiday week, the four weeks immediately preceding the holiday, and the week following the holiday.At each of the examined three airports (LAX, ATL, CLT), the operational count on the day of the holiday is substantially lower than those in the other weeks on the same day of the week.
VI. Conclusions and Future WorkThe algorithm presented in Section III is aimed at addressing aircraft separation for a collective of aircraft in flight within a given zone (comparable in size with the terminal airspace).A key assumption is that the flights have been sequenced and routed.Each flight is to commit to a speed profile provided by the flight's FMS.The output of the algorithm can be corrected for perturbations to the execution of the speed profile and to departure times using the methodology described in Appendix A. The main goal of the algorithm is to provide automated support for separation assurance that, according to the FAA requirements, must be maintained continuously at all times.Numerical experiments, described in Section IV and summarized in Section V, suggest that the current implementation of the algorithm succeeds at keeping the aircraft separated according to the required standards.At the same time, the numerical evidence indicates that the algorithm generally introduces excess separation (resulting in flight delay).This delay can be reduced or removed by modeling more accurately the separation practices for separating arriving aircraft at the runway.The dependence of the amount of this excess delay on the ratio of departures to arrivals within a given operation cannot, in the authors' opinion, be clearly characterized from the above results and requires further research.In the above algorithm, the sequence in which the flights enter the commitment zone was assumed given.If the sequence is not given and must be computed as part of the algorithm, then the problem (regarding the flights as the nodes, and the time separations t as distances) becomes an Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem [21], further complicated by two circumstances: the distances may not conform to the triangle inequality, and the possibility of multiple flights lined up on the same route impose additional constraints, known in the literature as precedence constraints [12].Among the possible directions of further research are: methods of addressing the sources of error described in Section IV.D, a refinement of the separation requirements to remove the excessive excessive constraints and obtain more accurate estimates of delay, and a number of computations in which the intended speed profiles are perturbed, leading to a need to run the algorithm again.Consideration of how the algorithm, when refined for use in the field, might be implemented highlights two requirements in data communication.One is that the computer on which the algorithm is run must be able to receive sufficiently early the intent (computed by the FMS) of all the aircraft involved.The second requirement is that the times of entry into the commitment zone, when they have been computed, must be conveyed to the corresponding flights.Only one numerical value per flight need be broadcast.The computed expression for the correction of t (2) for the perturbation (s) gives time buffers by which one may wish to "pad" the time separations t in (2).A way to correct also for perturbations to the departure times is to introduced an additive error term to the righthand side of equation ( 6) in the Appendix: t (2), -t (1) = s (2)   s (1)   ds v(s) + (s) + (error in the departure time for that flight), which gives the worst-case bound t (2), -t (1) ≤ s (2)   s (1)   ds v(s) + (s) + (upper bound on the error in the departure time for that flight).Figure 2 :2Figure 2: A notional illustration of a commitment region, shown here as a cylinder with one base on the approximately flat Earth surface.

A. Sensitivity to perturbations of the speed profile and of the departure times Suppose an aircraft is to fly along its route with arc length coordinate s.In general, the ground speed profile v(s) to which that aircraft is committed in region C is not executable exactly, but will rather experience perturbations (e.g., caused by the wind).If (s) denotes the perturbation (e.g., caused by wind) to the aircraft's execution of the speed profile v(s) at position s, then the kinematic equation describing the motion of the aircraft along its route isThe question central to this Appendix is as follows: if the aircraft starts in position s (1) at time t (1) and in the absence of perturbations ( ≡ 0) reaches position s (2) at time t (2) , how will the perturbation (s) affect the time t (2) (changing it to a time t (2), ) of reaching position s (2) ?To answer this question, solve the latter differential equation for dt and integrate from t (1) to t (2) for the unperturbed case,t (1)   dt = s (2)   s (1)   ds v(s) ,and also for the perturbed case,s (1)The above question asks what the difference is between t (2), and t (2) .An exact expression for this difference will now be obtained in terms of the difference between the integrands on the right-hand sides of the latter two equations.Expand the latter integrand in powers of (x):Consequently, the difference between the integrands 1/(v(s) + (s)) and 1/v(s) isand the change in t (2) that results from the perturbation iss (1)   -(s) v(s) 2 + (s) 2 v(s) 3 + higher powers of (s) ds.If the absolute perturbation | (s)| is at every s smaller than |v(s)| b (thus guaranteeing convergence of the power series), then the latter expression in square brackets can be bounded using the following facts from calculus:• In the special case (s)  v(s) > 0, the power series • In the general case, the approximation error for the M -th partial sum equalswhere the last equality follows from the formula for the sum of a convergent geometric series.b The precise statement would be | (s)/v(s)| ≤ (some constant independent of s) < 1 for all s.
