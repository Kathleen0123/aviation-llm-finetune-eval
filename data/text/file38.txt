I IntroductionThis document describes a Matlab 1 program to smooth radar position data from flights in the National Airspace System (NAS).The data come from Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) sources.The TRACON source is given priority over the ARTCC source: where there is overlap (usually below 20,000 ft), TRACON tracks are used.Each Center track record contains nominal 12-sec samples; each Terminal record has nominal 4.8-sec samples.Both record sources contain dropouts and wild points, although TRACON tracks have less uncertainty.Each track record comprises time-tagged values of aircraft position (x, y in stereographic coordinates), Mode-C altitude, and real-time filter estimates of ground speed, ground track, and climb rate.The filter estimates are error-prone and can have a lag of 60 sec.Smoothing of the track records reduces wild-point errors and interpolates through data dropouts, and because it is an off-line process, it provides lag-free estimates of ground speed and ground track.Smoothed tracks can simulate the data stream down-linked from aircraft equipped with an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system.The ADS-B stream includes GPS-derived position, ground speed, ground track, and Mode-S altitude information.The advantage of GPS tracking is that it provides position accuracy at least an order of magnitude better than ARTCC radar tracking, and with a sample rate of 1 Hz, accurate and nearly lag-free estimates of ground speed and ground track.Currently, less than 20% of commercial aircraft are ADS-B equipped, and full implementation is not mandated until 2020. 2 The smoothing code was written to support testing of TSAFE [3][4][5] (Tactical Separation-Assured Flight Environment) in a simulated ADS-B environment.TSAFE is intended to handle air-traffic conflicts left unresolved when loss-of-separation is predicted to occur within approximately two minutes.Radar-derived track records are an essential part of each standard TSAFE input file. 6hen those tracks become available from an ADS-B source, it is expected that TSAFE conflict prediction and resolution will be improved.Until full ADS-B implementation is available, however, smoothing radar data should provide reasonably accurate and lag-free track estimates for testing TSAFE in an ADS-B-like environment.Recently, access to a 42-day (03/04/2013 -04/16/2013) data base consisting of NAS-wide aircraft flight and ground traffic data was made available through the NASA Data Warehouse. 7These data include some from flights equipped to downlink ADS-B tracks.This made it possible to find flights in the data base that could be used to compare results of smoothed-radar and GPS-derived tracks.There are two versions of the smoothing code: one is a batch version called batchSmooth, used to smooth all track records in a data file (there may be several thousand flights included).A second version provides printed output including plots, and is used for code testing or when a detailed analysis of a single flight is required.This version, called smoothTracks, can also be used in batch mode.The basic algorithms are common to both versions.The algorithms are outlined next in Section II.More information on the core smoothing algorithms is covered in Appendix B. Section III describes how to use the program and Section IV presents an example of the smoothing procedure for a single flight.This flight was included in the ADS-B data base, and was used to compare radar position smoothing and ADS-B tracking shown in Section V.
II AlgorithmsThe radar tracking data sent to TSAFE is derived from Center radar (nominal 12-sec update) and Terminal radar (nominal 4.8-sec update).The track data consist of North and East position records (in a stereographic coordinate system), and pressure altitude (from an onboard transponder).The position and altitude records are non-periodic because the radar "hit" rate varies from the nominal.In addition, there will be data dropouts and gaps where wild points have been removed.The basic tasks performed by the software described in this document are smoothing, wild-point removal and interpolation to a common time base, and smoothing of the interpolated records.The tasks are summarized in this section, starting with a review of the smoothing algorithm.
SmoothingHere smoothing is done by sliding a cubic polynomial, fit to an odd number of consecutive data points (narc), through a record zR of length npts, taking each "interior" center point as the smoothed estimate. 8There are a number of ways to handle boundary requirements.Perhaps the simplest is to use as boundary-segment estimates the first (narc+1)/2 points of the first narc-point cubic fit to zR, and the last (narc+1)/2 points of the last narc-point fit to zR.Then, smoothed estimates of the interior portion from point (narc+1)/2 to point npts-(narc+1)/2 are obtained, point by point, by sliding the cubic arc from starting point 2 to ending point npts -1, taking the center point of each fit to complete the smoothed record.The procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 by a moving arc fit with narc = 5 points.For the interior points, only the center point of each fit contributes to the smoothed record.
Wild-Point Removal and InterpolationSince the smoothing program has been designed for use in "batch" mode, a simple statistical test is used to identify wild points.A smoothing pass is made on each raw position record, and the mean and standard deviation computed for the error sequence (defined as the difference between the smoothed and raw records at each time point).If a point in the error sequence is outside of three standard deviations, it is considered a wild point, and the corresponding point in the raw record is removed.Following wild-point removal in position and altitude records, another smoothing pass is made on each (non-periodic) record.The smoothed representation is used to compute periodic samples at exactly 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 sec.The period is chosen by the user (the default value is 6 sec).The default number of arc points narcD for raw-data smoothing has been chosen to reasonably capture the aircraft dynamics from a nominal 12-sec Center radar "sweep" rate.Since terminal radar data (with a 4.8-sec sweep) are included in the track records, a default arc length will be replaced by narcR = (nearest odd integer) > (12/avgPer)*narcD where narcR is the number of arc points used to smooth a raw record, and avgPer is the average period of the raw record.
Smoothing of Interpolated RecordsTwo smoothing passes are made on each interpolated record.Following this, the number of arc points is adjusted again, to the value narcI = (nearest odd integer) > (avgPer/hFin)*narcR where narcI is the number of arc points used to smooth an interpolated record and hFin is the user-chosen sample period.After processing of all records, the climb rate, ground speed, and ground track are computed from time-derivative estimates provided by the smoothing algorithm.In the version smoothTracks, there is also a "single-run" mode, which has screen output and plots to show how the smoothing process works and to facilitate debugging.
III Using the Smoothing ProgramTo set up the smoothing program, in your home directory create a directory called "matlab" containing a file called "startup.m"that contains one line: addpath path_to_smoothing_algorithm_directory All the smoothing algorithms should reside in this directory. 9In the directory chosen to run Matlab there should be a TSAFE input file called TSAFE.in.unsmoothed (see section IV).To run smoothTracks (or batchSmooth) from this directory give the command matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -r smoothTracks (or batchSmooth) to smooth the track data.In batch mode, a new file called TSAFE.in.smoothed will be created which will be the same as TSAFE.in.unsmoothed, except that smoothed tracks will replace the original raw track records.Note: All routines mentioned in this section and the next are described in Appendix B.
Running smoothTracksThis version of the smoothing code is interactive.It can provide screen output, including plots that are useful for code testing or when a detailed analysis of a flight is required.It also can be used in batch mode.When the Matlab call to run smoothTracks is given, the following screen output appears:The TSAFE input file to be read is TSAFE.in.unsmoothedIf other than a default value is desired, respond to the prompt by entering the value.Recall that the default arc points for altitude (h) and plan-view (x-y) smoothing have been chosen to match the nominal 12-sec Center radar "sweep" rate.Note: A smoothing parameter nm is related to the arc length narc by nm = (narc -1)/2.Next, the routine getACIDList determines a list of unique aircraft call signs by parsing the input file for lines beginning with "FLT."These flight records correspond to the filed flight plans and provide basic information about the flight, such as cruise altitude and airspeed, aircraft type, and equipage.After the list has been created, the screen output is, for example, There are 5648 call signs contained in the flight records Note: Not all unique call signs will have track records that are "smoothable."Some aircraft may never have departed; some may never rise above minAlt (only records with altitude above that level are included), or the record length may contain fewer points than the longest arc.Now the user can choose the flights whose tracks are to be smoothed.Usually the choice would be either one or all, although any number from one to all may be chosen.If and only if one flight is chosen, extended screen output, including plots, is displayed.This can help answer questions about a solution or test a code modification.The user will be given a series of prompts.As an example, consider the following sequence of prompts, each followed by a typical user response for purposes of illustration:For a single call sign, enter it within single quotes: 'AAL1225/KDFW' For a single run there will be a prompt to have plots printed:
Enter one to have plots printed: 1The complete output for a single smoothing run is presented in a later section.On the other hand, if it desired to select a range of flights and to store results in TSAFE.in.smoothed, the prompts will be
Enter indices for a range of smoothing runs [m1 m2]: [1 5648]Enter one to store smoothing results: 1Here the screen output will beThe smoothed tracks will be stored in TSAFE.in.smoothedIn this example all runs have been selected for smoothing and the results are to be stored.Since the number of flights chosen is greater than 1, the only screen output for each smoothing run is, for example, Working on run: 127 AAL1225/KDFW After all processing has been completed, a screen message will appear that indicates what fraction of the track records have been smoothed:Flight track records that have been smoothed: 4194/5648 Note: Not every track record could be smoothed.In this case, records for 4194 call signs will have been smoothed.Finally, following the creation of file TSAFE.in.smoothed, this message will appear:Smoothed track records that have been stored: 4194
Running batchSmoothThis batch version of the smoother is not interactive.The default parameter values are used.(For other than default values, smoothTracks can be used in batch mode.)All flight track data will be smoothed and stored in the file TSAFE.in.smoothed.Once the call to Matlab to run batchSmooth is given, the only screen output (for the same input file used in the last example) is
IV A Smoothing ExampleWith access to a data base consisting of NAS-wide air-traffic data that includes some downlinked ADS-B tracking data, it became feasible to find flights that had both radar and ADS-B track sources.A search was made for such flights in the ZFW Center during a four-hour period on the day 03/24/2013.In that period, there were a total of 1480 flights; only 106 of these flights were equipped with ADS-B.One of those flights, AAL1847, is presented in this section as an example of smoothing radar track data.The track source was the ZFW ARTCC and TRACON.A comparison of the smoothed-radar and GPS-derived tracks is shown in the next section.The example presented here is a single smoothing run interaction with the user, with screen output, including plots.It was obtained by calling Matlab with the command The routine removeAltJumps analyzes cruise portions by determining patches of constant altitude and looking for discrete "jumps" in altitude before and after each patch.A patch is defined to have a minimum of 7 consecutive points at the same altitude.This procedure is useful for removing artifacts in the smoothed record.For this flight, no jumps were found in the Mode-C record.Next, the routine procTRKData performs wildpointing, interpolation, and smoothing of altitude, x (East), and y (North) tracks for each aircraft's raw radar data record.Because of terminal track hits (at 4.8 sec) during the last part of descent from cruise, the average period is 9.4 sec.The smoothing parameters for wildpointing will be nmh = 3 and nmp = 5.The following output shows wild-pointing results provided by routines findStatWP_H and findStatWP_XY: After wildpointing a record, the routine interpRec interpolates to 6-sec samples, and the smoothing parameters are adjusted once again, to nmh = 3 and nmp = 6.Next, two smoothing passes are made (each by the routine smoothPass, which is called by the routine smoothTRKRec) on the altitude and planview (x, y) records.This produces the following screen output:Working on corrected AAL1847/KBOS Alt record:Smoothing Pass 1: timI(1) = -0.0;timI(278) = 1662.0Fit on pass 1 of AAL1847/KBOS Alt record:derivative estimates).Notice that the velocities are less noisy during the terminal-radar portion of the altitude tracks.
V Comparison of Smoothed and ADS-B TracksThe ADS-B-equipped flight AAL1847/KBOS was found within the time window of the data base available through the NASA Data Warehouse.Each ADS-B track consists of GPS position, GPS-derived ground speed and ground track, and Mode-S altitude.Although the downlink rate is nominally 1 Hz, the data base contains only every 5 th track sample, which is still adequate to compare GPS ground speed and ground track with the smoothed radar estimates.The AAL1847 ADS-B tracks were accessed and a common time interval was determined for radar and ABS-B track records.The code written to perform these tasks is not included in the smoothing "Core Routines" described in the Appendix.The screen output of the GPS-derived track acquisition is:  and7: the planview (x-y) in Figure 6, the altitude in Figure 7.While there were no jumps in the cruise portions of the Mode-C raw altitude shown in Figure 3, jumps did occur in the ADS-B Mode-S record.Appendix B describes the routine removeAltJumps that addresses discretization problems.Jump-removal results are shown for the Mode-S data in Figure 8.Note that nJ = 59 is the count of 25-ft jump corrections.Note also that the altitude plots shown in Figure 7 seem to deviate below 18000 ft.Perhaps the Mode-S altitude was not corrected for terminal-area pressure conditions.ADS-BA comparison of smoothed radar and ADS-B ground speed is shown Figure 9, and of ground track in Figure 10.While the position records match each other quite closely, the velocity records are not quite as close a match.Artifacts in the smoothing of (mostly) nominal 12-sec radar position are probably responsible.However, there is no delay in the smoothed velocity estimates.There was no information about climb rate in the data base, although climb rate is available from the on-board GPS receiver.It was mentioned earlier that radar records available to TSAFE include real-time filtered estimates of ground speed and ground track.These estimates, especially those derived from ARTCC radar, are generally not accurate and show unacceptable lag for use with a tactical conflict-resolution tool.This can be observed by comparing the filtered radar and ADS-B velocities, as shown in Figures 11 and12.The lag in the Center portion of filtered ground track shown is seen to be greater than 36 sec (3 samples).Finally, the results shown in this example are typical of those observed in other flights taken from the sample that had both radar and GPS tracking.It will be interesting to determine if the accuracy and high sample rate of GPS tracking leads to the expected improved ability for TSAFE to detect and resolve aircraft conflicts.
VI Concluding RemarksThis document has described a program for smoothing NAS radar data to simulate tracking data downloaded from an ADS-B equipped aircraft.The purpose was to provide a track-data source for testing TSAFE in an ADS-B environment.A comparison of smoothed and GPS-derived tracking data showing the correspondence between aircraft ground speed and ground track estimates has been presented.It should be emphasized that the smoothing code described here is quite modular and could be readily adapted for other applications that require smoothing of radar-track data.GetRateEstimates uses time derivatives xDot, yDot, and hDot to calculate estimates of ground speed (kt), ground track (deg), and climb rate (ft/min).Called by procTRKData.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.Moving-arc least-square fit to 5 points: x = raw; o = fit.

smoothPass does "moving-arc" (cubic) smoothing.The nm+1 points at the start and end of a record are determined by fitting a cubic to the first and last narc = 2*nm+1 points.Interior points are determined, one by one, as the center of each narc-point cubic moved through the record.Called by checkRecForWPs.cubicFit fits a cubic to the narc point array Zp at time points in the array Tp.The center point of the fit and time derivative are returned, unless Tp contains the first or last narc points.In those two cases, the first and last nm+1 points of the fit, respectively, are returned.Called by smoothPass.removeWPs removes the wild points in records x, y, and altitude found by checkRecForWPs.Called by findStatWP_XY or findStatWP_H.interpRec does "moving-arc" (cubic) smoothing as in smoothPass on the wild-pointed record and provides interpolants of period hFin to span the record.Called by findStatWP_XY or findStatWP_H.cubicFitInt fits a cubic to the narc point array Zp at time points in the array Tp.The points returned are interpolants of period hFin for times less than or equal to the rounded value of the center point of the Tp array, until Tp contains the last narc points.Then the points returned are interpolants for times less than or equal to the rounded value of the last point of the array.Called by interpRec.smoothTRKRec controls the smoothing of each x, y, and altitude record that earlier was wild-pointed and interpolated to hFin seconds.There are two passes performed to provide a smoothed estimate and its time derivative.Called by procTRKData.smoothPass: see earlier description for this routine.Called by smoothTRKRec.cubicFit: see earlier description for this routine.Called by smoothPass.
removeAltJumps removes jumps in raw altitude during cruise associated with altimeter discretization (usually 100 ft).Their removal enhances altitude smoothing without compromising conflict detection.Called by getRawTRKData.these routines apply a statistical test to identify and remove wild points from the raw records.Wild points in x and y tracks are assumed to be correlated, as they are derived from radar returns.The aircraft altitude record is derived from a Mode-C or Mode-S transponder, and, for wildpointing, is considered separately from the x-y records.Called by procTRKData.checkRecForWPs smoothes a single raw record and applies a three standard-deviation error limit to identify wildpoints.Called by findStatWP_XY or findStatWP_H.findDiscretLevels determines the altitude discretization level (default 100 ft). Called byremoveAltJumps.procTRKData performs wildpointing, interpolation, and smoothing of altitude, x (East), and y(North) tracks for one aircraft raw radar data record with nominal 12-sec and 4.8-sec samples,and calculates altitude rate, ground speed, and ground track.

Appendix B Core RoutinesThere are two Matlab programs that generate smoothed x, y, and altitude records from TSAFE radar tracks.The first, batchSmooth, works only in "batch" mode: it reads track records from file TSAFE.in.unsmoothed, smoothes the track data, replaces the original tracks, and stores the new file in file TSAFE.in.smoothed.There is very limited screen output and no plots are provided.The second program, smoothTracks, allows the user to specify the aircraft whose tracks are to be smoothed.This program can also be used in batch mode.However, if a single aircraft is selected, screen and printed output (including plots) are provided.This mode is useful for analyzing a particular case and for code debugging.Both batchSmooth and smoothTracks utilize the same core routines.These are described below, in the order in which they are called.getACIDList reads flight registration messages 6 from TSAFE.in.smoothed.These correspond to filed flight plans.An example of the format required is given by FLT 1341581430 AAL1225/KDFW MD82/Q IFR RVSM DEP 320 454Here fields 2 and 3 are the record timestamp and the call sign of the flight to which it applies.Field 4 gives the FAA aircraft type designation.Field 5 indicates the filing status of the flight as IFR (Instrument Flight Rules).Field 6 indicates that the aircraft is equipped for RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum).Field 7 is the ATC type, in this case "departure".Fields 8 and 9 are the filed altitude in units of 100 feet and the filed airspeed in knots.The routine keys on "FLT" and compiles a list of unique aircraft call signs that will be used to access track data.getACIDList is called by batchSmooth and smoothTracks.getRawTRKData reads track messages 6 for a given call sign.Each message provides time, x, y, altitude, ground speed, ground track, and sector.An example of the format required is
