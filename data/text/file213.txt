Terminal-Area Traffic Management SystemThe flow diagram in Fig. 1 outlines a concept for a terminal-area traffic management system.Our a~tention here is directed to the major information~~rocessing and information transfer elements.A" key element is the scheduler.which generates the landing order and desired touchdown times for all aircraft entering the terminal control area.Primary inputs to the scheduler are the list of arriving aircraft and their estimated times of arrival at the entry points into the terminal area.In generating landing times, the scheduler considers.among other factors.the interaircraft separation rules.the type of aircraft, the type of equipment onboard an aircraft, and the scheduling protocol.For example.two consecutively scheduled aircraft equipped with 4D guidance may be scheduled closer to the minimum allowed time-separation than two consecutively scheduled unequipped aircraft.A human operator will monitor the scheduljng operations on a graphics terminal and when necessary overrule the here is its role in helping to increase the efficiency of air traffic control.The design of onboard systems that achieve accurate time-control in critical air-traffic-control situations, such as descent and landing approaches, is a complex process involving the definition of efficient trajectory algorithms and their integration with various guidance, control, and navigation subsystems.Design techniques for such systems have been developed primarily by NASA over the past several years.A number of designs have been implemented and evaluated in flight tests.These tests , although not yet complete, have demonstrated that the performance goal of an arrival time accuracy of zlO sec after a 30-min flight is achievable.3,Ĩn the design implemented at Ames Research Center, 4D guidance is carried out in two distinct steps.The first, referred to as fast-time synthesis, establishes the 40 reference trajectory between the initial and final positions of the aircraft.In terminal-area air-trafficcontrol applications, the initial position is chosen at a point a few miles before the aircraft begins descent from cruise altitude, typically 120 n. mi.from touchdown.Fast-time synthesis is performed when the aircraft receives the touchdowntime clearance from ATC; it is completed in less than one hundredth of the real-time duration of the trajectory.A synthesis is successful if the resulting trajectory achieves the specified touchdown time and obeys all critical operational and performance constraints.If the synthesis fails, an error message is displayed to the human operator (pilot or controller).The successfully synthesized trajectory is stored and then regenerated in synchronism with real time.sThe second step in 40 guidance is ~o implement a technique for tracking the reference trajectory.In an onboard implementation, the altitude rate, heading rate, and speed-hold autopilot modes, combined with position sensors, such as provided by an area navigation system, offer the means for closed-loop tracking of th~reference trajectory.The design of the required feedback laws is accomplished by application of conventional flight-control design techniques and is not further discussed in this paper.However, a different and more complex situation arises if the 4D trajectory is computed for an unequipped aircraft in the ground-based ATC computers.Then the controller must convey tracking information to the pilot by the standard voice communication link .Clearly, conventional feedback control theory is not applicable here.An approach to solving this problem will be described in a later section.Whether implemented on the ground or in the air, all 40 guidance systems depend.critically on accurate wind-profile information in order to achieve the desired arrival time accuracy.In principle, ground-based computers can maintain wind-profile models which are periodically updated using various measurement sources, such as weather balloons or aircraft equipped with inertial guidance systems.When the mode-S transponders become 40 Guidance Techniques Time-control, or 4D guidance, is the technique of controlling the trajectory of an aircraft to arrive at a specified location at a sp ec ified time.There are many civil and military appl ications of this idea, but the one at issue scheduler's decision processes using special comma nd inputs.For example, the controller may ch ange the built-in scheduling protocol, such as fi r s t come first served, to accommodate an emerge ncy landing request.An interactive scheduling s ystem with these general features is being developed at Ames Research Center.Analytical t echniques relevant to its des ign are discussed i n Re f. 2.The landing times generated by the scheduler are handled in one of two ways, depending on whether they apply to a 40-equipped aircraft or unequipped aircraft.For 40-equipped aircraft, they are uplinked automatically ' and translated .i nt o 40 guidance commands by the onboard flightmanagement system.Closed-loop tracking together with accurate navigation ensure that the ~O-equippcd aircraft will meet the scheduled landing times with high accuracy.Onboard algorithms for generating 40 trajectories are described in the next section of this paper.Landing times and radar tracking data for ' unequi pped aircraft are processed in the 4D-profile generator resident in the ATC host computer.The 40-profile generate calculates advisory messages and displays them on a controller display.They are intended to help the controller maintain landing time-schedules of the unequipped aircraft.The controller issues these messages to the pilot whenever time-errors become excessive.The content of the advisory messages and an algorithm for calculating them are discussed in a later section.

Trajectory Synthesis AlgorithmAlthough 40 guidance system design presents many interesting problems, the most novel and least understood of them is the definition • of the 40 trajectory algorithm.Two technical approaches for deriving such algorithms are reviewed here.One is based on optimal control theory, the other on modeling of typical pilot procedures, referred to as the procedural synthesis method.They are intended for onboard and ground implementation, respectively.r = j v 2 gmaxj g tan <P ma x (1)Whatever technical approach is used, the synthesis problem involves generating a continuous state vector function of time, X(t).from an ~rbitrary but known initial-time state vector Xi ; (xi~Yi.hi' ~i' vi) to a final-time state vector Xf ~(xf' Yf. hf, ~f' vf) with final time tf specified.The components of the state vector are the two Cartesian pos~tion coordinates, the altitude, th~heading.and the airspeed, respectively.Between the initial-and final-state vectors.a set of n way-points, Xj ; (x', y', hi' Wj' Vj)' 1 ~j ~n, are used to specify aJcomplex approach rate.*The trajectory must pass through these way-point states in subscript order.Not all of the components of the way-point state vector need be specified.In general, the fewer the number of specified way-points and their components, the greater is the freedom to optimize the trajectory for fuel or cost efficiency.That portion of the tEajectory beginning at Xl and terminating at X f is referred to as the stan-~ard.orfixed route .The trajectory from Xi to Xl 1S known as the capture trajectory and plays an important role in the development of general 40 trajectory synthesis procedures.Algorithms for both capture-and fixed-route trajectory synthesis are described in Refs. 3 and 5.A crucial simplification in deriving practical algorithms for both the optimal and procedural approaches is to separate the synthesis into two essentially independent problems that are solved sequentially.The first problem is to synthesize the horizontal plane (two-dimensional) trajectory between initial and final points, using simple geometric patterns such as circular arcs and straight-line segments.Using these patterns, a continuous path without discontinuous heading changes must be constructed to traverse between (Xi' Yi) and (xf' yf) while passing through all intermediate way-point coordinates (Xj~YjL' Furt~ermore, the path directions at Xi' Xf' and the Xj's must satisfy the specified heading values ~i' Wf' and the Wj'S, respectively.The turn radii for the circular segments at the various way-points are computed from the relation *Note that X -X- After the horizontal-plane trajectory has been synthesized, the curvilinear distance along £he trajectory, df' measured as distance-to-go to X f, can be chosen as the distance variable for the setond step in solving the synthesis problem.This ~the problem of defining the airspeed and altitude profiles along the curvilinear hori~ontal-plane trajectory so as to achieve h f and v[ at the final time, tf.It is for this step of the process that two methods of synthesis, namely the optimal control and the procedural methods, will be described.n - f' 168 RUNWAY FIXED TRAJECTORY <,
Optimal Control MethodThis method of synthesis depends on specifyi ng a scalar performance criterion and equations of motion given in the form of a set of differential equations.For airline operations, the criterion of greatest interest is the total cost J, of a flight, defined as the sum of fuel cost and time cost,J (2) J (6)where C f is unit cost of fuel, Wf the total fuel consumed, and C t the unit cost of time.The equations of motion chosen here are a highly simplified set known as the energy state model.Although it is simple, this model has been found to be adequate for generating flyable trajectories in airline applications. 7The two differential equations of the model are"fwhere E = h + (1/2g)v 2 is known as the specific energy, and x is now interpreted as the~dis tance along the curvilinear ground track.Other quantities in Eqs , (3) and ( 4) are the thrust T. the drag D, the aircraft weight W, the airspeed v, the ground speed v , and the acceleration of gravity g.The algegraic constraint that lift equal weight (L = W) is also assumed.
d(x+ x d )/dE = (v + v )/E1E' up n up wup >0 descent cost cruise cost climb costThe quantities E i, E c' and Ef are the initial, cruise, and final energies, respectively; d c is the cruise distance; and A = P/vgl is the E=E c cruise efficiency.The cruise distance d c can be written as d c = df -du~ddn where df is the desired range of the fl~ght, d up the distance to climb, and ddn the distance to descend.The climb and descent distances are obtained by integrating the range-rate equation (4) after a change of independent variable from t to E: where v u p and vdn are the climb and descent speeds at a given value of E, and v wup and vwdn are the corresponding wind speeds.(3)(4) dE (T D)v/W E dt - - dx dt = v gBefore applying optimal control theory to Eqs. ( 2)-( 4), the performance criterion must be transformed to integral form as follows:The Hamiltonian for the cost function ( 6) and state equation ( 7) provides the expressions for calculating the optimum climb and descent controls, as follows:A computationally efficient algorithm for calculating optimum time-constrained trajectories results from constraining the structure of the trajectories to match a typical airline flight; namely, a climb segment during which the specific energy E increases monotonically, a cruise segment, during which energy is constant, and a descent segment during which energy decreases monotonically.The cost function (Eq.( 5)1 can then be transformed to a form wherein the state variable E becomes the independent variable, thereby eliminating state equation (3) from the problem:where W f is the fuel flow.Thrust, drag, and fuel flow are complex functions of altitude, Mach number, and other physical parameters that are aircraft dependent.The necessary conditions of optimal control theory provide algorithms to minimize Eq. ( 5) subject to the constraints of Eqs.(3) and (4).The conditions show that minimizing J, subject to a final-time constraint tf. is equivalent to minimiZing J with a free finaltime, tf, for some, though unknown, choice of time cost factor Ct.However, the process of finding a value of C t that yields a specified tf involves iteration on C t and is analogous to the problem of finding adjoint variables to meet specified end conditions.OAt each value of energy during the climb and descent, the values of airspeed (v up' vdn) and thrust (T up• Tdn) that minimize the right sides of Eqs. ( 8) and ( 9) are the optimum controls at that energy.The two parameters C f and Ctin P (Eqs.( 8) and (9» are equivalent to the adjoint variables and are used here to adjust the length and time duration of the trajectory so as to match the input specifications.Although they must be determined by trial and error, the iteration process can be made numerically robust and fast by building into the algorithm knowledge of how changes in C t and C f affect the trajectory.For example, decreasing Cf increases the range, whereas increasing C t decreases the time to fly a given range.Typically, five to six iterations are sufficient for the trajectory to converge to a specified range and time to fly.It is important to minimize the number of iterations since each iteration step involves generating a complete climb and descent trajectory by integrating Eq. ( 7) with optimum controls computed from the minimization process ( 8) and ( 9).parameter 0, 0 ~c ~1 with the following interpretation:Versions of this algorithm have been incorporated in advanced flight-path management and ground-based flight planning systems. 7,e a = I implies maximum airspeed at all altitud es a = 0 implies minimum airspeed at all altitudes Procedural 4D Synthesis Between these extremes of 0, intermediate profiles are selected by interpolation as follows:= v + o(v -v )(11 )

Integration of Equations of ~otionSimilarly, if K is the known functional relation between v and v cas' v = K(v c as, h) then the last equation again reduces to an algebraic expression for the flight-path angle:The rules for speed-and altitude-profile synthesis described above can now be incorporated into the equations of motion to generat~the descent trajectory.In general, the foilowing three equations are adequate for this purpose:The program that implements this integration scheme currently uses an aerodynamic model and an engine model with characteristics similar to those of the Boeing 727.Even while operating in the highly nonlinear regions of these models, step sizes of 60 sec produce accurate results.Decreasing the step size further produces results differing on the order of only a foot in both altitude and distance over a typical descent from 35,000 ft to 5000 ft.About 30 integration steps are required to generate trajectories such as those shown in Fig. 4. The integration was completed in about 2 sec of CPU time on a DEC VAX 11-780.Selected as possible capture parameters at the end of ,10 integration interval are (1) Mach number, (2) CAS, (3) altitude, and (4) distance.Convergence to within a given tolerance of a parameter's ;pecified value is made by integrating past that value and then using a secant method to adjust the time-step and then repeating the integration step.Selected as input parameters for determining the flight profile are (1) inertial flight-path angle, (2) vertical velocity, and (3) engine pressure ratio (EPR) which determines thrust.For the first set of equations, the profile is determined when EPR is specified along with one of the other two input parameters.For the second set of equations, only one of the input parameters needs to be specified to determine the profile.These parameters can be specified as functions of altitude, distance, and time.accurate results with large step sizes in time.Here, there are actually two different sets of equations.The first set is the standard equations of motion for an aircraft in translational flight, Eqs. ( 12)-( 14).To be integrated by Runge-Kutta techniques, Eq. ( 14) is decomposed into x and h components.The description of the aircraft profile then becomes two simultaneous, second-order, nonlinear, differential equations.The second set is actually a simplification of the first set for the case in which either Mach number or calibrated airspeed (CAS) is to be held constant.The profile description then simplifies to two simultaneous, first-order, nonlinear, differential equations.The similarity between the two resulting integration routines allows them to be controlled by the same executive routine.(15) dx'( + (12 ) Cit v cos v w dh sin (13) dt = v y dv T -D sin(14 ) dt WTg -g O ( sin y =decelerations are performed by holding the aircraft at near-level pitch attitude.A descent clearance from ATC often requires pilots to complete a descent to a given altitude at a specified way point.Since reaching that altitude early is wasteful of fuel, pilots try to time the top-ofdescent point so as to minimize the leveling out di stance at the bottom of descent.This problem, which is a type of capture, is difficult to solve precisely without 3D navigation.Procedural synthesis of the altitude profile therefore adds a short level-flight segment at the bottom of a descent to model the errors in capturing by the manual descent procedure.where y is the aerodynamic flight-path angle, and V w is the component of wind speed in the flight-path direction.In addition, it is assumed that lift L and weight Ware related by L = Wcos y and that drag is a function of lift.In the constant-~~ch number and constant-CAS descent segments, only the first two equations need to be integrated.By using the relation between ~~ch number and true airspeed, v = M~(h) where ( is the speed of sound, the last equation reduces to the following algebraic expression: Since the ground-based ATC computers must generate trajectories for many aircraft in a very short time interval, an integration scheme is needed that integrates the equations of motion very rapidly and also captures certain given parameters such as altitude and airspeed.The fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration method 9 used here has the advantages of not requiring derivatives of the equations of motion and of givingsin y = (T -D)g!W aK all v + g(16)Speed-Profile IterationThe final step in the synthesis is to select the speed profile from the family if allowable profiles so as to achieve the specified landing time tf.This procedure requires iteration on the speed-profile parameter o.We first synthesize two limit trajectories by letting a assume the values 0 and I, resulting in landing times t max' t mi n.If the specified landing time falls within the range [tmin' t ma x] , we synthesize a third or nominal trajectory for cr = cr nom' resulting in a time, t nom' Otherwise, speed-profile
Speed Advisory SystemIn this algorithm, four numerical integrations are typically required to generate each 4D trajec_ tory.Numerical integration is computationally more demanding for real-time applications than other schemes, such as table look-up from a large number of stored trajectories.However, this disadvantage is far Outweighed by the fleXibility of the integration scheme to model realistically aircraft performance and complex wind profiles, which are crucial for accurate time prediction .By analyzing the results of air-trafficcontrol simulations conducted in our laboratory, we have arrived at an initial design of an operational system for ground-based time-control of unequipped aircraft.Figure 5 is an example of simulation results that contributed to the selection of the design parameter.It is a composite plot of ground tracks generated by 1.5 hr of heavy traffic flow into a terminal area similar to that of the JFK airport.Traffic arriving at the three feeder fixes or start points was initially handled by an arrival controller.The entry point into the arrival controller's airspace was about 120 n. mi.from touchdown for the two jet routes and about 70 n.mi. for the lowspeed route.It is clear from the small spread of the flight paths, as well as from the speed profiles (not shown) in the airspace where aircraft are descending from cruise altitude to the final controller hand-off points, that the arrival controller issued few, if any, vectors that caused  The three pairs of known relationships between t and 0 , (tmin' 1), (t ma x' 0), (t nom' G nom ), are used t o determine the constants a, b, and c in the estimator function .Finally, 0fe' the estimate of the a value that results in the specified landing time tf' is calculated by substituting 1f' 1 f = (t f -tmin)/(t max -t mi n), into the estimator.The ability of the estimator to predict the correct value of a depends on how well the quadratic function approximates the actual, but unknown, relationship between Of and tf' To check the accuracy of the estimate, the equations of motion must be integrated a fourth time in order to compute the actual landing time tfe corresponding to the estimate 0fe' If the timeerror t e = (tf -tfe) exceeds a specified error tolerance, the coefficients in the estimator can be updated and the procedure repeated.However, experience with the algorithm has shown that the accuracy of the initial estimate 0fe is sufficient for this application.For example, a landing time-error of less than 5 sec is obtained for a 110-n.mi.descent trajectory with a nominal descent time of 1100 sec.Figure 4 plots true airspeed versus touchdown distance for the maximum, minimum, and nominal speed profiles.The names of profile segments, and the landing time and the fuel consumption of each profile are indicated in the figure .aircraft to deviate from their nominal descent trajectories.In this region the controller is not able to visualize or predict future spacing conflicts at the merge point of the three traffic streams and, therefore, cannot participate in the ordering and spacing process.Thus, all such vectoring is performed by the final controller during the last 25-30 n. mi. of flight.This generates the broad spread of flight paths in the final control sector characteristic of present-day vectoring procedures.Although this method controls traffic successfully, it demands high skill and workload for the final control position.Furthermore, fuel is wasted and runway capacity is lost by the limitations inherent in concentrating ordering and spacing control within the confined airspace region close to touchdown.The procedural profile algorithm described earlier was incorporated in a system that gives the arrival controller the ability to participate effectively in the spacing control proc~ss.The intent was to derandomize and coordinate the traffic flow from the three directions before the final control sector.With inputs of desired landing time, current position, altitude, and speed, the speed advisory system (SAS) computes and displays the required Mach-number CAS that will cause the aircraft to land at the desired touchdown time.The arrival controller, who is presented with a table of speed advisories on his display, is responsible" for issuing the advisories to pilots as early as possible in the descent.As an aircraft descends, SAS continuously compares the predicted position with the actual position of the aircraft along its approach route in order to track the time-error.If the error exceeds a specified bound (:20 sec) at any time in the descent, SAS updates the speed advisory shown on the controller's display about once per minute.The update feature makes it possible to control the growth of time-errors owing to uncertain winds and other disturbances and to pilot tracking inaccuracies.Perhaps most importantly, it gives the controller the flexibility to scan the display and issue the speed advisories during a less busy time period.In practice, the number of profile updates the arrival controller can give is limited to three per aircraft, one at the top of descent, another at the midpoint, and a final one before the aircraft is handed off to the final controller at a distance of about 30 n. mi.from touchdown.After the hand-off has occurred, SAS data are removed from the controller's display.The final controller then uses traditional vectoring techniques to correct residual spacing errors in the merging zone.A recent evaluation of the system in a realtime air-traffic-control simulation has shown promising results.l o In general, traffic flowed smoother and was less difficult to control with SAS operational than without.There was a significant reduction in the spread of flight paths compared to that of the baseline case shown in Fig. S. A time-control accuracy of :20 sec at the final controller hand-off point appears to be an achievable goal.Further evaluations using 173 a joint piloted and ATC simulation are planned for the near future.
Concluding RemarksThe terminal-area traffic management system proposed in this paper performs two major functions that operate in sequence.One function establishes the landing order and assigns landing times for all aircraft scheduled to land.The second generates control commands that cause aircraft to achieve their landing times accurately.Two algorithms, one designed for onboard, the other for ground-based computer impl ementation, were derived for generating the neces sary control commands.Time-control commands generated by the ground system must be transformed into a compact form that minimizes the information transferred between controller and pilot.The speed advisory system described in this paper shows promise as an effective method of time-control for unequipped aircraft.Fig. 11Fig. 1 Terminal area traffic management system.
