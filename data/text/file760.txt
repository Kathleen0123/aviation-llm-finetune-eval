Summary of Phase-1 ResultsPhase-1, which tested workload with the prototype tool, GoSAFE, found that controller workload was significantly different (i.e., unbalanced) across the four controller positions (F= 130.47, df=3,130 , p<0.001).The Local East#1 (LE1) controller was significantly busier and experienced higher workload on the Workload Assessment Keypad (WAK) scale [7] than the other 3 controllers (see Table 1).The LE1 controller at DFW receives traffic from all directions, requiring management of traffic crossings through active runways for aircraft departing 17C and 13L, and for arrivals going to the terminals.Under phase-1, responsibilities of the GE2 controller had been substantially changed due to the introduction of GoSAFE [8] since this automation tool allowed LE1 to clear the aircraft crossing the active runways on DFW east 17R and 17C all the way to the gate, thereby reducing GE2's level of responsibility.Thus, GE2's tasks were reduced to monitoring the arrivals, while actively managing departures.The change in jurisdiction was identified in this phase.
6.B.2-2
Current (Phase-2) MethodologyThe current study used the phase-1 results to configure, and later test, new areas of responsibilities for the controllers that were changed due to the introduction of increased surface traffic and GoSAFE.In order to compensate for the uneven distribution of phase-1 workload, changes in the areas of responsibilities for the LE1 and GE2 controllers were introduced under phase-2.The changes in jurisdiction are shown in Figures 1 and2.The most prominent change involved reducing the area of responsibility for the LE1 controller.Specifically, phase-1 LE1 responsibilities of controlling aircraft crossing the south end of the active runways 17R and 17C, on taxiway ER, were transferred to GE2 under phase-2.Thus, the jurisdiction over the active runways was split in the north-south direction, where the north was controlled by LE1 and the south end of the runways was controlled by GE2.
Experimental ConditionsBoth phase-1 and phase-2 of the study used GoSAFE under two experimental conditions: (1) Mixed Communications and (2) Full Datalink, each with three scenarios that were randomly distributed among the runs.The Mixed Communications condition used GoSAFE to deliver the entire taxiway instruction (pre-clearance) via datalink, whereas all routine taxi clearances were issued in segments to the pilots using voice.In the Full Datalink condition, the complete taxi instruction (pre-clearance) and the routine taxi instructions in segments were issued via datalink.A total of 10 runs were conducted, half were mixed communications and the other half were full datalink.
HypothesesThe dependent measures of interest included Workload, Situation Awareness, and Communications.The hypotheses have been categorized under two categories -one that compared phase-1 and -2, and the other that focused on phase-2 only.It was hypothesized that (1) workload among controller positions would become more equally distributed under phase-2, as compared to phase-1, as a result of the DFW jurisdiction changes and the introduction of GoSAFE, (2) situation awareness would remain the same regardless of phase (phase-2 vs. phase-1), and condition (mixed communications vs. full datalink), (3) voice communication loads would be more equally distributed among controllers under phase-2 as compared to phase-1, in terms of number of transmissions and percentage of voice channel occupancy, and (4) under phase-2 jurisdiction, the controllers would experience higher workload in the mixed communications condition than in the full datalink condition.
ParticipantsThe participants in the study were four retired controllers (two local and two ground controllers) who participated in both phase-1 and phase-2 of the study.All participants were experienced tower controllers and one of them had DFW experience.On average, the participants had over 21 years of controller experience, and were retired for approximately six and a half years.In the current6.B.2-3 6.B.2-4study, the participants staffed four tower positions, consisting of two local controller and two ground controller positions.To implement the air traffic control tasks of the simulation, all controllerparticipants were trained on DFW and GoSAFE procedures.The controllers rotated through each of the positions, changing after each study run, to randomize individual effects as much as possible.The simulation also required 5 pseudo pilots who "flew" several aircraft within pre-defined geographical areas of the airport.
Facilities and Simulators UsedThe traffic in the simulations was created using the Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG), a ground and airborne target generator customized for advanced ATC research.The ATG parsed and executed the 4-D taxi commands and emulated the flight deck automation required to operate the concept.The ATG was integrated with GoSAFE using High Level Architecture (HLA).The arrivals were monitored by the local controllers using a JBRITE display, which is an emulation of the FAA's DBRITE.In the current study, all the controllers used the GoSAFE displays to manage traffic and there was no out-the-window view available in phase-2.Time synchronization, data collection and data management details were implemented over the HLA network.Additional details on the software architecture and modules are documented elsewhere [9].
Traffic and ScenarioExpected future levels of traffic were simulated for DFW.The east side of DFW with a south flow using runways 17R, 17C, 17L, and 13L under clear day conditions were simulated.In general, the traffic count for a 45 minute scenario was 140-160.This is approximately 1.5 times the current level of traffic for the east side only.The three scenarios included an arrival rush, an even flow of arrivals and departures, and a departure rush that morphed into an arrival rush.
ProcedureThe controllers used the GOSAFE displays for management of traffic.The GoSAFE displays are radar like displays on the surface that provide the entire taxi instruction or pre-clearance to the controllers, eliminating the need for high familiarity with the airport.The controllers issued segments of the pre-clearance as commands to pilots in simplified phraseology (by using segment numbers instead of reading the entire timed taxi instruction), which also mitigated the need for high levels of familiarity with the airport.
ResultsThe tools used to collect data included the Workload Assessment Keypad (WAK) [7] and Task Load Index (TLX) [10] scales for measuring workload, and the Situation Awareness Rating Scale (SART) [11] for measuring situation awareness.To assess WAK workload, the participants pressed a key on their workload pad every 5 minutes during the simulation run.This WAK key press represented the participant's assessment of current workload experienced, which ranged from 1 (low workload) to 7 (high workload).In addition, TLX and SART questionnaires were administered to each participant after every simulation run.The researchers also made observation notes and led group discussions with the controllers.All data analysis results from these sources are described in this section.
Workload (TLX and WAK)Table 2 presents summary statistics of the overall data distribution of workload, as measured on the TLX scale, with comparisons between phase-1 of the experiment (initial controller responsibility/ jurisdiction) and phase-2 of the experiment (new responsibility/ jurisdiction).As shown in Table 2, the change in controller jurisdiction had a beneficial effect on most of the controller workload variables, with less mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand and frustration, along with increased performance.However, none of these observed differences were large enough to reach statistical significance.
Table 2. TLX Workload by the PhaseFigure 3 shows a comparison of TLX workload ratings as a function of experiment phase (phase-1: initial jurisdiction, phase-2: new jurisdiction) and condition (mixed, full).Figure 3 shows relatively large differences between phase-1 mixed vs. full conditions, whereas smaller differences are indicated between phase-2 mixed vs. full conditions.Under the phase-1 jurisdiction, statistically significant differences between the mixed and full conditions on the dependent measures of physical demand (F=4.87,df=1,29, p<= 0.05) and temporal demand (F=5.45,df=1,20, p<= 0.05) were realized.Conversely, no statistically significant differences were indicated between mixed and full conditions under phase-2 jurisdiction.Hence, it seems likely that the change in jurisdiction between the two experiment phases had the overall effect of balancing the workload across the mixed and full conditions on the specific variables measured by the TLX scale (i.e., minimized any possible mixed/full effect).The availability of surface automation -GoSAFE aided in keeping the communication and coordination requirements down that would have otherwise increased due to the sharing of active runways with an increased volume of surface traffic.During group discussion, the controllers mentioned that LE1, under phase-2, experienced increased spare mental capacity.This allowed LE1 controllers to issue commands in a timely fashion to the mixed condition pilots, due to the workload redistribution under phase-2.Table 3 presents the differences of the means (absolute value) between the mixed/full conditions for each of the two phases of the experiment, on each of the TLX workload measures:
Table 3. Workload for Condition & Phase(*statistically significant at p < 0.5) Similar results were found with WAK workload, showing a significant interaction effect of phase and condition (F=25.58,df=1,1 , p<=0.05),where the phase-1 mixed/full workload difference of nearly 1 full scale point was virtually eliminated under phase-2.Figures 4 and5 illustrate this effect graphically.
Figure 5. Phase-2 WAK Workload by ConditionTable 4 shows the range of TLX workload means across the 4 controller positions (LE1, LE2, GE1, and GE2) for each of the two experiment phases.Here, range is defined as the difference between the highest mean workload and the smallest mean workload among the four controllers.The range provides a measure of variability of workload across the controller positions.The range values in Table 4 clearly show an overall rebalancing of TLX workload, as a result of the implementation of the new controller jurisdiction (supported by GoSAFE) in phase-2 of the experiment (i.e., the phase-2 range of means is considerably less than the phase-1 range of means in TLX workload measures).Figures 6 and7 illustrate the effects of controller position and experiment phase on the TLX workload ratings.Only those means corresponding to the LE1 and GE2 positions are presented, since there was insufficient phase-1 vs. phase-2 workload variability for the other two positions.This would make sense, since LE1 and GE2 are the only two controller positions directly impacted by the jurisdiction change implemented in phase-2.Figure 6 shows the phase-1 and phase-2 mean responses on each of the TLX workload measures, for position LE1 only.For the most part, responses on all of the workload measures show improvement under the new jurisdiction implemented in phase-2, as compared to the workload responses under the old jurisdiction in phase-1.There was less mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, effort and frustration, with a slight improvement in performance.It would appear that the implementation of the new controller jurisdiction in phase-2 had the effect of re-distributing workload across the LE1 and GE2 positions.Hence, the workload was spread out more evenly across both positions, with one position experiencing an increase and the other position experiencing a decrease in workload.Figures 6 and7 clearly show that the phase-2 distribution of means are much more similar to each other than the phase-1 distribution of means across the LE1 and GE2 positions, providing further evidence of the observed workload re-distribution.ANOVA statistics of controller position effects on workload for each phase are shown in Tables 5 and6.In general, the phase-1 analysis of position resulted in statistically significant differences on most of the TLX workload dependent measures (Table 5).Conversely, the phase-2 analysis of position on each of the workload measures resulted in only one statistically significant difference (Table 6).This would seem to provide further evidence of the workload re-distribution across positions, resulting from a change in controller jurisdiction.The controllers also mentioned that under phase-2, the GoSAFE technology assisted them with runway crossings, a task traditionally handled by the local controllers.It was further noted that in the absence of the surface technology provided by GoSAFE, this change in areas of responsibility would not have been operationally feasible due to the communication and coordination requirements under phase-2, especially with the increased level of traffic.A position by phase interaction effect of WAK workload (Figure 8) was also realized (F=15.83,df=3,406, p<= 0.05), with a general reduction of workload under phase-2, and similar trends across the controller positions (e.g., LE1 and GE2 workload re-distribution under phase-2).
Situation Awareness (SART)The change in controller jurisdiction implemented in phase-2 had the effect of improving situation awareness on all of the 10 SART measures.As compared to the phase-1 mean responses, the phase-2 mean responses indicated less instability, variability, complexity and division of attention.The phase-2 mean responses also indicated more alertness, spare mental capacity, concentration, information quantity, and familiarity.Statistical significance was achieved on the instability, concentration and familiarity measures.SART means and ANOVA statistics are listed in Table 7. Conversely, SART analysis results, broken down by experiment phase and mixed/full conditions, were less striking.While some marginal differences in the mixed/full condition were observed as a function of experiment phase, neither the main effect of the mixed/full condition, nor the interaction effect of phase by condition, for any of the SART measures, reached statistical significance.
6.B.2-7Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the interaction of experiment phase by controller position on situation awareness.Only the means for those controller positions directly impacted by the change in jurisdiction (i.e., LE1, GE2) are illustrated.Results for positions LE2 and GE1 are not shown, since their phase-1 vs. phase-2 differences were relatively consistent, relative to the LE1 and GE2 differences which were much more striking.
Figure 9. LE1 Situation Awareness by PhaseUnder phase-2 (as compared to phase-1), the LE1 position experienced less instability, variability, complexity, and division of attention.Under phase-2 (as compared to phase-1), the LE1 position also experienced more alertness, spare mental capacity, concentration, information quantity and familiarity, with about the same level of information quality (Figure 9 and Table 8).In group discussions, the controllers also indicated that, under phase-2, they had more spare mental capacity, especially in the mixed condition.So, in general, there was consistent improvement in situation awareness experienced in phase-2 as compared to phase-1 for position LE1.Under the original jurisdiction, the LE1 controller scrolled up and down the map to handle the aircraft crossing both the north and south ends of the active runways.Under the new jurisdiction where LE1 is no longer responsible for the south end of active runways, the LE1 controller scrolled between North 17L and 17R, and taxiways EM, up to the boundary of the new LE1 jurisdiction area.Hence, it would make sense that LE1 had better situation awareness under phase-2, since there was less jurisdiction area under their responsibility.The hypothesis that situation awareness would remain the same between the two phases was not upheld for LE1, since situation awareness improved due to better stability, and spare mental capacity brought about by the changes in controller jurisdiction.Under phase-2 (as compared to phase-1), the GE2 position experienced more instability, variability, complexity, alertness, concentration, division of attention and information quantity.Under phase-2 (as compared to phase-1), the GE2 position also experienced less spare mental capacity, and had about the same level of information quality and familiarity (Figure 10 and Table 8).So, while there was some improvement in situation awareness on several of the SART measures, there was also some degradation or no improvement on most of the measures.This finding is consistent with researchers' observations of phase-2 runs, where GE2 would occasionally ask LE1 if there were more departures on 17R, since aircraft on taxiways ER could not cross 17R until the departure aircraft had left the airport.Therefore, in this instance, GE2 experienced less situation awareness, requiring occasional controller coordination to develop a fuller awareness of surface traffic.However, it should be noted that while some degradation in situation awareness occurred, the level of degradation was usually less than one scale point, and situation awareness generally remained at a relatively high level.
6.B.2-8While Figures 9 and10 clearly show a general level of improvement in situation awareness for the LE1 position, and some degradation in situation awareness for the GE2 position, they also show these effects to be one of situation awareness redistribution across both positions, i.e., the LE1 and GE2 phase-2 curves are much more similar to each other than the LE1 and GE2 phase-1 curves.Situation awareness improvement for LE1 is quite high for some of the SART measures (e.g., instability, variability, complexity) while GE2 situation awareness degradation, if indicated at all, is generally low in magnitude.For instance, spare mental capacity increased for LE1 by 1.3 scale points, whereas GE2's spare mental capacity decreased by only 0.5 scale points.Combined with the relative lack of variability observed from the other two positions, this would point to an overall increased level in situation awareness across all positions.SART means and ANOVA statistics for the phase by position interaction effects are described in Table 8.Again, only cell means for the LE1 and GE2 positions are presented since there is insufficient variability in the phase-1 vs. phase-2 curves for the other two positions to account for any possible significant interaction effect.This would make sense, since again, LE1 and GE2 were the only positions to be directly impacted by the jurisdiction change implemented in phase-2.
Communication
Number of Voice Transmissions by Position & PhaseThe mean number of controller issued voice clearances by position and experiment phase is shown in Figure 11.The change in jurisdiction 6.B.2-9 between the two phases decreased the total number of voice clearances from 95.6 in phase-1 to 80.4 in phase-2 (all positions combined or overall effect of phase).However, this overall effect of phase was not statistically significant.ANOVA results did show an overall significant main effect for position (F=4.13,df=3,68, p<= 0.0094).When the position effect was broken down by phase, ANOVA results showed a significant phase-1 main effect (F=4.15, df=3,68, p <= 0.01), and a non-significant phase-2 effect.This would seem to indicate that the number of voice transmissions was more equally distributed across the positions under phase-2, as compared to phase-1. Figure 11 shows that LE1 experienced a large decrease in the number of voice clearances between the phases, from 201 to 118.Conversely, GE2 experienced a small increase in the number of voice clearances, from 40 to 62. Thus, the change in jurisdiction balanced the number of voice transmissions between the LE1 and GE2 positions, while decreasing the overall number of voice transmissions across the two positions.Under phase-2, the LE1 controller was not required to monitor both the north and south sections of the active runways.Hence, the LE1 controller was able to direct full attention to a smaller jurisdiction area.However, under the old jurisdiction (phase-1), GoSAFE required almost every aircraft on the airport to be handled by the LE1 controller.The graphical user interface (GUI) did not provide an inset map of the south side of the runways, so controllers focused on the north end of the runways, and would sometimes forget to issue clearances to aircraft on the south end of the runways.In phase-2, an inset could have partially mitigated the problem, but the workload would still remain high, thus a split in jurisdiction was warranted.The spilt in jurisdiction and the support provided by GoSAFE's new GUI under phase-2 eliminated this problem.In the absence of the decision support tool, GoSAFE, one would expect an increase in voice transmissions in phase-2 because of the split in authority over active runways.However, by using GoSAFE, the number of communications decreased and the simplification of phraseology developed by the researchers also positively impacted communications.
Voice Channel Occupancy by Position & PhaseVoice channel occupancy is defined as the percentage of radio frequency occupied relative to the total duration of the simulation run. Figure 12 shows the overall distribution of voice channel occupancy by controller position and phase.ANOVA results yielded a significant main effect of controller position (F=4.82,df=3,68, p<=0.01).When the position effect was broken down by phase, ANOVA results showed a significant phase-1 main effect (F=4.42, df=3,68, p <=0.01), and a non significant phase-2 effect.This would seem to indicate that voice channel occupancy was more equally distributed across the positions under phase-2, as compared to phase-1.Further, the means in Table 9 clearly show that LE1 experienced a large decrease, and GE2 experienced a small increase in voice channel occupancy, from phase-1 to phase-2.Thus, the change in jurisdiction balanced and lowered the amount of 6.B.2-10 communication and frequency congestion among the controller positions.
SummaryThis current research effort successfully implemented airport surface configuration changes based on the introduction of new surface automation.The changes directly impacted controller's roles and responsibilities without compromising their workload or increasing frequency congestion.In fact, these changes had the effect of decreasing both workload and frequency congestion while increasing situation awareness of local air traffic controllers.Additionally, some ground controllers experienced a relatively small increase in workload, which may have the beneficial effect of preventing tedium and vigilance decrement, often introduced by automation.Evidence of this was provided from the results of the current study, where the small increase in workload occurred concurrently with an increase in alertness and concentration (under phase-2, as compared to phase-1).All of these beneficial effects were possible due to the introduction of an automation tool (in this case, GoSAFE), allowing controllers to effectively work with an increased volume of surface traffic (relative to those handled by present day airport operations).The aviation community generally recognizes that sharing the management and control of active runways has the effect of increasing coordination and communication among controllers, and may also compromise safety [8].In the controllers' opinion the changes in areas of responsibility would not be acceptable to them in the current day or future operations due to the potential increase in communication load and a potential corresponding decrease in safety.They reported that the surface automation tool, GoSAFE, alleviated some of these concerns.The study also had some limitations.For example, due to practical and technical constraints, it was necessary to implement a randomized ANOVA, under circumstances where possible intercorrelations among the data points may have introduced some bias into the analysis.However, such bias was minimized by the experimental procedures which randomized possible individual effects.To increase the chance of further reducing such bias within the statistical analysis of data, further research with a larger sample size is recommended.Further research which examines other measures such as the controller's ability to deal with anomalies and off-nominal events is also needed to study the impact on safety.Finally, while we would expect that the introduction of GoSAFE in other airports would have similar effects as the current study, it is recommended that further research be conducted using test beds other than DFW, to gain a larger perspective on the generalizability of our findings.In summary, the results clearly indicated that the change in jurisdiction (areas of controller responsibility) and the implementation of GoSAFE had a re-distribution effect for positions LE1 and GE2, and an overall positive impact on the dependent measures of workload, situation awareness and communication, with 1.5 times the current level of traffic.Thus, introduction of new surface automation technology is likely to impact the division of roles and responsibilities between the human and automation.The increase in surface traffic had the effect of increasing the overall level of workload, while the introduction of GoSAFE in phase-1 led to an imbalance in this workload among the four controller positions.In the following phase, the same automation helped redistribute workload by re-designing the areas of responsibility for the controllers.Figure 2 .2Figure 1.Phase-1 Area of Responsibility
