OVERVIEW OF AUTOMATION SYSTEM CONCEPTThe Theoperationof the Scheduler, described in references 3 and5 is briefly reviewedhere.The primary inputsto the Scheduler areperiodicallyupdatedestimatedtimesof arrival (ETAs)for all aircraftthatare beingtrackedby the terminalarearadarsystems.WhentheETA of a newarrival first falls within the SchedulingWindow, which is definedasthetime interval betweenthe SchedulingandFreezeHorizons, the Scheduler beginsgeneratingscheduled timesof arrival (STAs).The Scheduler first attemptstoplace a newarrival at a time identicalto its ETA on therunway.If sucha choiceof STA createsa spacingviolation with previouslyscheduled aircraft,the Scheduler assignstheclosestavailabletime thatmeetsthe minimumallowed spacingdistanceon final approach.The minimum time separations usedby the Scheduler arederivedfrom minimum separation distances specifiedby FAA regulations.The minimum spacingdistances dependon the weightclasses of the aircraftin the landingsequence andcanberepresentedin a matrix of separation distances (n.mi.)asgivenin table1.As explainedin reference6, this matrix of distances is convertedto a corresponding matrix of time separations by incorporatingknowledgeof final approachspeeds.Furthermore, bufferson theorderof 10to 20 secareaddedto theseminimum time separations in orderto protectagainstunavoidable errorsin the ability to controllanding timesusingthe FAST advisories.The magnitudeof thedifferencesbetweenthe STAsandthe initial ETAs generated by the Scheduler depends both on the orderlinessof thearrival streamandon theexcessof the total arrival flow over the maximumlandingrate.If thearrivalsinto theTRACON airspacearecontrolledby theDA andTMA, theywill arriveat thegateswith only smalltime errorsandthe flow rate will matchthe runwayacceptancerate.In thatcasethe Scheduler in FAST will makeonly minorchangesin the STAsoriginally calculatedby the CenterTMA.Thesechanges will correctthe smalltime erroraccumulated during the descent andthe transitionfrom theCenterinto the TRACON.Mostof the time,therefore, the Scheduler will be ableto preservethe optimallandingsequence originally calculatedby the centerTMA.If the Centerautomationtools,DA andTMA, arenot in operation, theflow into theTRACON duringrushperiodswill be stronglybunchedandmay exceedthemaximumrunwayacceptance ratefor a periodof time.Because of maneuver airspace restrictionsandotherfactors,a TRACON Scheduler has lessfreedomto optimizethe arrival sequence thanthe CenterScheduler, andthereforecannotbeas effectivein reducingdelays.However,the FAST scheduler is designedto handlesuchdifficult flow conditionsin the bestpossibleway.It will generate landingsequences andSTAsthatminimizedelays subjectto operational constraints.Underexcess traffic load,the STAsgenerated by the Scheduler will absorbdelaysin theTRACON by holdingor pathstretching.An importantfunctionbuilt into the Scheduler is thecapabilityfor handlingmissedapproaches and popuptraffic.With thesefunctions,theScheduler opensup a time slot wheresuchaircraftcanbereinsertedinto the arrival sequence.Undersaturated traffic conditionstheinsertionof anextraslot will, inevitably,introducedelaysfor aircraft thatfollow the insertedaircraft.Thereschedulingfunction assists the controllerin finding a slot in the arrival sequence thatwill leastdisrupttheoveralltraffic flow.
Four-DimensionalTrajectory GeneratorThe FAST descent trajectory synthesis algorithm is a modified version of the Center DA algorithm.A detailed description of the algorithm is given in reference 3. Similar to the Center DA, it employs a second-order Runge-Kuttaforward integrationschemeto synthesize a pathto therunwaybasedon stan-dardTRACON operations, aircraft stateandtype,andwind speedanddirection.Upon arrival into TRACON airspace, theFAST 4D TrajectoryGenerator predictsthearrival time of an aircraftat the final approachfix (outermarker)basedon its currentposition,altitude,speed, and heading.The predictionis basedon a setof standard arrival routes,air speeddecelerationschedules, and altitudeprofiles thatconformto standard operations at a givenTRACON.Thecurrentimplementationof FAST is basedonDenverTRACON operationsfor arrivalsto StapletonInternational Airport.Next,the FAST 4D TrajectoryGenerator computesa rangeof arrivaltimesbasedon theaircraft speedenvelope andallowablepathextension. Thesepredictedtrajectoriesareupdatedevery5 sec.If the STA andETA arethe same, the aircraft is maintainedon its present nominalpath,altitude,andspeed profile to the runway.If the ETA showsthe aircraftto beearly,theFAST 4D TrajectoryGenerator will synthesize a descent trajectorythatattemptsto eliminatethe time errorby first decreasing the aircraftairspeedand then,if necessary, extendingthe pathdistanceto the runway.If the ETA showsthe aircraftto be late,the controlleris advisedto havethe aircraftmaintainhigherspeeds or shortenits pathto therunwayby utilizing the HorizontalGuidanceModesthatwill bedescribednext.Constructionof thehorizontalroutealwaysbeginsat the currentpositionandheadingof the aircraft andterminatesat thefinal approachfix.The currentpositionneednot beon a standard path.The controller mayvector the aircraft anywherein theTRACON arrival airspaceanda horizontalroutewill be synthesized basedon eithera route-intercept (RI) procedureor a waypointcapture(WC) procedure (refs.3, 4).Routeinterceptoperates in conjunctionwith a setof standard or nominalarrival routesconverging onthe final approachcourseto therunway.Theroutescomprisingthe nominalarrival pathfrom the noah to Rwy 26L atDenver'sStapleton International Airport are the final approach course extending 15 n.mi.beyond the outer marker (Altur), a base leg positioned 5.5 n.mi.from the outer marker and extending 15 n.mi.noah from and perpendicular to the final approach course, and a downwind leg positioned 5 n.mi.noah of and parallel to the final approach course (fig.1).Each route has a corridor width of +1 n.mi.relative to its center line.As an aircraft enters the TRACON airspace from one of the feeder gates (Drako or Keann) the FAST trajectory synthesis algorithm puts the aircraft into a free vector mode.In this mode, the algorithm seeks an interception of one of the defined route segments by extending the instantaneous heading vector.From the first point of interception, the algorithm completes the path by following along the nominal route to the final approach fix.After the aircraft has captured the downwind leg, the horizontal synthesis computes a new RI of the base leg.Similarly, once the aircraft has intercepted the base leg, a new RI of the final approach course is computed.The path to the runway is recomputed approximately every 5 sec based on the current position and heading.This free-vector mode with RI logic allows the controller the freedom to vector aircraft anywhere in the arrival airspace and still maintain a highly accurate estimate of arrival time as long as the aircraft is heading for a standard route segment.The horizontal path synthesized by the waypoint capture (WC) mode consists of an initial circular arc starting at the current position and course followed by a straight-line segment leading directly to a designated capture waypoint, and ending with a circular arc turn intercepting the route containing the capture waypoint.The geometry of this construction is illustrated in figure 2. The algorithm determines theradiusof theturn from the airspeed, wind speed, andmaximumallowablebankangle.Furthermore, thedirectionof the turn towardthecapturewaypointis chosensothatthe total lengthof the pathis minimized.In orderto compensate for computational delaysandto allow for controllerresponse time, the algorithmalsomovesthe startof the turn ateachcomputational cycle a distanceequivalentto 10sec of flight time aheadof thecurrentaircraftposition.As in othertrajectorysynthesis modes, the predictive algorithmrefreshesthe WC profile in a 5-seccycleusing updatedaircraftstateinformation.TheWC modecanbe manuallyselected by the controllerfor specialsituationssuchasmissedapproachguidance.It is alsoselected automaticallyby FAST if the RI modefails to generatea4D trajectoryunder certaincircumstances.
Graphical Advisory InterfaceSimilar to the Center DA, a vertical time line is used to display the current STA and ETA for all aircraft in, or expected to arrive in, the TRACON airspace.The right side of the time line displays the current ETA for each aircraft in green.The left side of the time line displays the current STA for each aircraft in blue if arriving from the West and white if arriving from the East.This increases the speed with which the controller can correlate an aircraft's location on the time line with its location on the plan view display (PVD).If the STA and ETA are different during the aircraft's flight in the TRACON, FAST will provide speed advisories and heading vectors required for the aircraft to meet the STA.As the advisories are displayed, the ETA on the time line will adjust itself to reflect the effect of each update.When FAST determines that a speed adjustment is necessary at a given point and the aircraft is within 5 n.mi. of that point, the advised Indicated Airspeed (IAS) is displayed on the aircraft data tag below the ground speed in orange.The use of color on the tag alerts the controller that an advisory is pending.Having the advised speed on the tag allows the controller to maintain his concentration on the aircraft position.In addition, the point along the current predicted path where the speed adjustment should be issued is highlighted with an orange marker to correlate with the orange speed advisory on the data tag.The 5-n.mi.advance notice and spatial display of the position at which the speed adjustment should occur allows the controller to plan ahead for its issuance.Another common technique used by TRACON controllers to delay or advance an aircraft is to extend or compress the downwind leg of the approach path or vary the intercept of the final approach course.Thus, when an aircraft arrives from the West to land on Rwy 26L and is within 5 n.mi. of its advised turn to base or turn to final, the data block is colored blue and a blue turn arc appears at the position where the instruction to turn should be issued.Once the aircraft has completed the base or final turn, the aircraft color reverts back to green, and the turn arc for that aircraft disappears.Similarly, aircraft arriving from the East are color-coded white for base and final turn advisories.The positions of the base and final turn advisories vary for each aircraft depending on its current time error relative to its STA and are displayed in the position that will eliminate the error.In addition to its display on the time line, time error is also displayed below the altitude slot on the third line of each aircraft's data tag.The arrival time error, in seconds, is preceded either by an "E" for early or an "L" for late.The controller may use this "Time Error" mode alone or in combination with the Speed/Vector and Time line advisory modes to improve time control accuracy.At the end of a simulation week, each controller was given a questionnaire and interviewed about the operational aspects of using the automation tools.Detailed results of these interviews, the pilot evaluations, and the accuracy data for the trajectory prediction algorithm will be presented in a later report.
SIMULATION RESULTSSimulation results presented in this paper briefly address the issues of airspace utilization, interarrival spacings, capacity effects, and controller evaluations.
Airspace UtilizationOne of the primary measures of an automation tool for final approach spacing is airspace utilization.The composite ground tracks of aircraft for the two types of runs discussed earlier, baseline and FAST+DA+TMA, areshownin figures3 and4.Thefiguressuperimpose thehorizontalplaneprojectionsof the flight pathsof all arrivalsrecordedduringa typical simulationrun.Thesefiguresshowtraffic arrivingfrom boththe northeast (Keann)andnorthwest(Drako)feedergates.Therunway is located in the southwest quadrant of thesefiguresandis markedwith an"X".The compositegroundtracksin bothof thesefiguresresultedfrom the samelist of input traffic coveringa time rangeof slightly more thanonehourof capacitylimited flow (40-46aircraftperhour).They arerepresentative of all otherruns madeby the other controllers.In all runs, traffic was controlled by a single controller.In the baseline run (fig.3), the controller used considerably more airspace to merge and sequence traffic.By the end of the run, traffic had backed up such that he was turning the aircraft onto the final approach course 18 n.mi.from the runway instead of the nominal 10 n.mi.The length of the final approach allowed at Denver without having to coordinate with other controllers is approximately 20 n.mi.from the runway.In the automation run (fig.4), almost all aircraft were turned to final at the nominal point between 10 and 11 n.mi.from the runway.There were a few aircraft turned to base and final further out; however, this occurred at the advice of FAST in order to precisely alleviate potential conflicts and to build slots for aircraft which arrived in the TRACON off schedule.Although these aircraft were turned to base and final further from the runway, this did not cause a buildup in delay of trailing aircraft as would be the case in a manual system.Rather it served to alleviate a buildup in delay, and kept each trailing aircraft on its nominal and shortest turn to base and final paths.The ability of the automation tools to precisely expand and contract the base and turn to final points provides considerable advantages to the controller.Assisting the controllers in keeping most aircraft on a short final allows them plenty of airspace to expand in case of an overload of traffic.In the baseline run, if an overload of traffic were to arrive, the controller would soon be forced to use alternative procedures to control the traffic, such as holding, sending traffic upwind then downwind (i.e., from the northeast arrival stream to the downwind portion of the northwest arrival stream), or to shut off the Center traffic feed for several minutes.
Interarrival SpacingsData were also recorded on interarrival spacing of aircraft for both the baseline and automation runs.Tables 2 and3 present the results of all runs with capacity limited flow rate for all controllers.These tables present the sequence of aircraft (L for large, H for heavy), mean interarrival distances at touchdown (d), one-sigma standard deviation of distance (Od), mean interarrival time at touchdown (t) and one-sigma standard deviation of time (_t).As a point of reference, the desired distance separation for the LL and LH case is 3 n.mi., and the scheduling interval for this case was 78 sec.For the HL case, the desired distance separation is 5 n.mi., and the scheduling interval was 125 sec.Although the controllers were instructed to adhere strictly to the FAST advisories, no data were deleted for the few cases when the controller missed or ignored the advisories.The questionnaire also showed that the speed and vector advisories were their favorite feature.When the advisories did not coincide with their own plan, they commented that the FAST generated plan was just as good and sometimes better.They did not find that additional vectoring was necessary beyond the FAST advisories, and they thought the tools were flexible and did not feel restricted in their own decision making.Several suggestions were made for improving the controller interface though none of the suggestions pointed to basic changes or major additional requirements in the interface design.Some controllers suggested a "distance-based time line" on which in-trail distance projected at the runway is displayed rather than time.Such a method has been used in the Center DA tool and could be adapted to the TRACON.FIGURES ............................................................................................................................................ 12

Table 22contains values measuredfor the baseline case which are very similar to those measuredforthe manual system in reference1. The tables show a substantialdecrease in interarrivalspacing in bothdistance and time. The automationtool runs resulted in a decrease in mean distanceseparationof0.4 n.mi. and a decrease in mean time separationof 9.8 sec for the LL and LH case. Most significantisthe decrease in the standard deviationsof both distanceand time separationsseen in the tables. Similarresults are seen for the HL case.
