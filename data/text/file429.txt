SummaryAviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) provide surface weather information at and around observation stations, including airport terminals.These weather observations are used by pilots for flight planning and by air traffic service providers for managing departure and arrival flights.METARs are also an important source of weather data for Air Traffic Management (ATM) analysts and researchers at NASA and elsewhere.These researchers use METAR to correlate severe weather events with local or national air traffic actions that restrict air traffic, as one example.A METAR is made up of multiple groups of coded text, each with a specific standard coding format.These groups of coded text are located in two sections of a report: Body and Remarks.The coded text groups in a U.S. METAR are intended to follow the coding standards set by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).However, manual data entry and edits made by a human report observer may result in coded text elements that do not follow the standards, especially in the Remarks section.And contrary to the standards, some significant weather observations are noted only in the Remarks section and not in the Body section of the reports.While human readers can infer the intended meaning of nonstandard coding of weather conditions, doing so with a computer program is far more challenging.However such programmatic preprocessing is necessary to enable efficient and faster database query when researchers need to perform any significant historical weather analysis.Therefore, to support such analysis, a computer algorithm was developed to identify groups of coded text anywhere in a report and to perform subsequent decoding in software.The algorithm considers common deviations from the standards and data entry mistakes made by observers.The implemented software code was tested to decode 12 million reports that had been collected from 267 airports over 1,575 days.The decoding process was completed in about 20 minutes, which translates to a sustained rate of about 10,000 reports per second.Of the 12 million reports, the decoding process was able to completely interpret 99.93 percent of the reports.The remaining reports (0.07 percent) were partially interpreted and any un-decodable texts within each report were identified.This document presents the deviations from the standards and the decoding algorithm.Storing all decoded data in a database allows users to quickly query a large amount of data and to perform data mining on the data.Users can specify complex query criteria not only on date or airport but also on weather condition.This document also describes the design of a database schema for storing the decoded data, and a Data Warehouse web application that allows users to perform reporting and analysis on the decoded data.Finally, this document presents a case study correlating dust storms reported in METARs from the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport with Ground Stops issued by the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC).Blowing widespread dust is one of the weather conditions when dust storm occurs.By querying the database, 294 METARs were found to report blowing widespread dust at the Phoenix airport and 41 percent of them reported such condition only in the Remarks section of the reports.When METAR is a data source for an ATM research, it is important to include weather conditions not only from the Body section but also from the Remarks section of METARs.
IntroductionAviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) contain surface weather information collected from a weather observation station.These reports are vital to pilots during flight planning, as well as to air traffic service providers who must determine the capacity of airspace or an airport in the presence of various weather phenomena.The reports are also of use to analysts seeking to study weather impacts on Air Traffic Management (ATM) decision making.Therefore they represent a valuable source of data to be mined if they can be interpreted by software.A METAR reporting station can be either automated or manual.In general, a report is scheduled to be disseminated on an hourly basis.When there is a significant weather change, an unscheduled Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI) is disseminated.Each report has two sections: Body and Remarks.The text in the report follows standard coding formats as documented in the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 (FMH1) [1] by NOAA.Contractions are also used throughout a METAR.In the Body section of a report, there are 11 basic measurements and present weather observations.Fifty-eight types of possible coded remarks such as detailed observations may be appended to a METAR.A blank space is used as the delimiter between each group of coded text.Each group of coded text may include free-form text that may also include blank spaces.The lack of using a distinct character to separate groups of coded text, and the deviations from the coding standards in each group, pose significant challenges to a software-based METAR decoding.Focusing on decoding the coded text only in the Body section risks the chance of missing important observations reported in the Remarks section.Thus, decoding all the coded text in a METAR is essential to getting a full picture of all the conditions at an observation station.This document describes the results of analyzing deviations from standard coding formats identified in 12 million METARs collected from 267 airports over 1,575 days.From these 12 million reports, all significant deviations were identified and categorized.These deviations are also described here because they are critical to understanding reports that don't follow the standard coding formats.Of the 12 million reports, 99.93 percent of them can be completely interpreted after the deviations were taken into account.The remaining reports were partially interpreted and any un-decodable texts within each report were identified for future analysis.This document presents an algorithm for identifying and decoding all groups within a METAR so that all of the report content may be used.The decoded METAR data are stored in the NASA Ames Aviation Systems Division ATM NextGen Data Warehouse to allow ad-hoc user query and data mining.The design of the database schema for storing the decoded METAR data is also presented in this document.This document describes the capability of the Data Warehouse web application for reporting and analyzing METAR data.Finally this document presents a case study of correlating dust storms reported in METARs from the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Ground Stop advisories issued by the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC).The case study emphasizes the importance of including weather conditions not only from the Body section but also from the Remarks section of METARs when conducting ATM research involving METAR as a data source.
Current METAR Decoding ToolsThere are many METAR decoding tools that are available to the public, and they are written in different programming languages.One of them is the "Python METAR parser" open-source project [2], and it is written in Python.This tool decodes about 20 out of 69 METAR observations and remarks.It can only decode well-formatted coded text.When mal-formatted coded text is encountered, the tool aborts immediately.As will be described later, the tool documented in this paper decodes all METAR observations and remarks, and mal-formatted coded text is identified and processed accordingly.
Collecting METAR DataThere are three main data sources that provide METARs:  [3].Many groups from the Remarks section such as Lightning and Thunderstorm Location are not decoded and made available.Furthermore, ADDS can only decode groups that conform to the standard coding format described in FMH1.ADDS also imposes a limit of 1,000 reports per Web Services call.Because NOAA's FTP site imposes no such limit, it is chosen to be the primary data source.In case any files cannot be downloaded from the FTP site because of problems on the client side, the Weather Underground web site is used as the alternative source; it does not have any date range limit when compared to the last-141-hour limit imposed by ADDS.METARs from the NOAA's FTP site contain reports from over 4,000 observation stations.Of these observation stations, only those corresponding to 267 airports are analyzed and decoded.The 267 airports are from a superset of 264 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) staffed facilities [4], 35 FAA Operational Evolution Partnership (OEP) airports [5], and 77 FAA Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) airports [6].
Coding Format OverviewIn order to decode a METAR, one needs to first understand the METAR coding format.Weather observations and other information reported in a METAR are divided into "groups" of coded text.Each group has its own unique coding format.There are two sections in a METAR: Body and Remarks.The Body section contains 11 groups (e.g., Weather Station ID, Wind, and Visibility).The Remarks section contains groups that are further classified in two categories: 36 groups in the "Automated, Manual, and Plain Language" category, and 22 groups in the "Additive and Maintenance Data" category.See Appendix A for complete details.A sample decoded METAR is described later in section 0.Often observations reported in the Body section may be described with further details in the Remarks section (e.g., start time, end time, frequency, intensity, and location and direction of thunderstorms).The Remarks section is the portion of the METAR where an observer can enter plain text to describe weather phenomena qualitatively.It should be noted that some observations are only reported in the Remarks section (e.g., lightning).The coding format for each group in a METAR is described in NOAA's FMH1 [1] and in FAA Advisory Circulars 00-45G, Aviation Weather Services (AWS) [7].FMH1 is the definitive source on the METAR coding format.AWS compliments the FMH1 by describing METAR information as well as other weather products but leaves out information that has no direct impact on the aviation community.It also includes photographs of significant clouds and examples of decoded METARs.Contractions are referenced throughout in a METAR.Standard contractions are described in the Aviation Weather Contractions document [8].
Observations Described Only in Remarks SectionOf the 12 million METARs analyzed, 97.66 percent of reports have Remarks.One example of observations that are noted in both the Body and Remarks sections is thunderstorms.Of those METARs, there are 100,203 having thunderstorms referenced only in the Remarks section and not in the Body section.Normally, thunderstorm observations are first noted in the Body section and details are noted in the Remarks section.Details include the beginning and/or ending time of thunderstorms, and the location and moving direction.Among those 100,203 reports, 23,437 reports have locations and/or movement directions of the thunderstorms, and 2,010 of those (2 percent) have thunderstorms occurring within 5 statute miles of airports.In other words, a reader of those 2,010 reports can only be aware of thunderstorms at the airports by reading the Remarks section, because they are completely missing in the Body section.Figure 1 shows the number of those 23,437 reports broken down by airport (OEP 35 vs. non-OEP 35 airports) and thunderstorm locations.Lightning at an airport can affect ramp operations due to safety concerns to the ground personnel and may cause or worsen departure and arrival delays.Of the 12 million METARs analyzed, 263,685 reports have lightning observations in the Remarks section.In FMH1, lightning is not described in the Body section at all.89,590 reports (34 percent) have lightning occurring within 5 statute miles of airport.Figure 2 shows the number of those 263,685 reports broken down by airport (OEP 35 vs. non-OEP 35 airports) and lightning locations.
Blank Space as a DelimiterIn FMH1, each group has its own unique coding format that may include a blank space character.A blank space character is not only used as a delimiter between groups, it is also used as a delimiter within the text of a group.Therefore one cannot assume that any text between two blank spaces is automatically a group.Table 1 shows a sample METAR from AWS.The "Present Weather", "Sky Condition", "Peak Wind", and "Lightning" groups contain one or more blank spaces within the respective group, as indicated with the grey background.
Coding Missing DataAccording to FMH1, Section 12.5, "When an element does not occur, or cannot be observed, the corresponding group and preceding space are omitted from that particular report."In other words, the number of groups in a report is not constant.When a group has no data to report in a METAR, it is simply skipped in the report.No special placeholder text such as "-NS-" is used.
Undocumented GroupsBoth the FMH1 and AWS publications lack documentation on some groups found in the Remarks section of many historical METARs.After thorough analysis of historical METARs, these undocumented groups were identified.These groups and their respective coding formats are described below.
Depth of New Snow (931nnn)Depth of new snow (snowfall) is reported every 6 hours at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC, when any amount of snow has fallen in the past 6 hours.931 is the group indicator and nnn represents the depth of new snow in the past 6 hours reported in tens, units, and tenths of inches, using three digits.The new snow includes snow pellets, snow grains, ice pellets, ice crystals, and hail.For example, during the 6-hour period it snows two times.After the first snow there are 2.3 inches of new snow.Before the second snow, 0.5 inches of the new snow melts.The second snow adds another l.4 inches of new snow.The new snow depth is the sum of 2.3 and 1.4 inches, or 3.7 inches.The reported value of new snow does not include melted snow so the group "931nnn" would be coded "931037".Further details are described in the NOAA's Supplementary Climatological Data [9].
Ice Accretion (IHnnn)Amount of ice accreting is measured on a flat surface (planar icing) as estimated by the data from a freezing rain sensor.IH is the group indicator where H can be 1, 3, or 6.When H is 1, the measurement is reported hourly for the past hour.When H is 3, the measurement is reported at 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100 UTC for the past 3 hours.When H is 6, the measurement is reported at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC and covers the past 6 hours.nnn represents the thickness accumulated to the nearest one-hundredth of an inch.A trace amount is encoded as "000".For example, an ice accretion of 0.04 inch in the past hour and an ice accretion of 0.11 inch at 1500 UTC would be coded "I1004 I3011".Further details are described in the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Release Note [10].
Significant Cloud Type Cumulus (CU_LOC)Cumulus cloud is coded in the format CU_LOC where CU is the cloud type and LOC is the direction from the station.The cloud type and location entries are separated from each other with a space.For example, cumulus clouds beyond 10 but less than 30 nautical miles of the station in the direction of north through north-east through south-east would be coded "CU DSNT N-NE-SE".
Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS) [Plain Language]Low-level wind shear should be coded as LLWS followed by optional descriptive text.For example, "LLWS +/-15KT".
Pilot Report (PIREP) [Plain Language]Pilot report maybe coded as PIREP followed by observations from a pilot.For example, "PIREP 2118Z ON FINAL RWY 36L LGT RIME ICG AT 030MSL TEMP -4C BY E-135".
Deviations From Group Coding FormatBecause blank spaces cannot be solely used to identify each group in a report, and because groups can be omitted from a report when there are no data to report, identifying all groups in a report is the first step in decoding a METAR.The text in a METAR needs to be divided into separate groups by matching up each group's coding format.Twelve million historical METARs were analyzed to check if groups can be identified by their coding formats.The METARs from the analysis show that the reports contain groups that do not conform to the coding formats as specified in FMH1.Deviations from the coding format are likely due to manual data entry or editing by a human observer.Major deviations were identified in the following 16 subsections.
Groups Not Reported in Suggested OrderThe order of the groups reported in a METAR is usually the same order as listed in Appendix A. However, this is not true in every report.Some reports have groups that do not follow the suggested order documented in FMH1, especially in the Remarks section.Hence, it is incorrect to assume that groups in a report are always in the suggested order.Table 2 shows some such examples in highlighted text with misplaced groups in bold.
Combining Multiple Groups Into One GroupSometimes an observer may, for convenience, combine two separate or similar groups that share the same condition by using "/" and "AND".Table 6 shows some examples of combined groups in highlighted text.
Single Group is Split Into Multiple GroupsIf a group has multiple observations, the observations should be reported adjacent to each other to form a single group.Some METARs have a group being split into multiple non-adjacent parts of the report.Table 7 shows some examples of these cases, with repeated groups in highlighted text.
Missing Separator RMKA proper METAR should have a "RMK" separator to separate the Body section from the Remarks section.Some reports miss the "RMK" separator.Table 8 shows some examples in highlighted text with the missing "RMK" in bold.
Wrong Order Within Group Coding FormatSome coding formats have a specific order of codes within a group.For example, the Lightning group has the format of Frequency_LTG(type)_[LOC], where there is an optional frequency contraction, followed by a space, followed by LTG and a lightning type ("CG" (cloud-to-ground), "IC" (in cloud), "CC" (cloud-to-cloud), and "CA" (cloud-to-air)), and followed by an optional space and lightning location in plain text.Table 9 shows some examples where this format is not followed, with errors in highlighted text and misplaced codes in bold.
Unexpected Descriptors in GroupsSome groups do not specify a descriptor (e.g., shape, intensity, frequency) as part of their coding formats, yet some reports show such descriptors.Table 10 shows some examples in highlighted text with the unexpected descriptors in bold.
Use of FEW as Descriptor and Cloud Cover LayerIn a METAR, the contraction FEW can be used as an optional descriptor of weather phenomena (e.g., cloud or obscuration) and as a cloud cover type.When there is a contraction FEW in a report, it is necessary to examine the preceding and the following coded text to determine to which side FEW belongs.Table 11 shows some examples in highlighted text and the corresponding groups.
Using Nonstandard ContractionsIn some METARs, some groups do not use standard contractions.Table 12 shows some examples from the Beginning and Ending of Precipitation group in highlighted text, and nonstandard contractions in bold.
Use of NO in RemarksThough occurring rarely and being nonstandard according to FMH1, a remark may negate an earlier remark within the same METAR.For example, instead of removing an erroneous remark, "SNB1455E1458" (snow began at 1455Z and ended at 1458Z), from a report, an observer may choose to insert a negating remark "NO SN" to correct the erroneous one in the same report.When a report user reads the coded text of such a METAR from the left to the right, the first encounter of "SN" can lead to the premature conclusion of the presence of snow only to find out that it is negated later on.After detailed analysis was performed on these rare reports, it is confirmed that these corrections are made only to the erroneous remarks within the same reports and not to the earlier transmitted reports.Table 13 shows some examples in highlighted text and negating remarks in bold.In some other METARs, "NO" is used to describe the absence of an observation.When there is nothing to be reported, it should be omitted from the report in general.Otherwise, a METAR would be very long just to note the absence of everything possible.Table 14 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and the absence remarks are in bold.In some rare METARs, "NO" is used to describe problems with transmitting the METARs, and they have remarks unrelated to weather observations.Table 15 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and the NO indicators are in bold.
Typographical Errors in Use of 0 (Zero) and O ("Oh")In some METARs, there are some mistaken uses of the letter O (capital letter "Oh") and 0 (digit zero).Table 16 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and typographical errors are in bold.
Misspelling of ContractionsIn some METARs, some contractions do not follow the standards.Table 17 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and misspellings are in bold.
Inserting Extra Blank SpacesIn some METARs, extra blank spaces are inserted into the coded text.Table 18 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and extra blank spaces are underscored.
Missing Blank SpaceMany coding formats of groups have a blank space within the formats.Yet many METARs do not insert those required blank spaces.For example, when 1.5 statute miles of visibility is coded as "11/2SM" instead of "1 1/2SM", it would be interpreted as 5.5 statute miles.According to FMH1, all the expected fractions are from "1/16", ..., "1/2", ..., to "3/4".Each allowed fraction always has a numerator smaller than the denominator.Even though "11/2" is a legitimate fraction, an experienced reader would interpret it as "1 1/2" instead.Blank space is also a delimiter between two groups, but many METARs miss these blank spaces or use different characters.Table 19 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and missing blank spaces are underscored.
Missing or Wrong Units of MeasureIn the Body section, three groups require units of measure as part of the coding format: Wind group is in KT (knots), Visibility group is in SM (statute miles), and Runway Visual Range group is in FT (feet).All temperate-related groups do not require an explicit statement of the units because they are always reported in degrees Celsius implicitly.Take the example of a five-digit number "11009".Without a unit of measure in the coded text, and without knowing the position of the coded text in the report, "11009" should technically be a 6-Hourly Maximum Temperature of -0.9°C because it matches the coding format of the 6-Hourly Maximum Temperature group.In the group format, the first digit "1" is the group indicator, the second digit "1" indicates a negative value ("0" means zero or positive temperature value), and the last three digits express temperature in tenths of degrees Celsius.But if "11009" is located within the Body section, it is more likely to be a Wind group despite the missing unit of measure "KT".In other words, "11009" should be decoded as a 6-hourly maximum temperature of -0.9°C instead of 11 knots wind from the direction of 9 degrees, but at times the Wind value is what is intended.When there is a "KT" suffix to the five-digit number, then there is no ambiguity.Such cases of missing units of measure exist in METARs.Table 20 shows some examples where groups are in highlighted text and missing units of measure are in bold.
Missing Leading or Trailing ZeroesMany groups require a fixed number of digits in their coding formats.Leading or trailing zeroes are often required to meet the coding formats and to avoid mistaking them for other groups.Without correct leading or trailing zeroes, a coded text requires an educated guess to interpret it.For example, the Temperature and Dew Point group requires the format T'T'/T' d T' d where T'T' is a two-digit temperature in Celsius and T' d T' d is a two-digit dew point in Celsius.A value of "9/3" can be reasonably interpreted as temperature 9°C and dew point 3°C, instead of 90°C and 30°C respectively, but it does not meet the standard.Another example is the Sky Condition group.It has a coding format of NNNhhh where NNN is a contraction of sky layer and hhh is the layer's 3-digit height in hundreds of feet.When hhh is a two-digit number, there can be a missing leading zero or trailing zero.Because multiple sky layers can be in a Sky Condition group, and each sky layer can be followed by a higher sky layer, examination of adjacent layers can give a hint as to whether the missing digit is a leading zero or a trailing zero.But some coded text cannot be decoded at all.For example, consider the Wind group.In the simplest format, it has a coding format of a three-digit wind direction in degrees followed by a two-or three-digit wind speed in knots.That is a total of five or six digits, depending on whether the wind speed is less than 100 or over 100 knots.A value of "2005KT" has a missing digit.Let us assume that the missing digit is a zero.But without knowing where the missing zero is, it is impossible to know whether it is 02005KT (20 degrees with 5 knots), or 20005KT (200 degrees with 5 knots).Table 21 shows some examples where decoding was possible based on other knowledge; groups are in highlighted text, and missing leading or trailing zeroes are in bold.
Algorithm for Decoding Body and Remarks SectionsThis section presents the algorithms developed to extract the maximum possible information from METARs in light of the format deviations presented in section 0. As illustrated in section 5, an algorithm relying solely on the standard coding formats from FMH1 to identify groups and group content would certainly fail in a significant number of cases where the formatting is not followed.This section describes the algorithm for identifying groups and decoding them.The algorithm was developed to address the following major issues found among the 12 million METARs:• There is no unique separator character between each group.Even though there is supposed to be a blank space character, a blank space character is often also found within the text of a group, especially in groups containing plain text.And some groups are adjacent to each other without any separators.The missing separators are likely caused by manual edits of the reports prior to report submission.• Groups are not always reported in the standard group order as described in FMH1.Manual edits of some reports may insert groups that do not follow the standard group order.• Multiple contiguous texts of the same group type may be found in a correctly coded METAR.However cases were found where they are not adjacent as they should be.Manual edits may append additional observations to the end of the report instead of editing existing observations.
Using Regular Expressions for Text Pattern MatchingCentral to the algorithm is the use of regular expression [11] processing to perform text pattern matching.There are two main reasons for using regular expressions.First, a regular expression can be used to find whether a piece of text in a report matches the coding format of a group.If a match is found, there is a "group-marker", and the piece of corresponding text in the report can be located.Second, regular expressions' "capturing group" feature can also be used to capture, within a group, one or more pieces of text that match additional patterns.This nested pattern capability is used to extract multiple pieces of data from within a group.A regular expression is a text string that is made up of normal characters and special metacharacters.Table 22 shows a partial list of regular expression syntax.• ddd is wind direction expressed as a three-digit value in degrees, while the value is VRB when describing a variable wind direction with a wind speeds of six knots or less.• ff(f) is wind speed expressed in two-or three-digit knots.• Gf m f m (f m ) is the optional gust wind speed expressed with the letter G followed by two-or three-digit knots.• KT is the wind speed unit of measure.• _d n d n d n Vd x d x d x is the variable wind direction range with wind speeds greater than six knots._ is a blank space, d n d n d n is the lower range three-digit degrees, V is an indicator of variable wind direction, and d x d x d x is the upper range three-digit degrees.There are five pieces of data that can be coded in a Wind group.If the coded text strictly follows the above standard coding formats, the regular expression to identify the Wind group and to capture the five pieces of data is:(\d{3}|VRB)(\d{2,3})(?:G(\d{2,3}))?KT(?: (\d{3})V(\d{3}))?When deviations from the standard coding format are taken into account (e.g., insertion of a backslash character "/" between wind direction and wind speed, and a blank space before the text string "KT"), the enhanced regular expression is:(\d{3}|VRB)\/?(\d{2,3})(?:G(\d{2,3}))??KT(?: (\d{3})V(\d{3}))?Table 23 shows the texts matching the enhanced regular expression and the corresponding capturing group in both standard and nonstandard formats.To identify all possible 68 groups found in a METAR, one regular expression needs to be defined for each group.For brevity, the rest of regular expressions are not included in this document.
Groups Containing Plain TextAbout 30 Remarks groups may contain plain text to describe locations, moving directions, and/or general remarks about weather observations.Plain text does not have any recognizable text patterns in the content.Plain text may contain contractions, blank space characters (which are also used for separating groups), and even typos.However, with the exception of the Other Significant Information group, all these Remarks groups do have unique group-markers based on their unique text patterns.Only the Other Significant Information group is composed of plain text entirely, and it can be placed anywhere within a METAR.Any plain text that does not match any of the 58 Remarks groups is categorized as the Other Significant Information group.The Thunderstorm Location group is a good example of a group containing plain text.Its coding format is TS_LOC_(MOV_DIR) where TS is the group indicator, _ is a blank space, LOC is the location of the thunderstorm(s) from the observation station, MOV_DIR is the optional movement with direction, MOV is an indicator, and DIR is the direction.Both LOC and DIR are in plain text.In practice, MOV_DIR may actually is a coded text to describe no or little movement, e.g., "NO MOV", "LTL MOVT", "STATIONARY", or "STNRY".The following regular expression uses its capturing group feature to identify the location and the optional movement with direction:
TS (?:(.+) (MOV .+|LTL MOVT|NO MOV|STATIONARY|STNRY)|(.+))Table 24 shows some examples of the Thunderstorm Location group, where highlighted text belongs to a Thunderstorm Location group, group indicators after the Thunderstorm Location groups are in bold italics, and corresponding capturing groups show locations and movement with directions.That "gap" piece of text usually contains plain text related to the group, but it may also contain information unrelated to the group.For example, consider the report text "... TS ALQDS MOV S MICRO BURST N ... ". "ALQDS MOV S MICRO BURST N" is a "gap" piece of text after the Thunderstorm Location group (indicated by the group-marker "TS")."ALQDS MOV S" is a part of the Thunderstorm Location group because it follows the expected coding format of LOC_(MOV_DIR).A human reader would be able to identify "MICRO BURST N" as a separate weather condition because it is unrelated to the movement of the thunderstorm direction.Furthermore, because it is not a part of any documented group, it should be categorized as the Other Significant Information group instead.For a software-based decoding solution, it would need to be programmed to identify text that describes direction so that unrelated text would not be included.In some actual reports, instead of reporting a movement with direction alone in a Thunderstorm Location group, speed was added (e.g., speed in bold, "TS W-NW MOV SLOLY S", "TS VC NE-S MOV SE SLO").Thus, in order to decode all plain-text-containing Remarks groups correctly, some analysis on the actual reports is required to determine if there is any "extended" coding format for each group.One possible choice is to use a semantic-based text-recognition engine to determine which part of a "gap" piece of text is related to a group of a given coding format.This requires building a rich set of vocabulary for each type of description by reading historical reports.The vocabulary needs to include contractions as well as typos.For simplicity and performance reasons, this document applies a rule-based regular expression to determine which part of the "gap" piece of text is related to a group.
Metadata Structure to Identify GroupA METAR is American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text that is made up of multiple groups separated (ideally) by a blank space character.To identify a group without referencing a semantic library of contractions and sound-alike text, the algorithm presented in this document relies on the use of regular expressions to perform text pattern matching and capturing.Each group in the Body and Remarks sections of a METAR has been assigned a corresponding token as part of the algorithm development.This group token, metarGroups i , has the structure shown in Table 25.To represent all the possible groups in a METAR, an array of the preceding structure is defined as metarGroups.The array includes a special group token to identify the Remarks indicator in a report.This is necessary because there are deviations in coding Remarks (RMK).Examples are /RMK, RMK/, RMK:, RMKS, R_MK, and RM_K where _ is a blank space character.A piece of coded text in a METAR may match multiple candidate groups.For each candidate group, the selection criteria for finding the correctly matched group are: 1. the position of the matched text in the report.2. the matched index to the metarGroups.3. the position of the matched text relative to a RMK indicator in the report.In some situations, there may be multiple candidate groups found at the same position in a report, and the arbitration rule is determined by the matched index to the metarGroups.The lower the matched index value, the higher the precedence order of the group.For example, if FZFG BKN010 is found to be located to the right of RMK in a METAR, FZFG BKN010 matches the Obscurations group and FZFG also matches the Other Significant Information group.When the Obscurations group is placed in a higher precedence order over the Other Significant Information group in metarGroups, the longer text string FZFG BKN010 is matched to the Obscurations group.
Steps in Decoding METARThe minimum desired results of decoding a METAR are a) to identify the groups, and b) to extract the measured values or observation text from each group.Additional derived data can be obtained from these outputs; for example, the ceiling height calculated from a set of sky cover layers and the presences of 43 different weather phenomena in the Body and Remarks section of a report.There are multiple steps in decoding the text of a METAR.Here are the major steps:
Identify All Candidate TokensFor each metarGroups i in metarGroups, use regular expression tokenRegexpT to search in the original METAR text string and find any matched text.Store each of the matched text (the position in the original METAR text string and the length of the matched text), and the matched index to the metarGroups, matchedMetarGroupsIndex, into an array candidateGroups.The candidateGroups array stores all possible group-marker candidates that will be evaluated in subsequent processing steps.In addition, if the Remarks group is found, the position of the Remarks indicator is saved as remarksFirstIndex.
Body Groups Are Not Supposed to Be in the Remarks Section of a ReportTo apply this rule, for each candidate token, candidateGroups i , if the candidate group is one of the Body groups but the matched text is found to the right of Remarks indicator, special reassignment needs to be made.If the candidate token is one of the tokens that have tokenRegexpTGlobal set to be true (e.g., Sky Condition group) and the matched text contains " CB" or " TCU", it is reclassified as Other Significant Information group.Otherwise, the candidate token needs to be removed from the array candidateGroups.
Copy Qualified Tokens From candidateGroups to qualifiedGroupsTo select only the qualified tokens from multiple tokens, first sort the array candidateGroups by the position in the original METAR text string and by matchedMetarGroupsIndex.For each of the sorted candidate tokens in candidateGroups, working from the left to the right of original METAR, a token is qualified if its matched text does not overlap with the previous qualified token.If it is qualified, it is copied to a new array qualifiedGroups.The qualifiedGroups array stores only the qualified group-markers.
Fill in Any Unmatched TextAt the end of the previous step, in the original METAR text string, there may be pieces of texts that do not get assigned to any of the tokens in qualifiedGroups.These "gap" pieces of text, sandwiched between two group-markers, may not match any of the groups or they may be part of the groups containing plain text.For the latter case, each of the group's tokenRegexpE is needed to identify the "extended" text that belongs to the part of the group as described in section 7.3.Depending on how tokenRegexpE is written, the "extended" text may accidentally contain coded text from groups that do not follow their coding formats or from undocumented groups (see section 7.2).For each of the tokens in qualifiedGroups, if the token's tokenRegexpE is defined, the "gap" piece of text immediately after the group's matched text should be evaluated.Any successfully matched text is added to the existing group's matched text.And if the token's tokenRegexpD is defined, the extended matched text will be evaluated to extract any additional information.Any remaining "gap" pieces of text are assigned to the array unknownBodyGroups if they are located to the left of the Remarks indicator, or assigned to the array unknownRemarksGroups if they are located to the right of the Remarks indicator.
Copy Unique Tokens From qualifiedGroups to uniqueGroupsA group may have multiple pieces of matched text that are not contiguous in the original METAR text string (see section 6.4).In order to group all the matched text of a given group, the processing will first sort the array qualifiedGroups by matchedMetarGroupsIndex and by the position in the original METAR text string.For each of the sorted qualified tokens in qualifiedGroups, if two adjacent tokens share the same matchedMetarGroupsIndex, the matched text need to be concatenated and copied to a new array uniqueGroups.
Set Output FieldsAt the end of the previous step, there are three arrays: 1. uniqueGroups is an array of unique groups (Body and Remarks) containing corresponding matched text and any extracted subtext from the matched text.2. unknownBodyGroups is an array of "gap" pieces of text not matching any groups from the Body section of a report.3. unknownRemarksGroups is an array of "gap" pieces of text not matching any groups from the Remarks section of a report.In this step, any desirable output fields can be set by going through the appropriate arrays.Additional derived data can be computed.For example, a ceiling height can be computed by selecting the height of the lowest layer from the Sky Condition group.A Sky Condition group of "FEW 038 SCT 150" has a ceiling height of 3,800 feet.
Software ImplementationThe previous section describes the metadata structure and algorithm for decoding a METAR.This section describes the implementation of the algorithm, which was performed by using Pentaho Data Integration (PDI), an open-source data extraction, transformation, and loading application tool.The core logic of the implementation is written in JavaScript.Within PDI, the JavaScript code is automatically compiled to byte-code by using an embedded Java-based JavaScript engine, Rhino, another open-source Mozilla project.The compilation of the JavaScript code to byte-code is set at the highest optimization of 9.This implementation also calculates the local time of a report given its UTC time, the UTC time zone offset of the airport where the report is submitted, and whether daylight savings time is observed at the airport.Decoded METARs are saved into an Oracle database.This database is part of the ATM NextGen Data Warehouse at NASA Ames [12].The schema of the database table for METARs is described in the section 9. Figure 3 shows the PDI implementation, which includes the step of saving the decoded data into an Oracle database.Figure 3. METAR decoding and subsequent storage into database implemented using Pentaho Data Integration.A test was performed to see how well the decoding algorithm performs.The test was performed on a server with the following hardware specifications:
Storing Decoded METARs Into a Relational DatabaseIn a METAR, there are 69 groups.Some of the groups can be further normalized from a relational database modeling standpoint.For example, in the Body section, these groups can be normalized:• Runway Visual Range group: for each runway, the visual range.• Present Weather group: for each weather phenomenon, the respective intensity, proximity, and descriptor.• Sky Condition group: for each layer, the sky cover and respective altitude.In the Remarks section, the text of many groups can be normalized.In the current design, no normalization is made, and only the raw text of each group is saved to the database.When there are multiple observations coded in a group, only the first observation is further decoded.For example, the Lightning group may contain multiple lightning observations.The frequency, lightning type, and location of only the first lightning observation from the group are decoded and saved into the database.Future enhancements to the current design can include further normalizations.Figure 4 illustrates the relational model of the METAR table (ODS_METAR_REPORTS) and the Airport table (ODS_AIRPORTS).ODS_AIRPORTS stores information about an airport per row and its primary key is AIRPORT_ID.ODS_METAR_REPORTS stores one METAR per row and its composite primary key is REPORT_DATE_TIME_UTC and STATION_ID.The column STATION_ID from ODS_METAR_REPORTS is a foreign key to ODS_AIRPORTS.The relationship between these two tables is "Each METAR must reference one and only airport."To facilitate a faster search of data in the database, ODS_METAR_REPORTS also contains Boolean type of data indicating the presence of 43 weather phenomena in the Body section and in the Remarks section.
Aggregating Daily Decoded METARsBoth weather and air traffic at an airport have a 24-hour cycle pattern.To facilitate search and reporting of weather aggregated to a daily level, METARs at each airport are aggregated from the respective local time instead of the UTC time of their reports.Star Schema Dimensional Modeling [13] is also used to model the daily aggregated observations.See Figure 5 A typical characteristic to Star Schema Dimensional Modeling is the large ratio of the number of rows in the Fact table to the number of rows from any of the related dimensional tables.This dimensional modeling approach is optimal for querying a large amount of data in the shortest amount of time.This simple model also allows a user to understand the relationships.There is one, and only one, simple join from a dimension to a fact table.By using any ad-hoc query tools, a user can specify any descriptive columns from any dimensional tables and any quantitative columns from a fact table to filter or to report in a query.
Reporting on Decoded METARsFor the users of the ATM NextGen Data Warehouse at NASA Ames, a web-based reporting system was built to access the data in the Oracle database.The reporting system was built using the Oracle Application Express application.A user can specify basic search criteria to create a report.Built-in features of the Oracle Application Express allow a user to further filter, sort, and format data.Figure 6 shows a sample of a METAR daily summary report.The search criteria are: a list of airports, a list of weather phenomena observed during the day, minimum wind gust, minimum wind speed, average wind speed, lowest ceiling height, lowest visibility, and date range or a set of dates.A user can click on a link to drill down to the detailed METARs on any given day at an airport.Figure 7 shows a sample of a METAR details report.The search criteria are a list of airports and a date range or a set of dates.A user can further filter, sort, and download the data by using built-in action menu options.Charts can also be created.Figure 8 shows charts of the number of days in which there were wind gusts and wind speeds exceeding 25 knots at selected airports.Note that at 02:51Z and 0253Z, dust storms at vicinity were already observed and were reported in the Remarks section.
Ground Stop Advisory # 17 on August 19, 2011, UTCTable 28 shows the detailed observations made at the Phoenix airport relative to when the Ground Stop advisory began and when the Ground Stop message was sent.
Significance of Blowing Widespread Dust Referenced in the Remarks SectionFrom these four sets of METARs, one can notice that a dust storm at the airport may be preceded by a dust storm between 5 to 10 statute miles from KPHX, blowing widespread dust (BLDU), and/or a wind speed of 20 or more knots.There are other observations such as temperature and humidity in the reports that are not listed in the preceding tables.To develop a predictive model of whether a Ground Stop advisory (or Ground Delay Program) will be issued, all candidate input parameters should be fed into the model.If the model is reliable, it can prune the parameters and identify the influential ones.The input parameters in this case should include information from the METARs, Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) reports, and air traffic operational data.The construction of this predictive model is a separate research project and it is not covered in this document.But if the predictive model should ever be constructed, information from the METARs should obviously include BLDU.There are three possible groups in which BLDU can be reported in a METAR, and BLDU may be reported in multiple groups within a METAR:• Present Weather group in the Body section, e.g., "BLDU".• Obscuration group in the Remarks section, an obscuration code followed by a sky cover amount, e.g., "BLDU FEW023".• Other Significant Information group in the Remarks section, an obscuration code not followed by a sky cover amount, e.g., "BLDU ALQDS".METARs that had BLDU reported between October 2009 and January 2014 at the Phoenix airport were analyzed.Figure 9 describes, via a Venn diagram, the number of METARs categorized by the three groups that had BLDU reported.There are 294 reports referencing BLDU in total.Among them, 174 reports (59 percent) have BLDU referenced in the Body section only and in both Body and Remarks sections; 120 reports (41percent) have BLDU referenced in the Remarks section only.Figure 10 shows these two sets of reports broken down by years.The annual percentage of reports that have BLDU referenced in the Remarks section only ranges from 29 percent in 2012 to 58 percent in 2013.This shows that reporting BLDU in the Remarks section only is not an isolated case in some distant past.These two figures show that the Remarks section of a METAR is a significant source of weather conditions.In addition to BLDU, there are other qualitative and quantitative observations that can be extracted from the Remarks section.In conclusion, ignoring any of these observations located in the Remarks section can result in an incomplete or inaccurate model.
Further Potential WorksThe completely decoded METARs in the ATM NextGen Data Warehouse are valuable to ATM research.Weather conditions that are described in the Body as well as the Remarks sections are now accessible to researchers.The study of adverse weather conditions at airports, weather forecasts, air traffic operation data, and the probability of subsequent Air Traffic Management Initiatives being issued by ATCSCC is a potential project.Results from the study may help to prove the significance of adverse weather conditions found only in the Remarks section.Because many of the deviations from the standard coding formats are likely to be caused by a human observer, a software tool should be developed to assist the observer before a METAR is disseminated.Mistakes such as a missing blank space character in a fraction could have been avoided if such a tool exists.As a minimum, the tool should validate a METAR so that any deviations are immediately identified to the observer prior to dissemination of the METAR.
ConclusionsBoth the Body and Remarks sections of a METAR contain important surface weather observations at an airport.Some observations such as lightning are only available in the Remarks section of a report.Due to manual editing, an observer may enter some important observations in the Remarks section instead of the Body section of a METAR.Any analysis involving surface weather observations from the METARs should not rely solely on the information from the Body section of the reports; ignoring information from the Remarks section may lead to incomplete or inaccurate results.This document identifies major deviations from the group coding formats found in 12 million METARs.The algorithm for decoding 11 groups from the Body section and 58 groups from the Remarks section accounts for these deviations.The algorithm uses regular expressions to perform text pattern matching to identify all the groups in a METAR.Because there is no unique character separating groups in a METAR, the algorithm for decoding METARs is by no means perfect.Because no semantic analysis is used in the algorithm, when decoding groups that can contain plain text, in special circumstances, the algorithm can treat some unknown coded text as plain text of an identified group instead.Only a sophisticated semantic analysis of plain text can decipher and determine which part of the plain text describes an observation (e.g., detailed description, location, and moving direction of a weather phenomenon).When the implemented software was used to decode 12 million METARs, a sustained rate of about 10,000 reports per second was achieved.Thus, any real-time system can also use this algorithm to decode a METAR and to extract the specific information it needs.Daily METARs are decoded and stored in the ATM NextGen Data Warehouse database at NASA AmesFigure 1 .1Figure 1.Number of METARs by airports: thunderstorms referenced in the Remarks section only.................................................................................................................

For example, the Wind group in the Body part of a METAR has the standard coding format ofdddff(f)Gf m f m (f m )KT_d n d n d n Vd x d x dx where:
For example, KDFW has a time zone offset of -7, and it observes daylight savings time.A METAR from KDFW at 2009-10-25 04:53 UTC has a local time of 2009-10-24 23:53.

1. NOAA's METAR files from the last 24 hours are stored at NOAA's file transfer protocol (FTP) site: ftp://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/cycles/ 2. Historical METARs are available from the Weather Underground web site:http://www.wunderground.com 3. NOAA's Aviation Digital Data Service (ADDS) provides a Web Services interface to get the last 141 hours of METARs: http://www.aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserverADDS provides decoded METAR but not all the groups in a METAR are decoded.Only 31 fields are available
The daily archiving of the historical METARs commenced on October 15, 2009, and continues today.METARs up to February 4, 2014, are used in this document.There are 12,046,057 METARs collected from 267 airports over 1,575 days.This translates to an average of 28.65 reports per airport per day.Because METARs are disseminated on a regular hourly schedule, the extra 4.65 reports can be explained by the dissemination of unscheduled special METARs.

6.2 Standard Coding Format Not Followed SomeMETARs do not follow the coding format of a group.The result from the analysis of the 12 million METARs shows that 31 of the 69 groups deviate from their respective standard coding formats.Without knowing what those deviations are, groups that do not conform to the standard coding formats will not be identified correctly in a report.For example, the Peak Wind group has the coding format of PK WND dddff(f)/(hh)mm whereddd is the direction of the peak wind, ff(f) is the 2-or 3-digit peak wind speed in knots since thelast METAR, and (hh)mm is the time of occurrence. A peak wind of 39 knots from 100 degreesthat occurred at 0746Z would be coded "PK WND 10039/0746". Table 3 shows examples ofdeviations found in the Peak Wind group.Temperature and Dew Point, and Altimeter groups are commonly reported in the METARs.Their coding formats are T
'T'/T' d T' d and AP H P H P H P H respectively. T'T' is a two-digit numbertemperature in Celsius and T' d T' d is a two-digit number dew point in Celsius. A is the Altimetergroup indicator and P H P H P H P H is a four-digit number indicating the altimeter setting of tens,units, tenths, and hundredths of inches of mercury. Table 4 shows some deviations fromstandard coding formats.

• Dual 12-core Xenon processors • 94 GB memory; maximum memory allocation of 4 GB is set for PDI To perform the test, 12 million METARs, from 267 airports over 1,575 days, were fed into this METAR decoding step without the saving-data-to-database step.The METAR decoding step was configured to run in 14 concurrent threads.The decoding of the entire 12 million reports finished in about 20 minutes, which translates to a sustained rate of about 10,000 reports per second.In other words, the 267 hourly METARs submitted from the 267 airports can be decoded in about 27 milliseconds.
. All quantitative measurements from METARs are stored in the Fact table called F_METAR_REPORT_DAILY_AGG.The dimensional key LTZ_DATE_ID is the date (local time) reference to the Dimensional table D_Date; the dimensional key AIRPORT_ID is the airport reference to the Dimension table D_AIRPORT; and the dimensional key WX_PHENOMENA_ID is the aggregated weather reference to the Dimensional table D_WX_PHENOMENA.Each row in D_WX_PHENOMENA is a combination of weather phenomena reported in a 24-hour period.
12 Case Study of Dust Storm and Ground Stop at Phoenix Airport Adust storm is a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions.High winds and very low visibility caused by dust storms have significant impact on air traffic operations such as departures and arrivals.It is of interest to investigate how METARs can predict restrictions in air traffic operations, to perhaps develop predictive models of operational impacts.METARs between October 2009 and January 2014 show four dust storms at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Arizona (KPHX).Each one of the reported dust storms had subsequent Ground Stop advisories issued by the ATCSCC.Departure flights from affected Centers to KPHX were halted as a result.Table26shows these Ground Stop advisories.
