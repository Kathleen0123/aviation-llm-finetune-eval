Section 3 formulates the optimal control model; Section 4 derives the analytical formula for the speed profile; Section 5 applies the formula to an actual arrival route and compares the minimum-cost trajectory to that of a simulated flight; Section 6 summarizes the findings and discusses the potential applications of the minimum-cost speed profile.
Background
Minimum-Cost DescentAn arrival flight transitions from cruise to descent at a distance of 100 to 150 nmi from the destination airport.In the absence of wind and altitude restrictions, the most fuelefficient operation for an arrival flight is to maintain at the best-range speed in cruise until the top-of-descent point for an idle-thrust descent at the aircraft's minimum-drag speed [20].However, airlines can save time-related costs by flying an aircraft faster to the destination airport.If time saving is the sole objective, the ideal cruise and descent speeds would be the maximum speeds allowable by the aircraft performance envelope.In actual operations, airlines consider both fuel and time costs and the minimum-cost speeds lie between these two extremes.The relative importance of expediency to fuel is modeled by the Cost Index, a parameter selected by airlines during flight planning.The Cost Index varies from route to route and from aircraft type to aircraft type [21].A zero Cost Index represents the case in which flight time does not contribute to the cost.A large Cost Index represents that expediency is more important than fuel.
Arrival ProcedureIn the United States, arrival flights to major airports follow published arrival procedures called the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR).While current STARs do not connect the route all the way to the runway threshold, they are expected to be extended to the runway in the near future to support trajectory-based operations [1].For the rest of the paper, it is assumed that a specific route is defined for an arrival flight all the way to the runway threshold.The aircraft descent trajectory considered in this work begins from the first altitude restriction along the arrival route and ends at the initial approach fix that is usually 5 to 10 nmi from the airport.The total path distance of the trajectory is between 50 and 100 nmi.3 An Optimal Control Model for Aircraft Descent
Modeling AssumptionsThe following assumptions are made throughout this section, grouped here by the different aspects of the operation.1. Route geometry: The descent trajectory is modeled as a continuous curve in 3dimensional airspace, parameterized by the ground path distance.
Aircraft kinematics and kinetics:(a) The aircraft is modeled as a point mass.(b) The weight of the aircraft is treated as a constant.(c) The thrust acts along the direction of the flight path.(d) Fuel flow is linear with thrust.
Flight conditions:(a) The wind velocity is constant in time.Crosswind and vertical wind are small compared to the airspeed and, therefore, is neglected.(b) Both the inertial and aerodynamic flight path angles are small enough that their cosines are assumed to equal 1.
Model FormulationLet x denote the ground path distance of the aircraft's position along the coordinate defined by the horizontal path.By assumption (1), the altitude h of the aircraft, the air density ρ, and inertial flight path angle, γ i , of the aircraft can each be represented as a function of x alone,h = h(x),(1)ρ = ρ(x), tan γ i = dh dx .The last equation is based on the sign convention that γ i is negative for descent.Let V = V (t) denote the speed of the aircraft with respect to the air, i.e., the true airspeed.In the following sections, speed refers to the true airspeed unless noted otherwise.The wind along the route is denoted byw = w(x)(2)and, by assumption (3a), is independent of time.By assumption (3b), the difference between the horizontal component of the true airspeed and the true airspeed itself is ignored:V horiz ∼ V w horiz ∼ wIn the following state equations, T denotes thrust, D drag, γ a the aerodynamic flight path angle, W the aircraft's weight, g the gravity of Earth, and the dot over a symbol denotes differentiation with respect to time:ẋ = V + w,(3a)V = g T -D W -sin γ a -(V + w) dw dx ,(3b)where D = D(x, V ) and x = x(t).The right-hand side of Eq. (3b) consists of forces from the thrust, drag, gravity, and the inertial force as a result of wind.Note the use of assumptions (2b) and (2c) in Eq. (3b).The FPAs γ a and γ i are related byḣ = V sin γ a = (V + w) sin γ i .(4)The use of γ a in the state equations has been preferred to that of γ i for brevity.The aircraft's total engine thrust is bounded,T min ≤ T ≤ T max ,with the bounds determined by the engine's performance envelope.The objective to be minimized is the direct operating cost, which is a sum of two terms corresponding to fuel and flight duration, respectively:J = t f 0      Fuel p f × c f × [T (t) -T min ] + f 0 + Time p f × r      dt.(5)Here, t f stands for the arrival time at the end of the route, p f the fuel price, c f the thrust-specific fuel consumption, f 0 the minimum-thrust fuel rate, and r a constant Cost Index [20].In what follows, it will be convenient to combine the drag, gravity, and wind gradient into the "effective drag per unit mass",D = g W (D + W sin γ a ) + (V + w) dw dx ,(6)and to normalize thrust to a "thrust per unit mass",T = g W T.(7)These definitions simplify the state equations toẋ = V + w,(8a)V = T -D(8b)The optimal control problem central to this paper is the problem with state variables x and V , control variable T , state equations ( 8), initial time t = 0, final time t f free, boundary conditionsx(0) = x i , V (0) = V i , x(t f ) = x f , V (t f ) = V f ,            (9) control constraints T min ≤ T ≤ T max ,(10)and the objective to minimize being the normalized cost per unit aircraft mass:J = t f 0 c f T (t) + r dt, where r = g W (-c f T min + f 0 + r) .(11)4 An Analytical Optimal Solution in Feedback Form
Comparison of Two Feasible State TrajectoriesThe optimal control problem ( 8), ( 9), ( 10), (11) has two state variables and one control variable which, furthermore, enters the state equations and the cost linearly.This special form of the problem allows one to find optimal control strategies using a technique based on Green's Theorem; see, e.g., [22].This technique consists of comparing two feasible (i.e., compliant with ( 8), ( 9), ( 10), but possibly suboptimal) state trajectories for performance.Let Γ 1 = (x 1 (t), V 1 (t)), 0 ≤ t ≤ t 1 f , and Γ 2 = (x 2 (t), V 2 (t)), 0 ≤ t ≤ t 2 f ,be two feasible state trajectories corresponding to control strategies T 1 (t) and T 2 (t) with generally different final times.The respective operating costs (11) of the two trajectories can be briefly writtenJ k = t f k 0 c f T k (t) + r dt, k = 1, 2.The direct operating cost can be written as a path integral, along the state trajectory, of a differential form P (x, V ) dx + M (x, V ) dV (derived explicitly in Appendix A), i.e.,J k = Γ k [P (x, V ) dx + M (x, V ) dV ] , k = 1, 2. (12)At constant airspeed, i.e. dV = 0, the quantity P has the interpretation of steady-state cost per unit ground path distance.The differenceJ 1 -J 2(13)is the difference in performance between the two state trajectories.Henceforth, assume that the two trajectories share no other states besides (x i , V i ) and (x f , V f ).This assumption, which entails no loss of generality but simplifies analysis, implies that Γ 1 and reverseoriented Γ 2 together constitute a closed contour [23], denoted here by Γ 1 ∪ -Γ 2 and, for definiteness, assumed oriented counter-clockwise.See Figure 1 for a notional illustration.Expression ( 13) can be written as a path integral along the aforementioned closed contour:Γ 1 ∪-Γ 2 (P dx + M dV ) .By Green's Theorem, the latter integral can be written as an integral over the area A enclosed and oriented by the contour:A ∂M ∂x - ∂P ∂V dx dV.(14)The two state trajectories can now be compared for performance by using the knowledgex V P f P i Г 2 Г 1 I = I(x, V) A Γ Γ Figure 1.Green's Theorem predicts J 1 < J 2 if I < 0 everywhere in the enclosed area; and J 1 > J 2 if I > 0 everywhere in the enclosed area.of the integrandI ≡ ∂M ∂x - ∂P∂V to examine the sign of the difference (13).In particular, if I is nonnegative in and on the boundary of A, then Γ 2 performs as well as does Γ 1 or better.Consequently, a comparison of two feasible state trajectories reduces to an examination of the sign of I in the appropriate regions of the state space.This examination will now be carried out.By the derivation in Appendix A,P = c f D + r V + w , M = c f ,(15)and, consequently,I = ∂c f ∂x - ∂ ∂V c f D + r V + w .For typical commercial aircraft and descent FPAs, c f does not vary substantially with the ground path distance.Therefore, the first term on the right hand side can be ignored without noticeable effects on the results, i.e.,I - ∂ ∂V c f D + r V + w . (16)For aircraft with typical drag formulas (described in detail below) and, within the range of airspeeds considered, one finds that the zero-level set [I = 0] is the graph of a function V mc (x) called the minimum-cost speed.The subscript mc stands for minimum cost because∂P ∂V V =Vmc = 0and∂ 2 P ∂V 2 > 0,(17)which will be shown at the end of this section.It follows thatI(x, V )    < 0 if V > V mc (x), = 0 if V = V mc (x), > 0 if V < V mc (x). (18)To conclude the section, we justify stipulation (17).A typical drag polar [24] for modeling drag isD = 1 2 ρV 2 SC D = 1 2 ρV 2 S C d0 + KC L 2 ,where C L denotes the lift coefficient, C D the drag coefficient, C d0 the zero-lift drag coefficient, K the lift drag constant, S the aircraft's wing area, and ρ = ρ(x) the air density.Replacing C L with its definition [24],L = W 1 + V 4 g 2 R 2 = 1 2 ρV 2 SC L ,where R is the instantaneous turn radius, the drag can be writtenD = 1 2 ρV 2 SC d0 + KW 2 1 2 ρV 2 S 1 + V 4 g 2 R 2 .(19)Equations ( 6), ( 16), (19) and the dependency of D on V together imply thatI ∼        - g 2W ρSC d0 - 2KW ρSgR 2 < 0, for a large V, 6KW gρSV 4 > 0, for a small V.(20)It can also be shown that∂ 2 P ∂V 2 = - ∂I ∂V = 24KW gρV 5 S > 0, if w = r = 0. (21)Results ( 20) and ( 21) together imply (18).Numerical evidence obtained for the case when w and r have realistic nonzero values suggests that the inequality in Eq. ( 21) always holds for the range of V considered, hence confirming (17) and (18).
Optimal State Trajectories and Control StrategiesThe following observation will be instrumental throughout this section: the curve in the state space traversed by a feasible state trajectory (x(t), V (t)) can be parameterized by x instead of by t; i.e., can be viewed as the graph of a function V = V (x).This follows from the fact that, by dividing Eq. (8b) by Eq. (8a), one obtainsdV dx = T -D V + w is finite.Therefore, in what follows, whenever convenient, a state trajectory (x(t), V (t)) will be treated as a function V = V (x) without further explanation.The following lemma is a direct consequence of the results of Section 4.1.The five parts of the lemma are illustrated, respectively, by the five panels of Figure 2. It will be convenient to use the control-theoretic terms of admissibility [25] and attainability: A control value T satisfying ( 10) is said to be admissible.This term will be applied as well to a control strategy with the value T (t) admissible at every t.A state trajectory corresponding to an admissible control strategy will be referred to as attainable.The last part of the following lemma addresses the situation when not all segments of [I = 0] are attainable trajectories.Lemma 1 Consider an initial state a = (x a , V a ) and a final state b = (x b , V b ), with x a < x b .For (a) through (d), consider two attainable state trajectories (x 1 (t), V 1 (t)) and (x 2 (t), V 2 (t)) that have the same initial state a and the same final state b: The optimal trajectory described in the last part, (e), of the Lemma is completely determined by the point of intersection (the gray dot in Fig. 2(e)) between a b and trajectory a 1 b 1 ; i.e., by the choice of that state on a b which minimizes the cost of getting from a to b.Since segment a b is closed and bounded, such a state necessarily exists.(a) If a is above [I = 0], b is on [I = 0],andV mc (x) ≤ V 1 (x) ≤ V 2 (x) for x a ≤ x ≤ x b , then V 1 (x) outperforms V 2 (x). (This is because the integrand I in the area A enclosed by Γ 1 ∪ -Γ 2 is negative.) (b) If a is below [I = 0], b is on [I = 0],andV 2 (x) ≤ V 1 (x) ≤ V mc (x) for x a ≤ x ≤ x b , then V 1 (x) outperforms V 2 (x). (c) If a is on [I = 0], b is above [I = 0],andV mc (x) ≤ V 1 (x) ≤ V 2 (x) for x a ≤ x ≤ x b , then V 1 (x) outperforms V 2 (x). (d) If a is on [I = 0], b is below [I = 0],andV 2 (x) ≤ V 1 (x) ≤ V mc (x) for x a ≤ x ≤ x b , then V 1 (x) outperforms V 2 (x).In summary, the optimal trajectory goes towards [I = 0] as rapidly as possible, as in Figure 2(a) and 2(b), and leaves [I = 0] as late as possible, as in Figure 2(c) and 2(d).This observation along with Eq. (8b) suggests that extreme values of T must be used in getting the optimal trajectory to or from [I = 0].That the optimal trajectory must, in fact, use T min or T max when it is not on the [I = 0] curve, can be proved using the Hamiltonian [26] of the problem,H = c f T + c i + λ x (V + w) + λ s T -D ,(22)where λ x and λ s are the respective costate variables of x and V .The optimal control minimizes (per the sign convention in [26]) the Hamiltonian at every point of the trajectory.The Hamiltonian H is linear in T and is minimized by:T = T min if ∂H ∂T > 0 T max if ∂H ∂T < 0. (23)If ∂H/∂T = 0, then the optimal control is on a singular arc [26].The curve [I = 0] turns out to be the singular arc of the Hamiltonian.In particular, for an optimal trajectory passing through a state in I < 0 and later intersecting [I = 0], as in Lemma 1(a), the optimal control at that state is T min .Similarly, for a state on an optimal trajectory passing through a state in I > 0 and later intersecting [I = 0], as in Lemma 1(b), the optimal control at that state is T max .This classification of optimal control strategies can also be carried out by more elementary means, without involving the Hamiltonian formalism, but expending more verbiage.This simpler approach to optimal control classification is presented in Appendix B.
Control on the Minimum-Cost Speed CurveThe control that keeps the aircraft on the minimum-cost speed curve, T mc , is computed here by setting the right-hand side of Eq. ( 16) to zero and using the state equations (8).For convenience, define Ĩ ≡ (V + w) 2 I.Since (V + w) is never zero in the range of airspeed and wind considered, the curves [I = 0] and [ Ĩ = 0] coincide.The following equality holds on [ Ĩ = 0]:d V d x Ĩ=0 = - ∂ Ĩ ∂V -1 ∂ Ĩ ∂x .(25)DefiningF ≡ c f D,(a)V mc (x)I < 0 I > 0 x V a b V 1 (x)(b)V mc (x)  24) and ( 16) into the right-hand side of Eq. ( 25), one obtainsI < 0 I > 0 x V a b V 1 (x) (c) V mc (x) I < 0 I > 0 x V a b V 1 (x) (d) V mc (x) I < 0 I > 0 x V a b V 1 (x) (e) V mc (x) I < 0 I > 0 x Vd V d x Ĩ=0 = (V + w) ∂ 2 F ∂V 2 -1 - ∂F ∂V dw dx + ∂F ∂x -(V + w) ∂ 2 F ∂x ∂V ,(26)From Eqs. ( 8) and ( 26), one obtainsT mc = D + ∂ 2 F ∂V 2 -1 - ∂F ∂V dw dx + ∂F ∂x -(V + w) ∂ 2 F ∂x ∂V . (27)With analytic expressions for the drag and the wind, the right-hand side of Eq. ( 27) can be evaluated for specific values of x and V .The thrust T mc on [I = 0] is given byT mc = W g T mc .The thrust T mc computed using Eq. ( 27) can turn out to violate the admissibility condition (10) on an interval of the x-axis, leading to the situation of Lemma 1(e).In this case, the optimal trajectory leaves the minimum-cost speed curve with an extremal value of thrust until it either rejoins the minimum-cost speed curve or reaches the final state.
V mc with Constant c f and without WindThe content of this section is a number of consequences derived from the above results for the special case when c f is assumed constant, and wind speed assumed is zero at all altitudes.Under the assumption of constant c f , Eq. ( 24) simplifies toĨ = -(V + w) 2 c f ∂ ∂V D + r/c f V + w = 0. (28)Furthermore, if the wind effect is negligible, thenĨ = -V 2 c f ∂ ∂V D + r/c f V = 0. (29)By using Eqs.( 6) and ( 19) to model the drag, Eq. ( 29) is solved analytically for V .The minimum-cost speed is found to beV mc (x) 2 = (W/S) C d0 ρ(x) α + α 2 + 12KC d0 . (30)Here α = sin γ i + r c f g captures the combined effect of the FPA and of the Cost Index on the minimum-cost speed, In particular, α increases with r and with γ i in a neighborhood of γ i = 0. Equality (30) has the following interpretations and implications * The minimum-cost speed V mc can be regarded as a modified best-range speed modulated by the factor α.For a flight segment which is level (i.e., with FPA zero) and has a zero Cost Index, the resulting special case α = 0 corresponds to an V mc equal to the best-range speed at an altitude specified by h(x) [24].* The minimum-cost speed V mc (x) decreases with altitude due to air density change.* The minimum-cost speed V mc (x) increases with α, which means V mc increases with γ i and with the Cost Index.5 Case Study: GEELA Arrival Route to the Phoenix Airport
Route Definition and Test ConditionsThis section investigates the sensitivity of the optimal speed profile to the wind condition and Cost Index, explores the effects of certain modeling assumptions on the fuel computation, and compares the computed optimal trajectory to a simulated flight trajectory.The specific example of an arrival procedure used as a basis for this section is a portion of the GEELA route from waypoint HYDRR to waypoint PHX08 (runway 8) of the Phoenix Airport. 3igure 3 shows the waypoints and altitude restrictions specified in this procedure.The coordinates X fe and Y fe in Fig. 3 increase Eastward and Northward, respectively.Note that the origin of the coordinates is arbitrary, since this figure is mainly for demonstrating the scale of an arrival route.This procedure is closely based on current operations but has additional waypoints to precisely guide the arrival flights all the way to the runway.This procedure has been used in simulations conducted to test arrival management technologies [3].The ground path distance of the entire route was constructed by connecting consecutive waypoints' positions and span roughly 54 nmi.The coordinate x, representing the ground path distance, starts negative and increases to 0 at the runway threshold.Turns were modeled as having a five nautical mile turn radius each.This approximate treatment of the turns decoupled the horizontal path from the speed.Lift was treated approximately as being equal to the aircraft weight all the time.These approximations have been used by trajectory generators of the ground automation systems [27].Figure 4 shows the modeled altitude h(x) of the GEELA route.The FPA is modeled as a constant on each segment between two consecutive waypoints, except varying near the waypoint so as to remain continuous.This change of FPA takes place after the aircraft has crossed the waypoint.A fixed change rate of ±1 • per nmi was used to model these transient segments.The air density was a function of the altitude computed from the standard atmosphere model.It was 0.778 kg 3 /m at the beginning of the descent and 1.187 kg 3 /m at the end.The initial airspeed at the waypoint HYDRR, V i , for the aircraft was chosen to be the calibrated airspeed (CAS) [24] of 260 knots (174.7 m/sec), required at HYDRR by the  Boeing 737-800 aircraft type was modeled using the Base of Aircraft Database (BADA) 3.8 [28].Flap schedule was not considered and only the clean configuration was used.The minimum-cost speed curve, V mc (x) (see Fig. 2), was computed using Eq. ( 28) for the entire range of x.Substituting Eq. ( 19) into Eq.( 28), a 5th-order polynomial in V was obtained whose coefficients depended on x.The polynomial reduces to 4th order when w = 0, in which case V mc can be computed from Eq. (30).In all test conditions, one and only one real root between V i and V f was found for each x.The optimal control strategy were applied to four benchmark conditions, labeled as Min-Fuel, Headwind, Tailwind, and Fuel-and-Time.These conditions differ only in the choice of wind function and Cost Index, listed in Table 1 and justified in the following sections.Table 1.Parameters that define the four benchmark conditions.

( 5)) w(x) (knots; x in nmi) r ($/hr / (cents / lb))Min-Fuel 0 0 Headwind -3.79 + 0.226x 0 Tailwind 1.03 -0.301x 0 Fuel-and-Time 0 30  In all conditions, the initial airspeed is above the minimum-cost speed and the final airspeed is below the minimum-cost speed, corresponding to Lemma 1(a) and 1(c), respectively.The discussion in Section 4.2 indicates that an extreme value of thrust, T min , must be used in the initial and final phases of the state trajectory.The speeds for those phases were found by integrating the state equations with that value of thrust forward from the first two boundary conditions of (9) and backward from the last two boundary conditions of (9).The integration was carried out numerically using MATLAB's [29] ode45 function.The thrust T mc was computed as a function of x using Eq. ( 27).Table 2 summarizes the flight times and fuel burn obtained for the four conditions.Details of the control strategy and speed profile will be discussed for each condition in the following sections.
Min-Fuel Condition: No Wind, No Time CostFigure 5(a) shows the optimal speed profile.The thin line represents the minimum-cost speed, V mc .Q 1 and Q 2 stand for points that join a T min speed profile with a T mc speed profile.The value V mc was computed essentially from Eq. (30).The rapid changes of V mc at some values of x were due to change of the FPA before and after a waypoint.The general trend was that V mc increased with increasing (shallower) γ i .For example, the increase of V mc near x = -34 nmi corresponded to the waypoint of PUNNT.Between PUNNT and TEICH, the FPA was shallower than before PUNNT (see Fig. 4), resulting in higher values of V mc .shows T as a function of x, which has non-zero thrust during the period of time when the trajectory follows the minimum-cost speed curve.The thrust for this period of time was equal to T mc .Shallower FPAs result in higher values of T mc (e.g., on the segment from PUNNT to TEICH; ).This corresponds to the physical intuition that a shallower descent does not convert as much potential energy to kinetic energy to compensate for the drag and therefore must use more thrust instead.The speed profile shown in Fig. 5 turns out to be unattainable near x = -24 nmi and near x = -20 nmi.This situation corresponds to Lemma 1(e).In physical flight control, the effect of negative thrust could have been attained by using speed brakes.This use, however, would not result in the reduction of cost (11) as would negative thrust.In this model, the trajectory segment is computed, following the notation in Lemma 1(e), by iterating through possible segments of a 1 b 1 until the minimum cost between ab is obtained.As expected, the actual optimal speed has a flatter |dV /dx| than that of |dV mc /dx| on these segments.
Headwind and Tailwind ConditionsThe main purpose of studying these two wind conditions is to understand the effect of wind variation on the optimal control strategy and the resulting speed profile.To select representative winds conditions, winds along the GEELA route were computed using the two-hour look-ahead time, 40-km Rapid Update Cycle weather forecast [30] for year 2011.Twenty-four forecast winds were generated for each day on an hourly basis.Daily averages were computed for every day of year 2011 at the waypoints PUNNT and PHX08, two of the waypoints on the GEELA route (see Fig. 3).Figure 6 shows the daily averages of the along-the-route components of wind at PUNNT and PHX08.The wind components for PUNNT and PHX08 were computed at 10,000 ft and 1,111 ft, respectively.The data indicated predominantly tailwinds for PUNNT all year long.Wind components at PHX08 were smaller in magnitude and varied somewhat by the season.The Headwind and Tailwind conditions were selected from the two days of year 2011 that had the most negative and positive wind gradients, dw/dx, respectively.The Headwind condition was defined based on February 3's average wind, which had the most negative wind gradient.Both PUNNT and PHX08 experienced headwinds along the route on February 3.The Tailwind condition was defined based on February 19's average wind, which had the most positive wind gradient.Both PUNNT and PHX08 experienced tailwinds along the route on February 19.The wind gradient was assumed to be constant throughout the path, and was computed by dividing the difference of the wind components at PHX08 and PUNNT by the ground path distance between these two waypoints.The resulting wind functions are listed in Table 1.The optimal speed profile and control strategy for the Headwind condition are shown in Fig. 7.The wind perturbed the minimum-cost speed curve noticeably, increasing V mc by 16 knots at the beginning (x i ) of the trajectory and by only 4 knots at the end of the trajectory.The initial and final arcs descended faster in speed (more negative dV mc /dx), causing the aircraft to stay longer on the minimum-cost speed curve than in the Min-Fuel condition.The thrust on the minimum-cost speed curve increased slightly when compared to the Min-Fuel condition.For transient segments on which the FPA increases rapidly around x = -34 nmi, the thrust takes relatively high values.The optimal speed profile for the Tailwind condition is shown in Fig. 8(a).The wind perturbed the minimum-cost speed curve in the opposition direction, decreasing V mc by 15 knots of V mc at the beginning of the trajectory and by only 1 knot at the end of the trajectory.Fig. 8(b) shows the T min arcs descended slower in speed, causing the aircraft to stay only a short distance on the minimum-cost speed curve.The thrust on the minimumcost speed curve decreased slightly compared to the Min-Fuel condition.The effect of wind on the minimum-cost speed is consistent with the dependency of the best-range speed on winds [24]: higher for headwind and lower for tailwind.Comparing the fuel burn to the Min-Fuel condition, the trajectory for the Headwind condition burns 36 lb more fuel while the trajectory for the Tailwind condition burns 31 lb less fuel (see Table 2).
Fuel-and-Time ConditionThe Fuel-and-Time condition considered both fuel and time costs.The Cost Index selected by airlines varies greatly from route to route and among aircraft types [20].For B737, a typical value [20,31] of r = 30 $/hr cents $/lb was used for the analysis.The fuel price, p f , was chosen to be 0.43 ($/lb).The optimal speed profile for the Fuel-and-Time condition is shown in Fig. 9(a).Compared to the Min-Fuel condition, the minimum-cost speed curve moves toward higher speeds significantly.This is because the aircraft must fly faster in order to reduce the time cost at the expense of the fuel cost.The minimum-cost speed curve was reached here much earlier than in the Min-Fuel condition.The speed profile for the Fuel-and-Time condition saved 45 seconds compared to that for the Min-Fuel condition (see Table 2), at the cost of 23 lb of fuel.Fig. 9(b) shows the required thrust T as a function of x.A large value of thrust was required to accelerate the aircraft around x = -34 nmi due to the increase of the minimum-cost speed.
ConclusionsThe key contribution of this paper is an exact feedback-control formula for the speed strategy that accrue minimum cost during a descent under altitude restrictions.The sensitivity of the optimal speed strategy to winds and airlines' business objectives was analyzed by applying the formula to an actual arrival route.This analytical formula has the following potential applications:Evaluation of arrival procedures: While most altitude restrictions are set by terrain, noise, and separation of traffic flows, speed restrictions can be compared to the minimum-cost speed profile to see whether the procedure can be refined to reduce aircrafts' direct operational costs.Since weather, airlines' business objectives, and aircraft types all affect the minimum-cost speed profile, a static arrival procedure should at best achieve systemic fuel/cost savings on an aggregated basis.Scheduling efficiency of ground automation tools: Ground automation tools that assist ATC in scheduling arrival aircraft can take advantage of the minimum-cost speed profile and use this information to improve its scheduling efficiency.Specifically, the TSS system in the United States can use this information to improve the nominal speed profiles used as reference points for scheduling aircraft.Guidance of small jets: While large commercial jets equipped with performance-based Flight Management Systems (FMS) have similar capabilities of computing company-preferred speed profile based on the airlines' business objective, aircraft performance model, and limited wind information, small jets such as regional and business jets are equipped with simpler FMS that cannot compute minimum-cost speed profiles.These jets accounts for 25% to 30% of the operations in the United States [32].The methodology developed in this paper can be used to aid the airlines in the selection of speed profiles for these jets.The selection can presumably be made during the flight-planning phase.A reference point for multi-aircraft operations: During periods of medium to heavy traffic, separation constraints must be taken into account and minimum-cost speed profiles may not be always feasible for individual aircraft.Nonetheless, the minimum-cost speed profiles can still be used as a reference point for evaluating the level of optimality of the system and for computing systemic cost-effective strategies.Among the directions for future research, the following seem reasonable: * Compare the minimum-cost speed profile to actual trajectories and determine how far-off is the current-day operations from optimality.* Predict a systemic minimum-cost speed profile for a group of aircraft and a period of future time, using airlines' flight schedules and weather forecast.( e )eSuppose a and b are on the curve [I = 0], and let ab denote the segment of [I = 0] connecting these two states.If a segment a b of [I = 0] is contained in ab and is not an attainable state trajectory (i.e., state b cannot be reached from a using admissible controls), then the optimal state trajectory from a to b consists of three segments: the segment of [I = 0] from a to a state a 1 on aa , one (attained by a suitable extreme value of control) from a 1 to a state b 1 on b b, and the segment of [I = 0] from b 1 to b.

Appendix A Direct Operating Cost as a Path IntegralThe direct operating cost in Eq. ( 11) can be written as a path integral along the state trajectory [22].First, rewrite the equations of motion in Eqs.(8) in a matrix form:Invert the two-by-two matrix on the right hand side to write the control T as a linear combination of ẋ and V [22],Substituting Eq. (A2) into Eq.( 11),Multiplying the last term by a factor of unity, ẋ/(V + w),and changing the variables of integration,Here Γ stands for the trajectory, and dx and dV are related by the equations of motion and the control T .Eq. (A3) expresses the cost function as a line integral of a differential form P (x, V )dx + M (x, V )dV , where
Appendix B Optimal Control Strategy Connecting A State to the [I = 0] CurveThe following lemma proves that the optimal control strategy for the problem considered in this work must use either T min or T max when connecting a state to the [I = 0] curve.Lemma 2 A state trajectory that has no part in I > 0, has the final state on [I = 0], and passes through a state (x(t), V (t)) in I < 0 at some instant t * , with the control strategy T (t) strictly greater than T min in some neighborhood of t * , is not optimal.Proof.Construct a new control strategy, denoted here by T * (t), as follows.Replace T (t) by T min on the interval [t * , t 1 ], where t 1 is the earliest instant at which the newly obtained state trajectory, (x * (t), V * (t)), intersects either (x(t), V (t)) (Case (a)) or the curve [I = 0] (Case (b)), whichever happens first (if the two cases coincide, the situation is treated as as Case (a)).In Case (a), let T * (t) = T (t) for t ≥ t 1 , to obtainIn Case (b), let T * (t) = T mc (t) from t = t 1 until such earliest instant t 2 when (x * (t), V * (t)) intersects the (x(t), V (t)) (possibly at the final state).Assume this portion of arc on [I = 0] is attainable.From t = t 2 on, let T * (t) = T (t).This yieldsIn both cases, V * (x) by construction satisfies both of the following conditions: V * (x) ≤ V (x) for every x, and V * (x) < V (x) in some right-sided neighborhood of x(t * ).By Lemma 1a at Section 4.2, (x * (t), V * (t)) outperforms (x(t), V (t)).This completes the proof.Immediate consequences of Lemma 2, and of results analogous to it, are as follows:(i) An optimal trajectory passing through a state (x, V ) in I < 0 and later reaching [I = 0] has in state (x, V ) control T min .(ii) An optimal trajectory passing through a state (x, V ) in I > 0 and later reaching [I = 0] has in state (x, V ) control T max .

ABSTRACTAn analytical formula for solving the speed profile that accrues minimum cost during an aircraft descent with a constrained altitude profile is derived.The optimal speed profile first reaches a certain speed, called the minimum-cost speed, as quickly as possible using an appropriate extreme value of thrust.The speed profile then stays on the minimum-cost speed as long as possible, before switching to an extreme value of thrust for the rest of the descent.The formula is applied to an actual arrival route and its sensitivity to winds and airlines' business objectives is analyzed.
