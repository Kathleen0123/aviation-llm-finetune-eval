IntroductionA LTHOUGH airborne capabilities such as area navigation and required navigation performance, together with optimized guidance and control through the flight management system (FMS), offer substantial improvements to the efficiency of flight operations, their benefits frequently go unrealized in today's arrival airspace domain.To the frustration of the airspace user, efficiency gained en route using state-of-the-art airborne automation is often squandered during the final stages of flight as the airplane transitions for landing.Here, air-traffic control (ATC) actions often require the airplane to execute suboptimal tactical maneuvers that involve frequent temporary-altitude assignments, speed adjustments, and lateral vectoring to accommodate tightly coupled separation and trafficflow-management constraints.These actions, though designed to manage controller workload and ensure safety in heavy traffic conditions, prevent aircraft from executing an uninterrupted continuous descent approach (CDA) to the runway using low engine power for maximum fuel efficiency and minimum environmental impact.As a result, FMS guidance trajectories, which are optimized over time horizons that transcend ATC boundaries, are seldom executed to completion in today's arrival airspace.Accommodating efficient trajectory-based arrival operations under all traffic conditions is a key objective of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) [1].The benefit and feasibility of CDA operations has been a subject of considerable study [2,3].These studies have occasionally involved flight trials, some evolving into limited daily use operations into select airports around the world.Examples include the recent advanced arrivals trials in The Netherlands [4], CDA trials at Louisville [5,6], flight trials in the United Kingdom [7], the 4-D trajectory trials in Sweden, and the initial tailored arrivals trials conducted in Australia [8].Although these studies have involved a myriad of techniques for enabling CDA benefits, their focus has largely been on developing static arrival procedures for near-term deployment.As a result, the application of these CDA initiatives requires periods of low traffic density and/or specialized protocols that potentially limit throughput.A key feature of the flight trials described in this paper, which distinguishes them from related activities in the United States and abroad, is the inclusion of ground-based automation capable of generating dynamic CDA trajectory solutions in the presence of complex airspace constraints.The ability to tailor arrival solutions to accommodate individual aircraft performance, atmospheric conditions, and operational restrictions is critical for enabling CDAs in congested-airspace environments in which potential benefits are greatest.Toward this objective, NASA's En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) was incorporated into the trials to compute advisories for meeting arrival-time constraints artificially imposed at the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) boundary, designed to emulate operations under heavy traffic conditions.EDA is a research component of the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) that works in conjunction with the CTAS Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) to provide controllers with combinations of speed, altitude, and path-stretching advisories that satisfy time-based metering constraints while avoiding separation conflicts [9][10][11].To properly plan and execute a CDA solution, it is important that supporting automation accurately predicts the arrival trajectory.Inaccurate ground-based trajectory predictions will result in poor capacity utilization and increased probability of having to interrupt the descent in response to unanticipated conflicts, thereby quickly erasing CDA benefits.Inaccurate airborne predictions can result in poor overall energy management in the descent, thereby compromising CDA efficiency benefits by increasing the odds that energy will need to be added or subtracted through undesirable throttle or drag-deployment actions.Idle-thrust descents are particularly vulnerable to prediction inaccuracies, due to unavailability of engine throttle as a mechanism for removing excess energy should the need arise.For these reasons, the accuracy and compatibility of ground-based and airborne predictions (facilitated by the exchange of atmospheric state and profile intent data) were a key focus of the flight trials described in this paper.These trials relied upon datalink services and avionics equipage currently available only in oceanic airspace for U.S. air-traffic operations.For this reason, near-term (2008-2012) applications of tailored arrivals will likely be limited to transoceanic operations.The concepts and procedures developed during these trials, however, are extensible to both oceanic and domestic arrival operations under NextGen in 2012 and beyond.The automation systems, clearance composition, and human procedures used in carrying out the EDA-supported flight trials are first described, followed by results illustrating potential fuel and emissions benefits.Given the importance of accurate underlying trajectory predictions in planning and executing tailored arrivals, results are then presented that compare EDA and FMS prediction performance against truth data.
II. ApproachIn collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and United Airlines, the oceanic tailored arrivals (OTA) trials were conducted over 40 days with a single United Airlines Boeing 777 flight (UAL76) in commercial service between Honolulu and San Francisco (SFO).The flight was operated along the Central-East-Pacific (CEP) oceanic route structure, composed of a series of fixed parallel tracks from the Hawaiian islands to the California coast [12].In addition to its avionics equipage, UAL76 was chosen largely because of its early morning (0530 hrs local) arrival time at SFO, which avoided congested-airspace conditions, thereby minimizing the likelihood of interference with other traffic.
A. System ComponentsFigure 1 illustrates the key systems employed in formulating, communicating, and executing the trajectory-based arrival clearances used to support the OTA field trials (the precise content of the data communications between the various system elements is described later in the paper).Clearance delivery was initiated approximately 700 n mile from landing in oceanic airspace controlled by the Oakland Air-Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), referred to as ZOA.In oceanic airspace, controllers at ZOA rely upon the FAA's recently deployed Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) system for integrated communication, navigation, and surveillance functions.A prominent capability of ATOP is its ability to support two-way digital messaging between ATC and the flight deck through controller-pilot datalink communications (CPDLC).The OTA route clearance (composed of lateral waypoints together with speed and altitude restrictions) was relayed to the flight deck using a standard CPDLC message format supported by ATOP.The format allowed the OTA instructions, upon pilot approval, to be directly loaded into the B777 FMS through its Future Aircraft Navigation System (FANS) avionics interface.FANS avionics integrate FMS functionality with CPDLC and contractbased automatic dependent surveillance (ADS-C) services in oceanic airspace.Once loaded, the OTA route clearance provided sufficient information for the FANS FMS to compute a 4-D reference trajectory from the aircraft's current position to the runway.This trajectory was then used by the FMS as the basis for its lateral navigation (LNAV) and vertical navigation (VNAV) guidance functions, which provided inputs to the automatic flight control system for determining appropriate aileron, rudder, elevator, and throttle inputs.Once activated, the OTA route clearance allowed the flight to progress with no additional pilot inputs required before configuring the airplane for landing.The nominal guidance law used by the FMS VNAV function was set to path mode, which directed the autopilot to null any positional error between the airplane's current altitude and the FMS reference trajectory's vertical profile.In the event that the airspeed required to control path differed from that suggested by the reference trajectory by more than 10 kt, the VNAV guidance laws would switch from path control mode to speed control mode.To provide a dynamic element to the OTA trajectory-based clearance, a prototype version of NASA's EDA decision-support tool was incorporated into the field trials.EDA was used to compute the maneuver solution needed to target a meter-fix crossing time constraint imposed at the TRACON boundary.Originally designed to assist the domestic en route sector controller in developing conflict-free arrival metering solutions under capacity-constrained conditions, EDA was adapted to ZOA airspace and interfaced with ATOP to receive oceanic surveillance and flight-plan data.These oceanic surveillance data were derived from the airplane's satellitebased positioning system and relayed to ATOP via ADS-C at the maximum available rate of once every 2 min, as specified in the ADS-C contract configured by ZOA.In addition to surveillance and flightplan inputs, EDA required atmospheric data to compute the longrange trajectory predictions needed for its advisories.These input data were derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) rapid update cycle (RUC) model, which provided 2 h forecasts (updated each hour) of wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and pressure, organized in a Lambertconformal 3-D grid with a lateral resolution of 40 km.For the purpose of the OTA trials, EDA computed only descent calibrated airspeed (CAS) advisories for targeting a scheduled time of arrival (STA) at the TRACON meter fix (waypoint BRINY).EDA cruise-speed and path-stretch advisory capabilities, along with automated conflict resolution functions, were purposely suppressed to avoid complexity in these initial trials.For optimal TRACON throughput under congested conditions, EDA derives its target STAs from TMA.During the time of these trials, however, no capacity constraints existed, and so meter-fix STAs were artificially set to within 4 min of the airplane's original estimated time of arrival (ETA) at BRINY.This original ETA was computed from an EDA trajectory prediction using a nominal assumption of company-preferred descent speed (280 kt) [11].An example of EDA's graphical user interface, showing a descent-CAS advisory for UAL76 of 267 kt, is illustrated in Fig. 2. Advisory information is presented in both the aircraft's flight data block as well as in a separate advisory window that allows controllers to accept or reject EDA Fig. 1 OTA system components (AOC denotes airline operations control).recommendations.In the example shown in Fig. 2, the descent-speed advisory was generated to absorb 2 min of required delay, evident in the ETA and STA timelines shown to the left of the display.
B. Profile Development and Clearance CompositionA primary challenge for OTA, as with any CDA activity, is the design of the profile constraints that define the VNAV descent profile.These constraints must be carefully chosen to allow the FMS to build a trajectory that can be flown with near-idle thrust, using only elevator inputs and normal drag-device deployment (i.e., flaps and landing gear) for vertical control.This design problem involves energy management in the presence of multiple constraints.The descent trajectory must allow the potential and kinetic energy at top-of-descent (TOD) to be bled off at a sufficient rate to satisfy all ATC and aircraft operational constraints along the descent path, while leaving the aircraft in a suitable energy state and control configuration at the final approach fix.To further constrain the problem to allow the FMS to generate a unique idle-thrust trajectory solution for a given wind forecast, an initial descent-speed profile must be chosen.In the absence of time-based metering requirements, this speed profile is set by the FMS based on a cost index, computed as a ratio of time and fuel related costs for an economical idle-thrust (i.e., ECON) descent [13].For OTA flights in which meter-fix crossing times were imposed, EDA was used to override the cost index in determining the appropriate initial descent-speed profile.This use of EDA and its subsequent impact on TOD, flight-path angle and meter-fix arrival time is described in detail in [9].The OTA route clearance consisted of the entire set of lateral and vertical constraints needed by the FMS for building an idle-thrust guidance trajectory.The OTA route clearance was developed iteratively, relying on extensive flight simulation with United Airlines (UAL) and The Boeing Company line pilots under various wind conditions and descent-speed assumptions.The primary objective was to avoid leaving the airplane low on energy relative to the VNAV path, which would trigger undesired throttle inputs from the autopilot.The second objective was to avoid leaving the airplane high on energy relative to the VNAV path, which would require speed brakes, unusual flap settings, and/or steep-descent segments: all of which can increase pilot workload and passenger discomfort, while compromising desired fuel, emissions, and noise benefits.The OTA route clearance used to support flight scenarios with EDA, including lateral waypoint assignments and associated speed/ altitude crossing constraints, is shown in Fig. 3.The first restriction in the descent occurred at the EDA meter fix BRINY, in which the airplane was required to cross at 240 kt CAS, at an altitude of 11,000 ft.The next restriction occurred at Woodside (designated OSI), in which the airplane was required to cross at 210 kt CAS, at an altitude at or above 7000 ft.The third restriction occurred at MENLO, approximately 12 n mile from SFO, in which the airplane was given no explicit speed restriction but required to cross at an altitude of 4500 ft or higher.Beyond MENLO, the remaining descent trajectory waypoints (CEPIN and AXMUL), crossing restrictions, and runway assignment (28R for these trials) were conveyed by the published approach procedure.Because the details of the approach procedure were already stored in the FMS, only the name "ILS 28R" needed to be sent via datalink along with the OTA route clearance.Upon receipt, the FMS automatically appended the detailed approach procedure to the OTA route clearance, thereby forming the basis of a complete guidance trajectory from oceaniccruise flight to the runway.
C. ProceduresAs illustrated in Fig. 4, OTA procedures were initiated in ZOAcontrolled oceanic airspace, inside oceanic control sector 4 (OC-4).A key challenge of these flight trials was to design procedures sufficient to allow UAL76 to progress uninterrupted along the intended OTA trajectory while traversing through different regions of airspace control.The challenge of executing the OTA trajectory was to develop procedural techniques for allowing UAL76 to progress uninterrupted from oceanic airspace (OC-4), through domestic en route airspace (ZOA sector 35), into the northern California TRACON (NCT) airspace, and finally to landing at SFO.No specialized training was required for controllers to participate in these trials.Instead, simple instructional bulletins were developed by ZOA managers and distributed and briefed to controllers by area supervisors before operations on each day.Furthermore, these trials were conducted without any changes to sector boundaries, ATC standard operating procedures, or letters of agreement between adjoining facilities.OTA procedures were initiated from the flight deck voluntarily.Flight crews were informed of the OTA trials and expected procedures through a special flight-manual bulletin distributed through UAL crew stations.Once underway, OTA procedures could be terminated at any time at the discretion of either the flight crew or ATC.The flight would then be handled by ATC using normal arrival procedures, requiring the crew to typically disengage FMS LNAV/ VNAV functions.For simplicity, it was decided that once interrupted, no attempt would be made to resume a CDA via OTA uplinks or procedures.At step 1 in Fig. 4, the flight crew requested participation around 90 min before their estimated landing time, approximately 700 n mile from SFO and 450 n mile before entering radar-controlled domestic airspace.This request was made using a free-text CPDLC datalink message that read, "Requesting OTA trials."Upon receiving the crew request, the OC-4 controller configured a new ADS-C contract within ATOP that instructed the aircraft to downlink position, weather, aircraft state, and flight-path intent data at a 2 min rate, represented by step 2 in Fig. 4.Following ADS configuration, the primary OTA clearance, as previously described, was uplinked to the aircraft using a FANSloadable CPDLC message (step 3).The message, conveyed using CPDLC uplink message 83, was as follows: "At COSTS cleared CREAN CINNY BRINY/N0240A110 OSI/N210A070 MENLO/ A045A ILS28R."The test engineer coordinated with the ZOAoceanic supervisor in advance to affirm the assumed landing runway.Before accepting the clearance, the flight crew first ensured that it could be loaded satisfactorily into the FMS to produce a continuous trajectory to the runway (step 4).This FMS trajectory was computed in compliance with the route, speed, and altitude constraints stipulated in the OTA clearance.Upon crew acceptance of the OTA clearance, a "Wilco" message was downlinked to ATOP.Step 5 involved the uplink of wind and temperature data to the flight deck for inclusion in FMS trajectory calculations.These atmospheric data were derived from the same RUC 2 h forecast model used for ground-based EDA trajectory calculations.In addition to the forecast surface temperature at SFO, the data consisted of wind speed/direction at five points along the OTA trajectory corresponding to 1) cruise altitude at the waypoint CINNY, 2) cruise altitude at TOD, 3) 18,000 ft along the descent path, 4) 10,000 ft along the descent path, and 5) threshold crossing at SFO.These data were uplinked to the flight deck to provide FMS trajectory computations with the same atmospheric data available to EDA.This was essential to make valid trajectory-prediction comparisons between ground-based and airborne automation in posttrial analysis.Step 6 involved the uplink of the EDA descent-speed advisory, intended to control arrival time at the waypoint BRINY.The advisory was obtained from a prototype EDA tool running on a laptop computer in the ZOA oceanic control room.Upon extracting the advisory, the test engineer relayed it to the oceanic sector controller managing UAL76.The controller then used ATOP to relay the instruction to the aircraft in a datalink message consisting of the current Mach number and the advised descent CAS.Upon receipt by the flight deck, the descent-speed instructions were manually entered into the FMS VNAV descent page, which resulted in a recalculation of the FMS TOD and trajectory needed to target the BRINY constraint.Once reaching TOD, the FMS commanded the airplane to initiate the descent at an airspeed equal to the current Mach number until capturing the EDA-advised descent CAS.After leaving oceanic airspace and entering the radar-controlled domestic airspace of ZOA sector 35, UAL76 received a voice-based pilot-discretionary descent clearance to 8000 ft (step 7); all clearances were given by voice from this point forward because CPDLC services are not currently available in U.S. domestic airspace.Although coordination had already taken place between ZOA and NCT at the supervisory level, the ZOA sector 35 controller then notified the downstream receiving controller at NCT that UAL76 was "on the OTA."Assuming allowable traffic conditions, the NCT controller, upon accepting the hand-off from sector 35, cleared UAL76 to 4000 ft and issued the appropriate approach clearance and runway assignment (step 8).In general, procedures were designed so that all voice-issued altitude clearances stayed ahead of the altitude restrictions contained in the OTA route clearance being executed through the FMS to avoid interrupting the CDA.
D. Test Conditions and Data CollectionThe OTA trials were conducted in two phases: phase 1 (17 August-6 September 2006), and phase 2 (13 December-9 January 2007).The divided schedule was due to the airline's choice of when to assign a FANS-equipped B777 to UAL76.Two distinct operational test conditions were employed in the OTA trials, referred to as OTA1 and OTA2.For OTA1 flights, the initial descent speed was not stipulated by ATC; instead, the pilot was free to execute a pilot-discretionary descent using the FMS ECON speed profile computed using the cost index.OTA1 flights were conducted to help identify near-term procedural requirements and assess the immediate benefit of conducting tailored arrivals under light traffic conditions in which EDA automation is not required.OTA2 flights, which included the BRINY metering constraint for interoperability with EDA, were used to support trajectory-prediction comparisons between air and ground automation and congested-airspace benefit assessments.A summary of the OTA flights is shown in Table 1 with a breakdown of successfully completed events.There were 40 flight opportunities over both phases of the trials.Of these, pilots volunteered to participate on 35 occasions.RUC-based winds were successfully uplinked on 27 of these occasions.The total number of uninterrupted CDA operations to the TRACON boundary and runway (independent of successful wind uplinks) were 27 and 20, respectively, of which approximately 80% were OTA2 flights.Upon taking only those flights that had successful wind uplinks together with uninterrupted CDA to the TRACON boundary, and further eliminating those with any unexplained route deviations and/or pilotreported anomalies, 11 flights remained for the detailed trajectory analysis described later in this paper.The quantitative data collected during the OTA trials are shown in Table 2.In addition to quantitative measurements, qualitative data were collected to refine human procedures and identify real-world issues associated with OTA deployment and execution.Qualitative observations were also used to support postflight quantitative analysis by helping to explain any anomalies associated with a particular flight.Qualitative data gathered by project engineers included air-traffic control facility observations, jump-seat observations on the flight deck, and crew interviews at the gate upon arrival at SFO.
III. Results
A. Fuel and Emissions Benefits 1. Baseline ConditionsFor baseline fuel and emissions benefits, three flight-path scenarios were constructed to represent today's arrival operations under light, medium, and heavy traffic conditions.These baseline scenarios were derived from observing B777 arrival traffic into SFO off CEP routes, captured for various times of day from flight-track data gathered one week prior and during the OTA phase-1 and phase-2 trials.The lateral and vertical track data from which baseline scenarios were derived are shown in Fig. 5 for various times of day.Particularly for morning and evening flights, when traffic is heaviest, these data show the inefficient lateral vectoring and altitude level-off maneuvers resulting from air-traffic control actions taken to manage separation and throughput constraints.The three baseline trajectories derived from these data are shown in Fig. 6.The light-congestion baseline was used to estimate near-term benefits, because it represents traffic conditions for which OTA procedures could be invoked today without the deployment of EDA.To claim OTA benefits in comparison with the medium and heavy traffic baseline scenarios, it is assumed that EDA is available as a supporting groundside tool for developing conflict-free metering solutions.
Fuel BenefitsBecause of the unavailability of direct fuel-burn measurements from the aircraft, OTA fuel benefits were estimated Boeing's proprietary BCOP/INFLT database and performance analysis software.Fuel burn associated with each of the three baseline scenarios was estimated in BCOP/INFLT for a range of initial descent-CAS values: 260, 280, 300, and 320 kt.Comparative fuel-burn results were computed for modeled OTA1 and OTA2 trajectory profiles using the same range of initial descent-CAS values used for the baseline scenarios.For the OTA1 profile, the descent CAS was assumed to be constant up to the transition to the built-in FMS speed restriction of 240 kt, occurring whenever the aircraft crossed through 10,000 ft.For OTA2 flights, the descent CAS was held constant before transitioning to the BRINY crossing restriction of 11,000 ft and 240 kt.For each baseline and OTA scenario, Table 3 shows the distance flown and estimated fuel burn between CREAN (located on the oceanic control boundary approximately 240 n mile from landing) and SFO for a B777-200.Over all baseline and OTA scenarios, the effect of initial descent CAS on total fuel burn was small, amounting to less than a 25 lb fuel difference between the optimal descent CAS (280 kt) and the least efficient descent CAS (260 kt).Therefore, to simplify the presentation of results, Table 3 shows the fuel burn averaged across all descent-CAS variations.Under light-congestion traffic conditions, results indicate that OTA1 can provide average fuel savings of 242 lb per flight over current-day baseline operations for B777 flights arriving at SFO along CEP routes.These savings drop slightly to 227 lb for OTA2 as a result of the additional profile constraint introduced by the meter-fix crossing restriction at BRINY.Potential fuel savings under lightcongestion traffic conditions, however, are well represented by the OTA1 results, because EDA would not be required to enable CDA operations.Furthermore, because these savings are not dependent on EDA, they could be realized in the near-term using current oceanic automation systems together with trajectory-based procedures.For medium and heavy traffic-congestion scenarios, average estimated OTA fuel savings increase to 358 and 3219 lb per flight, respectively.The dramatic increase in estimated fuel savings for the heavy traffic comparison was due to the inefficiencies inherent in the baseline scenario for achieving flow management and separation assurance under congested conditions.As seen in Fig. 6, these inefficiencies included an extra 30 n mile path-stretch segment performed in level flight at low altitude (6000 ft).To accurately  estimate OTA fuel savings under heavy traffic conditions, the effect of upstream metering actions needed to approximately match the arrival times of baseline flights into SFO was considered.For these scenarios, delay absorption was required to prevent OTA flights from arriving too early, thereby violating capacity constraints.Although, ideally, some delay could be absorbed on the ground by carefully planning departure times in anticipation of CDA operations in the presence of other traffic, it is more realistic to assume that delay must be absorbed in flight, either as a result of additional EDA advisories in arrival airspace and/or regional applied further upstream.To compute the fuel savings associated with heavy-congestion operations, an approximately 25% fuel-burn penalty was calculated for OTA flights to account for upstream metering actions.It was assumed that this penalty was taken upstream of CREAN in cruise flight in the form of a path-stretching maneuver designed to match baseline arrival times.This penalty Fig. 6 OTA baseline scenarios derived from current-day observations.accounts for fuel savings in the heavy-congestion scenario of Table 3 being less than the difference in fuel burned from CREAN to SFO between baseline and OTA scenarios.No such penalty was needed for OTA flights under light and medium traffic congestion, because required delay absorption could be accomplished with the descent-CAS variation already taken into account.
Emissions BenefitsEstimates of per-flight OTA emissions reduction in comparison with baseline conditions are shown in Table 4.These results were calculated along with the fuel burn using BCOP/INFLT between CREAN and SFO.Table 4 shows the effect of OTA on the four compounds of primary concern to the environment.These are 1) carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a greenhouse gas produced as a normal product of organic-fuel combustion; 2) carbon monoxide (CO), a poisonous gas resulting from incomplete combustion; 3) nitrogen compounds, primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), resulting from high-temperature combustion and commonly associated with ozone and smog; and 4) all species of hydrocarbons (C x H x ), volatile organic compounds resulting from unburned or partially burned fuel passing through the engine [14].As shown in Table 4, results suggest that an idle-thrust, OTA1 descent to the runway can reduce CO 2 emissions by 761 lb per flight in comparison with B777 operations on similar routes conducted during light traffic congestion.In comparison with medium and heavy trafficcongestion baselines, OTA2 has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by as much as 1128 and 10,137 lb per flight, respectively.These large greenhouse-gas reductions reflect the approximate 3:1 ratio between fuel burned and CO2 emitted, resulting from the basic combustion chemistry of jet fuel [14].
B. Trajectory PerformanceData showing the accuracy of FMS arrival-time predictions to the meter fix (BRINY) in comparison with the actual BRINY crossing time, as a function of time-to-go to BRINY, are shown in Fig. 7.These data show the expected continual improvement of airborne predictions as the airplane progresses through oceanic and domestic airspace.Of note are the distinct improvements in prediction accuracy for several flights that can be observed to correspond to the wind and descent-speed uplink events.The latter, of course, was expected whenever the airplane's original VNAV descent speed, based on cost index, differed from the EDA descent-speed clearance that was uplinked and executed.EDA and FMS arrival-time estimates to the meter fix, resulting from trajectory predictions generated 200 n mile=25 min upstream at CREAN, are illustrated by the histogram in Fig. 8.These results pertain to a single prediction at CREAN (i.e., without updates as the flight progresses).These data show mean arrival-time prediction accuracies of 2 s early and 3 s late for FMS and EDA, respectively, with a similar dispersion about the mean ( 20 s) for both.These data suggest that airborne and ground-based automation can predict arrival times over a 25 min horizon with similar accuracy and precision, assuming shared wind and descent-speed-intent information.Because EDA conflict-avoidance functions require accuracy at each point along the trajectory prediction, not just at the meter fix itself, the entire EDA prediction was compared with surveillance truth data.The overall accuracy of EDA trajectory predictions for several look-ahead times is shown in Table 5.These results capture the error in altitude, along-track position, and cross-track position along the entire trajectory prediction to the meter fix for time horizons of 23, 20, and 17 min.These look-ahead times were chosen so that predictions for all flights could be initiated between the oceanic control boundary and TOD to allow use of ARTCC radar surveillance as truth data, captured every 12 s.Inherent latencies associated with the radar data (a constant bias for each flight ranging from 6 to 12 s) were identified and removed in postprocessing by calibrating them with the time-stamped airplane position reports received via ADS-C.Figures 9 and10 show the altitude and alongtrack error for all flights as a function of time for a 23 min horizon.A similar comparison of FMS trajectory-prediction error as a function of time was not possible, because only the FMS time estimates to downstream waypoints were available, not the full trajectory predictions upon which those estimates were based.Results in Table 5 show that EDA's mean altitude prediction error, ranging between 500 and 700 ft, does not vary substantially with time horizon.This is because most altitude error occurs in the descent phase of flight, which is fully contained within each prediction horizon and influenced primarily by speed intent and modeled aircraft performance characteristics, rather than initial conditions in cruise.The negative mean altitude error is due to EDA predicting the airplane to reach the meter-fix crossing altitude earlier than what actually occurred, due to EDA's modeling of the deceleration to the meter-fix crossing speed (240 kt) using a level-flight segment.Although this assumption works well for the current-day TMA operations that EDA was originally designed to support, it is a poor model for CDA operations specifically designed to avoid level-flight segments.The result is a ground-based prediction to the meter fix that lags the actual flight operation.This results in an earlier TOD estimate (evident by the initial spike in altitude error in Fig. 9) and lower overall altitude prediction in comparison with truth.The same phenomenon results in the negative mean along-track prediction errors (ranging between 0:6 and 1:3 n mile) seen in Table 5.Unlike altitude errors, along-track errors averaged over the entire trajectory prediction grow significantly as the time horizon increases from 17 to 23 min.This is due to groundspeed prediction error (resulting primarily from remaining wind uncertainty) occurring over both cruise and descent.This EDA-prediction analysis includes the effect of sharing wind data and descent-speed intent with the airplane in actual operations.To see the importance of shared descent-speed intent (in particular, on air/ground predictions), a simple study was carried out looking at EDA trajectories under descent-speed-intent assumptions ranging from 250 to 320 kt CAS.Over a 25 min prediction horizon, the altitude and along-track differences at any given time can be as large as 6500 ft and 20 n mile as a result of descent-speed-intent uncertainty.
C. Procedural FindingsSeveral key procedural lessons were learned from the flight trials that have important implications for routine CDA operations, as described next.
Interairspace CoordinationA key challenge was the design of procedures sufficient to allow UAL76 to progress uninterrupted along the intended OTA trajectory while traversing through different regions of airspace control.Indeed, this represents a general problem associated with accommodating trajectory-based operations (optimized over long time horizons) in today's highly segmented ATC system.Based on feedback from pilots and controllers, it was concluded that the procedures used in these trials for reiterating altitude assignments and crossing restrictions by voice as the airplane progressed from one region of airspace to another were less than ideal.Although these techniques allowed the flight trials to be conducted in conformance with airline and ATC standard operating procedures, they were   deemed too cumbersome for routine operations.More important, there was occasional confusion on the flight deck resulting from a perceived mismatch between restrictions conveyed by voice and those inherent in the previously uplinked OTA clearance.From a pilot perspective, the issuance of step-down altitude clearances via voice served primarily as a cue for dialing down the assigned altitude in the autopilot mode control panel (MCP).Because even with VNAV engaged the autopilot would force the airplane to level off upon reaching the MCP altitude, it was imperative that voice-issued altitude clearances be issued in a timely fashion to prevent interrupting the descent.In posttrail discussions with subject-matter experts, it was concluded that voice procedures could be improved by allowing controllers, upon receiving a hand-off from an upstream facility, to simply instruct the airplane to continue the descent via the uplinked clearance.Although a departure from standard procedures, this approach offers to streamline phraseology while preventing inconsistencies between voice and datalink instructions.
Wind Data TransferThe importance of accurate wind data to ground-based and airborne predictions was highlighted by the trajectory analysis described in the previous section.Based on these results, it is clear that CDA operations using the FMS for guidance and control require accurate and timely wind forecast data.Although the technique of relaying ATC-derived winds to the aircraft through the company dispatch center worked well for the purpose of the field trials, it was concluded that it would be easier to update winds directly from the company's own forecast data in routine operations.
Noise-Abatement ProceduresThe enforcement of the 7000-ft-alt minimum over OSI for noiseabatement purposes introduced a difficult constraint on the OTA vertical profile.The 7000-ft-alt minimum over OSI was higher than the ideal altitude over this point for executing an idle-thrust CDA in compliance with speed, altitude, and routing constraints closer to the runway.As a result, pilots often had to apply speed brakes between OSI and MENLO to remove excess energy to stay on the FMS VNAV path.With no altitude constraint on OSI, it was found in flight simulation that a B777 would cross OSI at approximately 5500 ft under normal wind conditions.Because noise-abatement procedures are typically imposed with the assumption that airplanes will be in level powered flight at the specified minimum altitudes, an argument can be made for relaxing these constraints to accommodate idlethrust CDA operations.It is anticipated that the noise reduction  associated with lower engine power will offset the increased noise exposure resulting from the lower altitude profile.Quantitative analysis of noise data gathered during the flight trials will be presented in a follow-up paper, along with recommendations for optimizing the vertical descent path to achieve better energy management without compromising noise abatement.
IV. ConclusionsThe San Francisco oceanic tailored arrivals field trials demonstrated the ability to conduct highly efficient continuous descent approach operations under real-world conditions with commercial airplanes.By integrating advanced air and ground automation over datalink in oceanic airspace, these trials provide a step toward understanding the feasibility and benefits of conducting trajectory-based arrival operations under NextGen.To progress toward enabling tailored arrivals under congested traffic conditions in which benefits are greatest, NASA's ground-based EDA automation was used to tailor trajectory solutions to accommodate timebased metering constraints.Data gathered during these trials were used to perform an assessment of EDA trajectory-prediction accuracy and precision in comparison with FMS predictions and surveillance truth data.Results show that trajectory-prediction errors can be greatly reduced through the uplink of wind and descent-speedintent data and that similar arrival-time prediction performance can be achieved between air and ground automation.These results are important because accurate and compatible prediction performance between air and ground automation is fundamental to both the planning and execution of trajectory-based arrival operations.An initial benefits assessment based on the real-world data gathered during these trials shows the potential for substantial perflight reductions in fuel burn and environmental emissions with tailored arrivals, especially in comparison with baseline arrival operations conducted under heavy traffic conditions.These results are particularly compelling in the presence of today's high fuel costs and increased environmental awareness.Although EDA and related scheduling automation are important technologies for achieving the benefits associated with uninterrupted CDA operations to the runway under tailored arrivals, further studies are required to determine what additional technologies, particularly in the TRACON domain, might be required to capture the full range of theoretical benefits in actual high-density traffic operations.Fig. 22Fig. 2 EDA plan-view graphical user interface showing descent-speed advisory.
