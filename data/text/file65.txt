IntroductionH ANDLING qualities are those characteristics of a flight vehicle that govern the ease and precision with which a pilot is able to perform a flying task [1].They are a manifestation of the interaction between various factors that influence pilot perception of how well a vehicle can be flown to accomplish a desired mission.These factors include the basic stability and control characteristics of the vehicle, the control systems that modify these characteristics, the inceptors (e.g., control stick or throttle lever) used by the pilot to transmit control commands, the visual cues from cockpit windows and displays/instrumentation that provide flight information to the pilot, and other cues (e.g., aural, tactile) that influence the pilot in the execution of the flying task.If a vehicle has good handling qualities, the pilot does not need to expend much effort compensating for vehicle deficiencies and can therefore reserve substantial cognitive capacity to successfully tackle anomalies or emergencies encountered in flight operations.The effects of the preceding factors on handling qualities have been studied in atmospheric flight vehicles over many decades [2][3][4][5][6].Standards for the handling qualities of both fixed-wing aircraft [7] and rotary-wing aircraft [8] have been developed and are now in common use.Broadly speaking, these standards define a subset of the dynamics and control design space that predicts good handling qualities for a given vehicle type and flying task.For example, the standards may specify a range of combinations of damping and natural frequency for a large aircraft during landing that corresponds to satisfactory, acceptable, and unacceptable handling qualities.They provide design engineers with guidelines to optimize the flight control system and minimize potential human-vehicle interaction issues.At this time no handling qualities standards exist for spacecraft.However, there exists a body of work on handling qualities of piloted spacecraft.Most of this literature dates back to NASA's Apollo program, covering studies conducted on lunar landing and orbital rendezvous/docking; there are also some publications on capsuleentry handling qualities and dynamics/control [9][10][11][12].A new generation of piloted spacecraft, such as the Orion crew vehicle [13], have been proposed to replace the space shuttle and ferry astronauts to lunar orbit.The ability of pilots to successfully carry out their missions will be determined in part by the handling qualities of these new spacecraft.Some flight operations may be fully automated whereas others may be executed with a human pilot engaged in various levels of supervisory control including manual flying tasks [14].Current NASA procedures require that human-rated spacecraft provide the capability for the crew to manually control the flight path and attitude with satisfactory handling qualities [15].These procedures require that, even for flight operations that are nominally executed in a highly automated control mode, the control architecture must provide the capability for a human pilot to switch to a manual control mode, whether due to failure of an automated system or of some component of the spacecraft.In these cases of emergency reversion to manual control, where the pilot role abruptly switches from monitoring to active control, it is important that the vehicle have acceptable handling qualities.Extensive experience from aircraft development and operations has shown that pilot-monitored automatic control systems are safer when they are designed to operate in a manner consistent with human piloting techniques.This allows for improved monitoring as well as graceful reversion to manual control in the event of failures in the automatic control system.It is therefore desirable for spacecraft designers to assess early in the design cycle what the handling qualities will likely be and to adjust their design if necessary to ensure that appropriate levels of handling qualities are available for both nominal and off-nominal operations.An effort to develop design guidelines for spacecraft handling qualities was initiated by NASA in 2007.A comprehensive set of guidelines should cover all classes of spacecraft and phases of flight; however, programmatic considerations made it necessary to focus initially on a few specific and relevant aspects.Lessons learned from aircraft and spacecraft handling qualities assessments over the past several decades were compiled [16].Piloted simulation studies of lunar landing [17][18][19] and Earth orbit docking [20][21][22] were conducted.This paper covers an initial study on handling qualities for capsule entry, evaluating manual control Presented as Paper 2010 at the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, Montreal, Canada, August 2-5, 2010;

II. Capsule Entry OperationsFor a spacecraft returning to Earth the atmospheric-entry phase of flight begins when it enters the atmosphere at approximately 400,000 ft (122 km) altitude and 17,000 mph (27; 359 km=h), following a deorbit burn.The subsequent trajectory of the spacecraft is governed by gravitational and aerodynamic forces; there are no significant propulsive forces affecting translational motion.The aerodynamic forces acting on the spacecraft can be varied by reorienting the vehicle in the atmosphere using control surfaces, reaction control system (RCS) jets, or both.This in turn modifies the trajectory enabling the autopilot or human pilot to steer the vehicle to the designated land/sea recovery site.Unlike winged spacecraft, such as the space shuttle, capsule spacecraft generally do not have aerodynamic control surfaces.Typically, the aerodynamic forces acting on a capsule are varied by using RCS jets to reorient the vehicle in the atmosphere.During hypersonic flight, winged spacecraft have a lift-to-drag ratio (L=D), on the order of 1; for capsule spacecraft the corresponding value is on the order of 0.3, so the capability for trajectory control is correspondingly less.Although capsules are generally axisymmetric in shape they can generate some blunt-body lift at non-zero angles of attack (Fig. 1), with (L=D) 0:3 attained at roughly 20 deg angle of attack during hypersonic flight.However, the capsule must be trimmed to hold that angle of attack.This is generally accomplished (as in Apollo capsules) by precisely positioning the capsule centerof-mass (c.m.) away from the axis of symmetry so that the line of total aerodynamic force (i.e., resultant of lift and drag forces at the centerof-pressure) passes through the c.m. as shown in Fig. 1.The flight control system provides rate damping in the pitch and yaw axes to compensate for small disturbances.From a practical point of view it is easier to offset the c.m. toward the equipment compartment rather than the crew compartment, and the resulting trim orientation of the capsule puts the crew compartment upside down (Fig. 1).From the crew's perspective, the spacecraft is moving backwards because the ablative heat shield, which is located behind the crew, must point forward for capsule entry.The mechanism for trajectory control during entry is to tilt the lift vector relative to the local vertical.This corresponds to a rotation of the vehicle about the air-relative velocity vector and is accomplished by applying a control moment about both the roll-and yaw-body axes.The rotation angle about the velocity vector is the bank angle (Fig. 1); it determines the component of lift that opposes the gravitational force along the local vertical, and hence, influences the acceleration along the local vertical given by:h L cos =m V 2 =R E h g (1)where m is the vehicle mass, V is the vehicle speed, R E is the radius of the Earth, h is the altitude above Earth, and g is the acceleration due to Earth gravity.The rate of change of vehicle speed ( _ V D=m) depends primarily on the drag force, a function of the airspeed and the local atmospheric density that decreases with altitude.The magnitude of the "eyeballs in" g-load experienced by the crew depends primarily on the drag force.Consider an entry trajectory with lift vector up ( 0).In this case the lift force opposes the gravitational force to the maximum extent possible, and the resulting altitude profile is such that the capsule spends more time in the higher altitudes where the atmosphere is less dense.This results in a lower average drag force, which in turn results in the longest down-range distance and the lowest g-loads.Conversely, an entry with lift vector down ( 180 deg) results in the shortest down-range distance and the highest g-loads.Bank-angle control allows adjustments to the down-range distance by varying the vertical component of the lift force, but any bank angle other than 0 or 180 deg will also result in a horizontal component of the lift force.Therefore, adjusting bank angle for down-range control has the side effect of providing a crossrange distance.This cross-range distance builds up over time and can be adjusted with periodic bank reversals as necessary.The resulting targeting accuracy can be impressive; for example, Apollo 10 splashed down within a couple of miles of its recovery ship.During normal entry operations, the desired bank angle is determined by the primary entry guidance system and then executed by the flight control system, which fires the appropriate RCS jets to properly orient the vehicle; the crew's function is to monitor the automated systems.The entry guidance system computes the desired bank angle (including bank reversals) using an algorithm that considers operational-performance factors such as range-to-target, gload profile, heating loads, and RCS propellant usage [11].If the primary entry-guidance system fails, then guidance may revert to a backup system.For example, a loads-managed guidance system can compensate for limited/degraded navigation data by using a simpler algorithm whose primary focus is on keeping the g-loads profile within human endurance limits.Although it adjusts bank angle to compensate for disturbances, it may not perform bank reversals (to keep the guidance algorithm simple), which results in substantial cross-range errors.As a final backup capability (for example, if the loads-managed guidance system also fails) the spacecraft can be placed in a ballistic mode by simply spinning the capsule about its axis of symmetry at a rate of 10-15 deg =s with no capability to control the resulting trajectory.This mode results in very high g-loads and an uncontrolled (ballistic) trajectory.For example, in recent years, two separate Soyuz spacecraft had to make ballistic entries as a result of system malfunctions, landing hundreds of miles short of their recovery site.Also, ballistic entry was the nominal flight mode for Mercury capsules.Although all three types of entry trajectories described above can be flown automatically by the flight control system that fires the appropriate RCS jets to provide the desired vehicle attitude, the capability generally exists for the pilot to manually fly these types of entry trajectories.
III. Experiment DesignThe principal objective of this experiment was to evaluate capsule handling qualities during atmospheric entry under manual control with different guidance options.The flight segment under study was from the entry interface (EI) point to the drogue parachutedeployment point.In this simulation the target splashdown site was located roughly 175 n miles (324 km) west of San Diego, California.The EI point was approximately 1,800 n miles (2,897 km) southwest of the recovery site at 400,000 ft (122 km) altitude; with an EI speed of 16,950 mph (27; 278 km=h), the time to drogue deployment was about 10 min for the simulated trajectory.Entry trajectories are influenced by many environmental and vehicle parameters such as atmospheric conditions (pressure, temperature, and winds), vehicle aerodynamics and mass properties, RCS jet properties, and navigation errors.The simulation featured two scenarios, characterized by nominal and highly dispersed values of many parameters including those mentioned in the preceding sentence.
A. Entry Performance MetricsUsage of the Cooper-Harper handling-qualities rating scale [1] involves an assessment of pilot compensation to achieve a desired or adequate level of pilot-vehicle performance.The key operationally relevant performance parameters for entry trajectories are g-loads, propellant consumed, and range-to-target at drogue deployment.In this experiment the g-loads constraint placed an upper limit on the time of exposure to sustained loads in excess of 3 g, defined by a linear log-log relationship between the points (3 g, 100 s) and (10 g, 10 s).There was an additional constraint on instantaneous g-load, with a limit of 8 g for desired performance (10 g for adequate performance).Based on the results of autopilot and human pilot test runs with different guidance configurations, the propellant usage limit was set to 90 lbm (40.8 kg) for desired performance [120 lbm (54.4 kg) for adequate performance].During autopilot runs the automatic flight control system executed bank-angle commands generated by the entry guidance system; the performance of these autopilot trajectories served as benchmarks for this study.Limits on final range-to-target depend on the piloting tasks discussed in the next section.
B. Piloting TasksThe simulation began in fast-time (i.e., non-real-time) mode with automatic control of the trajectory; it switched to real-time mode after about 3 min of simulation time (15 s clock time) when the g-load built up to a value of approximately 0.17.Shortly thereafter, when the g-load reached a value of 0.2, the pilot took manual control; at this point the capsule was 940 n miles (1,741 km) from the recovery site.The pilot continued flying the spacecraft until drogue deployment.The automatic control system provided rate damping in the pitch and yaw axes by firing the appropriate RCS jets.The pilot commanded a bank-angle rate using a rotational hand controller (RHC).The maximum bank-angle rate command was 20 deg =s at full displacement of the RHC, and at lower displacements it was proportionately less with some nonlinear shaping in the relationship between RHC displacement and commanded bank-angle rate.The pilot command was converted by a flight-control-system mixer into the appropriate roll-rate and yaw-rate commands.These body-rate commands were fed to the RCS jet-firing logic, which used one RCS jet to correct small bank-rate errors (<2 deg =s) and two RCS jets to correct larger bank-rate errors.The firing logic provided the commanded bank-angle rate within a deadband of 0:5 deg =s.By making small pulse-like RHC inputs, the pilot could adjust the bank angle to the desired value.There were two types of flying tasks: 1) bank-angle guidance tracking for loads-managed entry, and 2) flight parameter (vertical speed, Mach, and energy) schedule-following for targeted entry (there were two variants of this task).
Loads-Managed Entry TaskThe pilot tracked closed-loop bank-angle guidance commands generated by the loads-managed entry guidance system whose primary objective was to keep the g-loads profile within human endurance limits.The piloting task was to correct the error between the commanded and actual bank angles using an error needle on the cockpit display.The backup loads-managed guidance algorithm was designed for simplicity and robustness; it utilized lookup tables and required only bank angle and acceleration information.This algorithm computed the guidance command by searching a 5 deg bank-angle grid ranging from 0 to 360 deg; therefore, the commanded bank-angle signal was characterized by discrete jumps.The vehicle's actual bank angle had some drift due to aerodynamic moments.Hence, the error signal between the commanded and actual bank angle typically featured gradual variations separated by occasional jumps on the order of 5 deg.The error signal in the segments between these jumps is referred to as the steady-state error.For this piloting task, the relevant performance parameter for the handling-qualities assessment was steady-state error between commanded and actual bank angles.These error bounds were estimated from fast-time Monte Carlo simulations with a simple lagand-bias human-pilot model (not to be confused with the autopilot); this analysis showed that a bank-angle error limit of 6 deg provided gloads, final range-to-target, and propellant usage that were within operationally acceptable bounds from the benchmark autopilot values.Accordingly, the bank-angle tracking error limit was set at 6 deg for desired performance (10 deg for adequate performance).A key goal of the piloted simulation was to determine if the operationally relevant performance parameters (g-loads, final rangeto-target, and propellant usage) would have acceptable values if the manual piloting task was simply to keep the steady-state bank-angle errors within the specified limits.The performance goals for g-loads and propellant usage were as described in the preceding subsection.The benchmark autopilot runs resulted in final range-to-target values on the order of 60 n miles (111 km); hence, the performance goal was a range error less than 70 n miles (130 km).The reason for the large range error is that there were no bank reversals in this backup loads-managed guidance system's commands, which resulted in substantial cross-range error at drogue deployment.
Targeted Entry TaskThe objective of this exercise was to evaluate the feasibility, in the absence of any closed-loop guidance, of manually steering the capsule close to the target site while meeting the operational constraints of g-load profiles and propellant budgets.In the absence of bank-angle guidance commands for this task, the pilot used simple intuitive rules to determine the desired bank angle independently based on an open-loop guidance schedule of certain flight parameters specified at six range-to-target gates along the entry trajectory.These schedules were designed using a reference trajectory generated by the autopilot; the automatic flight control system followed commands from the primary entry guidance system in the nominal scenario.Relevant flight parameters [vertical speed, Mach number, and total (potential plus kinetic) energy] were extracted along the autopilot-generated trajectory at key gates (e.g., start of active manual control, bank reversals, drogue deployment).There were two types of schedule: a schedule of vertical speed only (called the h-dot schedule), and the full schedule of vertical speed, Mach, and energy.These schedules were presented on the cockpit display.The pilot monitored the evolution of the appropriate flight parameter(s) and adjusted the bank angle using intuitive rules of physics: raise the lift vector if sinking too fast and/or energy is decreasing too rapidly and lower the lift vector if sinking too slowly and/or energy is decreasing too slowly.Bank reversals were executed at four gates in the schedule to reduce cross-range error.A key requirement of this task is to get as close as possible to the recovery site target; hence, it is called the targeted entry task.For this task, the performance parameters for the handlingqualities assessment were g-loads, final range-to-target, and propellant usage.The adequate-performance limit for final rangeto-target was set equal to the performance goal of the loads-managed entry task [i.e., 70 n miles (130 km)], and the desired-performance limit was set to 50% of the adequate limit [i.e., 35 n miles (65 km)].The desired/adequate performance limits for g-loads and propellant usage were as described in the preceding subsection.
C. Experiment MatrixThe principal objective of this experiment was to evaluate capsule handling qualities during atmospheric entry for a loads-managed entry task of following closed-loop bank-angle guidance and a targeted entry task of following two types of open-loop schedule (h-dot and full).For each of these three tasks there were two scenarios corresponding to nominal and highly dispersed values of key parameters such as atmospheric conditions, capsule aerodynamics, c.m. location, RCS jet properties, and navigation errors.The resulting six configurations of the experiment matrix are depicted in Fig. 2.
D. Evaluation PilotsEight experienced test pilots served as evaluation pilots for this experiment; each had several thousand flight hours in a variety of fixedand rotary-wing aircraft.Two were NASA pilots with decades of aircraft flight test and simulation experience.Six were retired NASA pilot astronauts from the space shuttle program with a combined space flight experience of 11 missions as Pilot and 14 missions as Commander.All the astronauts had piloted atmospheric entry in a winged spacecraft (space shuttle) and one astronaut had also experienced atmospheric entry in a capsule spacecraft (Soyuz).Each pilot was available for about 8 h, and this time constraint was incorporated into the experiment design.
E. Training ProceduresUpon arrival, pilots received a detailed briefing on the experiment background and objectives, flying task, control system, experiment matrix, and data-collection procedures.Including discussion time with the experimenters, this session lasted approximately one hour.This was followed by a training and familiarization session (about 1.5 h) in the simulator cockpit where pilots practiced the flying task for various representative configurations drawn from the experiment matrix until they felt comfortable that most of the learning curve was behind them.
F. Data-Collection ProceduresEach pilot encountered the various experiment configurations in a different sequence.In order to avoid bias the pilots were not told whether the experiment scenario was nominal or dispersed.For each experiment configuration the pilot flew two formal evaluation runs with an option for a third run if necessary (e.g., if there were significant differences in performance across the first two runs).At the end of each run relevant performance data were displayed to the pilot and experimenters.In handling-qualities experiments pilots are typically asked to make a composite assessment of the overall performance across all formal evaluation runs for an experiment configuration.This assessment takes into account not just the quantitative evaluation of the performance at the end point (e.g., drogue deployment) but also a qualitative evaluation of the manner in which the vehicle gets to the end point.This overall assessment of desired, adequate, or inadequate performance is utilized for traversing the decision tree in the Cooper-Harper chart [1].Pilots use the Cooper-Harper scale to assign handling-qualities ratings from 1 (best) to 10 (worst) based on their assessment of task performance and required compensation.It is an ordinal scale, which means, for example, that the difference between ratings of 1 and 2 is not the same as the difference between ratings of 3 and 4. Ratings of 1, 2, and 3 on the Cooper-Harper scale correspond to Level 1 handling qualities, which are a general requirement for normal operations of flight vehicles.Desired performance is necessary, but not sufficient, for Level 1 ratings.Ratings of 4, 5, and 6 correspond to Level 2, which may be acceptable for some off-nominal conditions, and ratings of 7, 8, and 9 correspond to Level 3, which is acceptable only for transition to a safe mode after a major failure or disturbance.After making a composite assessment of the overall performance across the formal evaluation runs for an experiment configuration, pilots assigned a handling-qualities rating for that experiment configuration.The pilots also assigned ratings for each of the six components of the NASA Task Load Index [23].These six components were physical demand, mental demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration.Workload ratings on the Bedford scale [24] were also assigned by the pilots.As appropriate, pilots provided qualitative comments about the experiment configuration they had just evaluated.All pilot commentary was recorded on electronic media while the experimenters separately noted key comments and observations.After all experiment configurations had been evaluated there was a debrief session.The pilots filled out a one-page questionnaire designed to elicit high-level comments on cockpit displays, out-thewindow displays, guidance cues, control response, and experiment design.This was followed by a discussion with the experimenters on the pros and cons of the various experiment configurations.
IV. Simulation EnvironmentThe experiment was conducted on the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at the NASA Ames Research Center.The VMS is a largetravel motion simulator [25] that has been used for numerous handling-qualities evaluations [26].Six-degree-of-freedom simulator motion was utilized for the experiment.A single pilot seat was installed in the center of the simulator cab with a researcher/observer seat immediately aft of the pilot seat.A three-axis rotational hand controller (RHC) was installed on the right side of the pilot seat, and it was the only means of pilot input for this experiment.Although a three-axis translational hand controller was installed on the left side of the pilot seat, it was not used in this experiment, consistent with operating procedure for the entry piloting task.An illustration of the cockpit layout including the two hand controllers is shown in Fig. 3.A simulated view of the Earth and sky was projected on a set of three wide-angle collimated color displays with an image resolution of 1=2 pixel per arcmin.The window display had a large field of view: 48 deg vertical and 120 deg horizontal.Window masking was not used in the simulator cockpit and therefore the entire field of view was available to the pilot.This is not representative of actual operations where the pilots have only a limited field of view through small windows.However, the entry piloting task in this experiment was primarily a head-down task, and the pilot's attention was focused primarily on the cockpit instrumentation; the view outside the cockpit was used only for general situational awareness.
A. DisplaysThe cockpit console had three 6.5-in.(16.5 cm) color flat-panel displays.The center panel was the primary flight display (PFD) shown in Fig. 4. The upper half of this panel displayed an Attitude
B. Dynamics and Control ModelThe simulation used an early version of the Orion vehicle model developed by NASA and Lockheed-Martin using the Advanced NASA Technology Architecture for Exploration Studies (AN-TARES) software environment.The ANTARES simulation supports a wide variety of guidance, navigation, and control engineering analyses [27,28].The VMS staff developed a software process to integrate the ANTARES model with the local simulation environment.A description of the Orion entry performance and mission design can be found in [29], while [30] provides a description of the Orion entry simulation in ANTARES.The results reported in this paper do not constitute a formal evaluation of the actual Orion vehicle design; the goal of this study was to gain insight into entry-handling qualities of the capsule class of spacecraft using a preliminary Orion vehicle model as a means to that end.
V. ResultsThe data-collection period in the VMS was 8-19 June 2009.The eight evaluation pilots provided Cooper-Harper ratings, NASA Task Load Index (TLX) component ratings, Bedford workload ratings, and specific comments for each of the experiment configurations.They also provided their overall impressions of the manual entry tasks.For each run, time histories of numerous simulation variables were recorded along with key performance parameters at drogue  deployment.A total of 94 formal evaluation runs were made during this experiment.This section presents qualitative and quantitative results obtained from these runs.
A. Task PerformanceThe performance parameters of interest for this experiment were g-loads, range-to-target at drogue deployment, propellant usage, and bank-angle tracking error (for loads-managed entry task only).The experiment data showed that, for all formal evaluation runs, g-loads were within specified human endurance limits for both peak value and exposure time.Range error and propellant usage for all 94 formal evaluation runs, categorized by experiment configuration, are presented in Fig. 6; the data points outlined with a circle indicate autopilot data.A detailed explanation of these results is provided below.
Loads-Managed Entry TaskFor this task the only performance parameter for the handlingqualities assessment was steady-state bank-angle error between commanded and actual values, where desired and adequate performance bounds corresponded to error magnitude less than 6 and 10 deg respectively.These error bounds were established by fast-time Monte Carlo simulations with a simple lag-and-bias human pilot model; this analysis showed that a bank-angle error limit of 6 deg provided range-to-target, g-loads, and propellant usage that were within operationally acceptable bounds from the benchmark autopilot values.A key goal of the piloted simulation was to determine if the operationally relevant performance parameters (gloads, final range-to-target, and propellant usage) would yield acceptable values if the manual piloting task was simply to keep the steady-state bank-angle errors within 6 deg.To limit propellant usage pilots were advised not to correct errors under 2 deg.The experiment data showed that pilots were generally able to follow steady-state segments of the bank-angle guidance command with an accuracy of 5 deg or better.Range errors were always close to their corresponding benchmark autopilot values of 59.7 n miles (110.6 kg) for the nominal case and 57.6 n miles (106.7 km) for the dispersed case.The mean range errors for the piloted formal evaluation runs were 60.3 n miles (111.7 km) for the nominal case and 58.4 n miles (108.2 km) for the dispersed case, but the difference between the corresponding data sets was not statistically significant (P-value > 0:05).The individual range errors were all less than 70 n miles (129.6 km).A large range error (mainly cross-range) was expected for the loads-managed entry task because there were no bank reversals.Propellant-usage data showed a large spread relative to their corresponding benchmark autopilot values of 15 lbm (6.8 kg) for the nominal case and 31 lbm (14.1 kg) for the dispersed case.The mean propellant-usage values for the piloted formal evaluation runs were 41 lbm (18.6 kg) for the nominal case and 68 lbm (30.8 kg) for the dispersed case, and the propellant usage for piloted trajectories always exceeded the corresponding autopilot value.As expected, mean propellant usage for the dispersed case was substantially higher than that for the nominal case, and the difference between the corresponding data sets was statistically significant (P-value< 0:05).Propellant usage was less than 90 lbm (40.8 kg) for 90% of the data points and always less than 120 lbm (54.4 kg).The above results indicate that acceptable range errors are obtained for loads-managed entry if the manual piloting task is simply to keep the steady-state bank-angle error within 6 deg.For the overall data set of nominal and dispersed cases, the mean range errors were essentially the same as the benchmark autopilot values.However, the mean propellant usage was roughly 2.5 times the benchmark autopilot values.This suggests that additional RCS propellant may need to be budgeted for this manual piloting contingency, and that a looser guidance-tracking limit may result in a better trade-off between range error and propellant usage.Another possible explanation for the higher propellant usage is a highfrequency noise content in the guidance command which resulted in jittery movement of the error needle; this issue can be mitigated by filtering the guidance signal prior to display in the cockpit and/or by refining piloting technique for this task.
Targeted Entry TaskAlthough this task had a steep learning curve, the pilots were able to develop a flying technique during the training period to meet the performance metrics.For this task the performance parameters for the handling qualities assessment were range-to-target at drogue deployment, g-loads, and propellant usage.The experiment data showed that 94% of the data points had range errors within the desired performance bound of 35 n miles (64.8 km), and all were well within the adequate performance bound of 70 n miles (129.6 km).For the h-dot schedule the mean range errors were 23 n miles (42.6 km) for the nominal case and 16 n miles (29.6 km) for the dispersed case.For the full (h-dot, Mach, energy) schedule, the mean range errors were 16 n miles (29.6 km) for the nominal case and 14 n miles (25.9 km) for the dispersed case.Although the mean range error for the dispersed case was less than that for the nominal case for both types of schedules, the differences between the corresponding data sets were not statistically significant (P-value > 0:05).Additionally, for both nominal and dispersed cases, the differences between range error data sets for h-dot schedule and full schedule were not statistically significant (P-value > 0:05).This indicates that the open-loop guidance schedule, obtained from a primary-guidance-following autopilot run in the nominal scenario, is quite robust to large dispersions in key parameters such as atmospheric conditions, capsule aerodynamics, c.m. location, RCS jet properties, and navigation errors.Propellant usage was within the desired performance bound of 90 lbm (40.8 kg) for 77% of the data points, with only 2% of the data outside the adequate performance bound of 120 lbm (54.4 kg).For the h-dot schedule, the mean propellant usage was 52 lbm (23.6 kg) for the nominal case and 95 lbm (43.1 kg) for the dispersed case.For the full (h-dot, Mach, energy) schedule, the mean propellant usage was 51 lbm (23.1 kg) for the nominal case and 81 lbm (36.7 kg) for the dispersed case.As expected, for both types of schedules, mean propellant usage for the dispersed case was substantially higher than that for the nominal case, and the difference between the corresponding data sets was statistically significant (P-value < 0:05).For both nominal and dispersed cases the differences between propellant usage data sets for h-dot schedule and full schedule were not statistically significant (P-value > 0:05).The preceding results indicate that the complex entry trajectory can be piloted using simple intuitive rules to follow an open-loop guidance schedule, and this provides acceptable values of g-loads, final range-to-target, and propellant usage.Since the difference between the range-error data sets for nominal and dispersed cases was not statistically significant, it indicates that the open-loop guidance schedule is robust to large dispersions in key parameters that influence entry trajectories.Overall, compared to loadsmanaged entry performance, targeted entry achieved a 71% lower range error at the expense of 27% more propellant usage primarily due to the use of bank reversals.
B. Handling Qualities RatingsHandling qualities ratings for the six experiment configurations are presented in Fig. 7.In this bubble chart, the size of the bubble for a rating value indicates the number of pilots who assigned that rating, and a star symbol indicates the median rating.Each experiment configuration was rated by eight pilots except for the dispersed loadsmanaged entry configuration, which was rated by seven pilots.
Loads-Managed Entry TaskThe left portion of Fig. 7 shows data for nominal and dispersed cases for the loads-managed entry task.Most of the pilot ratings were Level 1, indicating satisfactory handling qualities.Pilot comments indicated that this was not a particularly challenging task.The primary, albeit not universal, complaint was about some highfrequency noise content in the guidance which resulted in jittery movement of the error needle; this issue can be mitigated by filtering the guidance signal prior to display in the cockpit.For the loads-managed entry task the only performance parameter for the handling-qualities assessment was steady-state bank-angle error between the commanded and actual values where desired and adequate performance bounds corresponded to error magnitudes less than 6 and 10 deg respectively.Desired performance was almost always achieved: the data typically showed an accuracy of 5 deg or better.The handling-qualities rating of 6 was assigned by a pilot who experienced mild oscillations while following the rather noisy guidance command too closely on one of his two formal evaluation runs for this configuration.This rating notwithstanding, the handling-qualities ratings for the nominal configuration were slightly better than for the dispersed case.
Targeted Entry TaskThe right portion of Fig. 7 shows data for nominal and dispersed cases for the two types of targeted entry tasks (h-dot schedule and full schedule).The pilot ratings were mostly Level 2, indicating that handling qualities warrant improvement.Pilot suggestions for improvement included retaining data at the previous gate on the schedule display (in addition to data on current states and target values at the next gate), and displaying data on the primary display for acceleration along the local vertical (h-double-dot).Pilot comments indicated a preference for the option to use energy and/or Mach information in addition to h-dot information, and this is reflected by a slightly higher fraction of Level 1 ratings for the full schedule.For the targeted entry tasks, the performance parameters were range-to-target at drogue deployment, g-loads, and propellant usage.The performance data presented in the preceding subsection indicated that pilots achieved desired performance most of the time.The Level 2 ratings can therefore be attributed primarily to the pilot compensation required for determining the bank angle to follow the specified open-loop guidance schedule.However, the noteworthy result for this task is not the Level 2 rating: it is the finding that such a complex piloting task can be accurately performed by using a simple open-loop guidance schedule that is robust to large dispersions in key parameters such as atmospheric conditions, capsule aerodynamics, c.m. location, RCS jet properties, and navigation errors.

Task Load Index Component RatingsNASA Task Load Index (TLX) component ratings for the six experiment configurations, averaged across all pilots, are presented in Fig. 8.Although TLX component ratings are typically combined into a single workload score, this analysis highlights the component ratings to provide some insight about the various aspects of pilot workload for the entry task.The data show that the primary TLX components for this flying task were mental demand, temporal demand, and effort, whereas the secondary components were physical demand, performance, and frustration.The loads-managed entry task had the lowest workload components, and for targeted entry tasks the full schedule had slightly lower workload components than the h-dot schedule; this was true for both nominal and dispersed cases.For each of the three piloting tasks, there were only minor differences between the nominal and dispersed cases.
VI. ConclusionsAn evaluation of handling qualities for atmospheric capsule entry was conducted by eight pilots, including six astronauts, flying the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator.The piloting tasks in this experiment were a bank-angle guidance-command tracking task for loads-managed entry, and two types of flight parameter (vertical speed, Mach, and energy) schedule following tasks for targeted entry.Each piloting task included two scenarios featuring nominal values and high dispersions for key parameters such as atmospheric conditions, capsule aerodynamics, center-of-mass location, reaction control system (RCS) jet properties, and navigation errors.Performance parameters of operational interest were range-to-target at drogue deployment, g-loads, and RCS propellant usage.In all cases, the g-loads were found to be within human endurance limits.For the loads-managed entry task, the pilot followed closed-loop bank-angle guidance commands generated by the backup loadsmanaged guidance system.The piloting task was to correct the error between the actual and commanded bank angles based on visual cues presented on the cockpit displays.Pilots were able to track steady-state segments of the guidance commands with an accuracy of 5 deg or better.With this level of tracking accuracy the mean rangeto-target values at drogue deployment were essentially the same as the benchmark autopilot values, whereas the mean propellant usage was roughly 2.5 times the benchmark autopilot values.These results indicate that additional RCS propellant may need to be budgeted for this manual-piloting contingency and that a looser guidance-tracking limit may result in a better trade-off between range error and propellant usage.Overall, the handling-qualities ratings for this task were Level 1. Pilot comments indicated that this was not a particularly challenging task.For the targeted entry task the pilot used simple intuitive rules to determine the desired bank angle based on an open-loop guidance schedule of certain flight parameters specified at several range-totarget gates along the entry trajectory.The flight parameters were vertical speed, Mach, and total energy.There were two types of schedule: a schedule for vertical speed only (h-dot schedule), and the full schedule of vertical speed, Mach, and energy.The piloting task was to determine bank-angle adjustments by using schedule data presented on the cockpit displays and applying intuitive rules, e.g., raise the lift vector if sinking too fast.Although there was a steep learning curve for this task, the pilots were able to develop a flying technique during the training period and get good scores on the performance metrics.Because this task included bank reversals, the range error was about 71% lower than that for the loads-managed entry task at the expense of about 27% higher propellant usage.Overall, the handling-qualities ratings for this task were Level 2. Since desired performance was achieved most of the time, the Level 2 ratings can be attributed primarily to the pilot compensation required for determining the bank angle to follow the specified open-loop guidance schedule.Pilot comments for improvement include displaying schedule information for the previous gate and displaying data for acceleration along the local vertical (h-double-dot).The ratings were slightly better for the full schedule and pilot comments indicated a preference for the option to use energy and/or Mach information in addition to h-dot information.The noteworthy result for the targeted entry task is not the Level 2 ratings: it is the finding that such a complex piloting task can be performed accurately using a simple open-loop guidance schedule that is robust to large dispersions.Fig. 11Fig. 1 Illustration of capsule entry dynamics.
