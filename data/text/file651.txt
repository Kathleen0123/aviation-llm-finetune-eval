Apparatus and Tests
TaskThe in-flight task was replicated as much as possible. 3Pilots started at 135 knots and 1.5 nmi from the runway and flew three visual approaches to full touchdown with each configuration.One approach was straight-in, and one each started with a 150-ft left or right lateral offset from the touchdown point.During the approach, pilots were instructed to maintain constant speed and remain on the glidepath (-2.5 degs) and localizer.Deviations were indicated on head-down instruments.At the start of the run, the aircraft was placed 1/2 dot off the desired localizer and glideslope.For the left and right offsets, pilots held that offset until an automated voice instructed the pilot to "correct."The pilot then maneuvered the aircraft to land on the desired touchdown point.The "correct" command occurred when the runway overrun disappeared from the visual field-of-view, which corresponded to an altitude of 100 ft.Figure 1 shows the desired touchdown point, which was the near-left comer of the 1000-ft fixed distance marker located to the right of centerline.This desired touchdown point matched the flight-test study.Table 1 gives the performance standards for the task.
Math modelLongitudinal configurations.A linear stability derivative model 4 generated the aerodynamic forces and moments on the aircraft.Bare airframe derivatives were combined from several sources. 3-5 ' 6 Response feedbacks of angle-of-attack and pitch rate to the elevator were used to simulate the different pitch configurations, given below, which mimics the NT-33 variable stability aircraft. 5Figure 2 shows the dynamic blocks of the pitch axis dynamics.The simulation centerstick dynamics were measured as:8 lon _ 0-125(22 2 ) --is) --«-----------«F , on s 2 +2(0.7)(22)s + 22_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 16 - 12 - 9 - - 6 - - 4 - - 16 0.38 16 2 - - 3 - -Commanded elevator deflection was the sum of the prefilter output and the feedbacks of angle-of-attack and pitch rate.The elevator actuator dynamics were modeled as a second-order filter with the NT-33 rate and position limits. 7In the linear range, the actuator dynamics are: 5 6c s+2(0.7)(75)s+ 75Four sets of aircraft dynamics were evaluated.The differences among the dynamics were effectively in the short-period mode.The pitch-to-elevator transfer function had the following form: The remaining parameter to be specified is the gearing between the elevator command from the stick and the longitudinal stick position.For the 18 tested configurations, which represent combinations of the aircraft dynamics and prefilters, the gearings are listed in Table 4.As an example, for configuration 2-B, the "2" corresponds to the values in Table 3 and the "B" corresponds to the values in Table 2.9 CSubsequent to the experiment's start, information from the Ref. 2 authors indicated that the Table 4 gearings may have been 70% higher than in the flight test.To evaluate the effect of different gearings on the results, a mini-experiment was run using the Ref. 2 gearings with configurations 3-1, 3-D, and 3-12.Differences between gearings were less than or equal to one handling qualities and pilot-induced oscillation point.Each of the 18 configurations was verified by performing frequency sweeps on each and overplotting the result against the analytical pitch-rate-to-stickdeflection transfer functions.The engine model consisted of a first-order transfer function from throttle input to thrust output.The time constant was nonlinear and depended on RPM. 7 Lateral.Using a lateral-directional stability derivative model, coefficients were adjusted to achieve the following modal and sensitivity characteristics: Atmosphere.Dryden turbulence with rms magnitudes of 3 ft/sec was used.A vertical 1-cosine gust occurred when the aircraft reached an altitude of 100 ft.The gust had a peak of 12 ft/sec and was time scaled based on the 6.7 ft chord of the NT-33.Safety pilot.Evaluation pilots in the NT-33 flight study were accompanied by a safety pilot, who ended the evaluation and assumed control of the aircraft if a potentially hazardous situation occurred.If a safety pilot assumes control, then questions arise immediately on that configuration's "controllability" from the handling qualities point of view.The presence of a safety pilot can also add a factor of stress, since another set of eyes is watching the evaluation pilot.In this simulation, an automatic safety pilot was implemented that assumed control of the simulated model when the nosewheel's vertical speed exceeded -8 ft/sec below a center-of-mass height of 12 feet.This criterion was developed empirically and was well received by the pilots.Upon activation, the pilot's controls went dead, a voice said "my airplane," and the math model initiated a go-around.
SimulatorMotion system.The NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) was used. 8It is the world's largest-displacement flight simulator, with capabilities shown in Figure 3.The cockpit was oriented for large longitudinal travel.The dynamics of the motion system were measured during the experiment using frequency response testing techniques. 9These dynamics were fit with an equivalent time delay in each axis.Software feedforward filters were used to tune the delays to achieve a close match among axes.The equivalent time delays for the surge, sway, pitch, roll, and yaw axes were all 80 msecs, and the heave axis had 110 msec of delay.By comparison, delays in the NT-33 model following control system have been suggested as being in the 45-60 msec range.Visual system.The visual scene was rendered with an Evans & Sutherland ESIG-3000 image generator.Three monitors comprised the field of view, as shown in Fig. 4. The visual system had a measured time delay of 80 msec from the pilot's stick position to the visual scene.Figure 5 shows the visual scene with the aircraft near the runway.The nose of the simulated aircraft is at the bottom of the field-of-view.Window mullions were added (oval in Figure 5) to replicate the cockpit.•>ped 0.0167(25 2 ) s z +2(0.7)(25)s+ 25Â head-up display was video mixed with the visual scene.The display included a pitch ladder, altitude above sea level, airspeed, rate-of-climb, heading, range, and a flightpath marker.The flightpath marker represented center-of-mass flightpath and used raw data only.
Motion configurationsThree motion configurations were examined: large, small, and no motion.The VMS motion platform software was modified to implement each.Large motion.The classical washout motion control laws of the VMS were used for this configuration.Second-order high-pass (washout) filters exist between the math model accelerations and the commanded motion system accelerations.These filters have the form:1 motion A,\ _ K mot 3 a mo delIn each of the six motion degrees-of-freedom, both K mot and <o mot were adjusted to keep the motion system within its displacement limits using motion system fidelity criteria suggested initially by Sinacori 10 and revised and validated subsequently. 11Table 5 shows the values used.The damping ratio, £ mot , was 0.7.In addition to these cues, roll/sway coordination and residual tilt crossfeeds were present in the motion logic.A coordinated-adaptive algoril used on many of today's hexapods, was employed in the small motion configuration. 13' 14 This algorithm assumed a mathematical model of a hexapod platform with 60-in stroke actuators.Thus, the stroke limiting that occurs when commanding several axes was present.Euler angles and translational positions of the platform were back solved on line from the resulting (and potentially limited) actuator positions. 15The Euler angles and positions were then used to drive the VMS platform.Second-order high-pass filters were used in the translational axes, while the rotational axes used a firstorder high-pass filter (unlike the Large motion configuration).The second-order filters had a damping ratio of 0.7, except for the surge axis, which was 0.8.For comparison, Table 6 gives the gains and natural frequencies (or pole locations) for the small motion filters.The gains listed are the maximum values, as the coordinated-adaptive algorithm reduces these values when the actuators near their travel limits.These gains were adjusted to use as much of the 60-in actuator stroke as possible.In the rotational axes, high motion fidelity is predicted for both pitch and yaw motion with the large and small motion configuration.Roll motion is low fidelity in both motion configurations, since the roll axis was attenuated to minimize the false lateral specific force cueing during coordinated rolling maneuvers.In the translational axes, all of the small motion cues are predicted to be low fidelity.For large motion, the fidelity improves, especially for the vertical axis, which provides a key cue for this task.This figure shows the benefit of large motion in fidelity terms.
PilotsFive experience test pilots, hereafter referred to as A-E, participated.Pilot A was an FAA test pilot, pilots B-D were NASA Ames test pilots, and pilot E was a Boeing test pilot.
Experimental procedureSummarizing the experimental variables, they were:1. motion configuration (3), 2. aircraft configuration (18)   Thus, each pilot evaluated 54 configurations.Pilots A, B, and E evaluated each configuration at least twice.Pilots C and D evaluated each configuration only once.The pilots each read the same experimental briefing.They had no knowledge of the configurations, which were randomized.After flying the task, the pilots were told of their performance.Then, they assigned a handling qualities rating using the Cooper-Harper scale, 16 a Pilot Confidence Factor, 16 and a Pilot Induced Oscillation Rating (PIOR). 6
Results and Discussion
Objective dataExample PIO. Figure 7 illustrates a classic divergent PIO that occurred with Pilot B, configuration 3-12, and large motion.The pilot was nearly on the longitudinal stick stops.The pilot gave this configuration a Cooper-Harper rating of 8, and a PIO rating of 5. PIOs of this severity and for this extended period of time did not occur for either the small or no motion configurations.The average frequency of the PIO in Figure 7 is 3.0 rad/sec (the average in-flight PIO frequency of this configuration was 2.2 rad/sec).Also shown on the pitch rate and normal acceleration traces are the motions that both the large and small motion configurations would produce for this visual motion.At the PIO frequency, the large motion configuration provides 100% of the pitch rate cue, and it leads the visual scene by only 5 degs of phase angle.So, the dashed line overlays the solid line.These values may be determined by inserting 3 rad/sec into the motion system filter discussed earlier with the pitch axis parameters (Table 5).The small motion configuration, at best, provides 50% of the visual pitch rate and leads the visual by 6 degs.By motion cueing fidelity standards, both the large and small motion cues are high fidelity. 1041or the normal acceleration, the large motion configuration provides 80% of the visual cue and leads the visual by 3 degs (this value includes the motion filter and the additional 30 msec of delay that the vertical platform lags the visual).But the small motion configuration provides only 13% of the visual cue and leads the visual by 20 degs.By motion cueing fidelity standards, the large motion cue would be high fidelity, and the small motion cue would be low fidelity.It is for this important acceleration cue that large motion provides a simulation benefit, and it is likely the reason for the superior performance of the large motion configuration as discussed later.Landing performance.Longitudinal touchdown position was analyzed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). 17While statistically significant differences occurred across the aircraft configurations (F(17,68)=3.73,p<0.001), differences among the motion configurations were not found (p>0.2).Lateral touchdown position was analyzed, and no significant differences were noted among the aircraft (p>0.4) or motion configurations (p>0.4).Approach airspeed errors were almost always within the desired performance standardDuring the evaluations, it was noticed that pilots had difficulty in judging sink rate during the flare-totouchdown as less platform motion was presented.Indications of this fact were either harder landings or the safety pilot assuming control for the small and no motion configurations.Figure 8 shows the means and standard deviations of vertical touchdown velocities for each motion configuration.Each mean is an average of 90 points (18 configurations x 5 pilots).The ANOVA on these data indicated that the motion configuration affected touchdown velocity independent of the vehicle configuration (F(2,8)=36.8,p<0.001). 17Aircraft configuration also affected touchdown velocity independent of motion configuration (F(17,68)=2.93,p<0.001).No interaction between the motion and vehicle configurations was present (p>0.3).Thus, touchdown velocity could be modeled as independent functions of the motion and aircraft configurations:h td = f (motion) + g(aircraft)As more motion was available, pilots were able to lower the touchdown velocity.A previous limited experiment with large motion also indicated this effect when the longitudinal handling qualities were poor; 18 however, the results here indicate that large motion allows lower touchdown velocities regardless of the configuration.As Table 1 notes, sink rate at touchdown was not a performance parameter in this experiment, which was also the case in the Ref. 3 flight experiment.However, the Ref. 2 simulation experiment added a touchdown performance criterion of < 4 ft/sec for desired performance and < 8 ft/sec for adequate performance.Had that been the case here, it is expected that even further differences among the motion configurations would have occurred.This is because when more platform motion was added, it compensated for sink rate perception deficiencies in the visual scene.

Motion ConfigurationFigure 8 -Touchdown velocities Safety pilot trips.Figure 9 shows the number of times the automated safety pilot assumed control versus the motion configuration.Over 1400 landings were performed, so the safety pilot assumed control in approximately 10% of the landings.It took control slightly fewer times with small motion than with no motion; however, large motion resulted in significantly fewer safety pilot trips.Many of the safety pilot trips occurred from the inability to judge sink rate.While it was stated earlier that causing the safety pilot to assume control should raise questions about the configuration's controllability, this seldom occurred.Pilots often felt they were still in control.The issue was that the small or no motion configurations did not assist pilots in their estimation of vertical velocity as did the large motion cues.Stick activity.Longitudinal stick rms positions were analyzed.Statistical differences occurred across aircraft configurations (F(17,68)=7.81,p<0.001), with configurations 5-10 and 3-12 having the most activity (0.96 and 0.93 in, respectively).Configurations 2-B and 3-D had the least activity (0.49 and 0.51 in, respectively).No significant differences occurred across the motion configurations (p>0.1).Small Motion.Figure 11 shows the in-flight versus simulation HQRs for small motion.Six of the 18 configurations lie within the 1-unit band, which is a degradation from the large motion condition.Again, the same trend on the best and worst configurations existed as for large motion.No Motion.Figure 12 shows the in-flight versus simulation HQRs for no motion.Five of the 18 configurations were within the 1-unit band, which is a degradation from large motion and small motion.Again, the same trend on the best and worst configurations existed as for large and small motion.Pilot Confidence Factors.Confidence factors of A, B, and C refer to a pilot's opinion that he can assign a handling qualities rating with a high, moderate, or minimum degree of confidence, respectively. 16Losses of confidence arise when simulation cues are incomplete or inadequate.Figure 13 shows that as more motion is provided, the pilot's confidence in assigning ratings improves.On average, both the no motion and small motion configurations caused the pilot to have less than a moderate degree of confidence in his rating.With large motion, that confidence improved to more than moderate.This difference was statistically significant across the motion configurations (F(2,8)=5.82,p=0.028).Differences in this measure were, not significant across the aircraft configurations (p>0.1).tcLL CD o C Q) c o O n=90

ConclusionsA piloted experiment examined the effect of three levels of platform motion displacement on the ability to predict pilot-induced oscillations.Objective and subjective measures were examined for large, small, and no platform motion.The small motion condition represented the displacement of a conventional hexapod platform.Overall, large motion matched flight more closely than either small or no motion.Specifically, large motion better matched the in-flight pilot-induced oscillation ratings and the handling qualities ratings than did small or no motion.In addition, with large motion, pilots assigned higher confidence factor ratings, achieved lower touchdown velocities, and caused fewer safety pilot trips as compared to the other motion configurations.Finally, only with large motion did markedly divergent pilot-induced oscillations occur.An example illustrated that high fidelity pitch rate cues were provided by both the large and small motion configurations.However, only large motion allowed high fidelity vertical acceleration cues to be presented.Pilots react strongly to vertical acceleration, and this likely contributed to the large motion configuration providing the best results.1.Figure 1 -Landing task
