Collection of airport arrival and departure data is described in Section 3, and delay metrics are formulated in Section 4. The numerical values of these metrics are also provided here in tabular form.Additionally, the aggregate trends are examined as a function of the days of the week.Section 4 describes modeling of departure, enroute and arrival delays using Normal and Poisson distributions.Finally, the conclusions are provided in Section 5.
Delay Statistics0][11][12] These reports contain delay statistics over the entire NAS along with some data specific to individual airports.They do not provide a comprehensive breakdown and analysis of the arrival, departure, and enroute delays for aircraft operations from major airports.This section will define the different regimes in which delays occur, give basic statistics on their magnitudes and frequencies, and offer some explanations as to why they arise.There is no industry-wide standard definition or measure of delay.Each organization involved in this area tailors the definition to suit the purpose at hand, however there are standard and precisely-defined events that can be used for this purpose: Out, Off, On, and In (OOOI) times.Out time refers to the time of pushback (specifically when the parking brake is released).Off time refers to the takeoff time at which weight is no longer borne on the landing gear.On time is associated with the touchdown time, and the In time is related to the moment the parking brake is applied at the gate.These times are recorded and reported by the respective airline, and their definitions will be used for delay and transit time computations in this paper.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) categorizes delays into gate delay, taxi-out delay, enroute (in flight) delay, terminal delay and taxi-in delay.Each category of delay arises when the aircraft requires more time in that regime than was scheduled.For example, terminal delays result when aircraft are held in holding patterns close to the airport prior to landing.Due to business reasons, air carriers interpret these delay definitions somewhat differently.For instance, some air carriers report arrival at the gate when the parking brake is applied, while others use the opening of the passenger door as the gate arrival event.Although the time difference between these events is small, it can nevertheless be the deciding factor in whether a flight is recorded as on time or delayed.Two government agencies keep air traffic delay statistics in the United States.The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) compiles delay data for the benefit of passengers.They define a delayed flight as one in which the aircraft fails to release its parking brake less than 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time.The FAA is more interested in delays indicating surface movement inefficiencies and will record a delay when an aircraft requires 15 minutes or longer over the standard taxi-out or taxi-in time (Out to Off time, or On to In time, respectively).In order to understand historical delay data, such as those maintained by the BTS and the FAA, it is useful to consider the phenomenon of scheduled delay.As congestion in the NAS increased in the 1990's, airlines recognized the value of minimizing the incidence of delays as recorded and reported to the public.The simplest way of reducing delays was not to increase the speed and efficiency of the system to meet the scheduled time, but to push back the scheduled time to absorb the system delays.As a result, one estimate put the number of scheduled delays that were built into airline schedules in 1999 at 22.5 million minutes. 13The number of arrival delays reported by BTS would have been nearly 25% higher in 1999 if airlines had maintained their 1988 schedules.An audit report by the Department of Transportation (DOT) states that the FAA reported an average departure delay time increase from 41.1 minutes in 1998 to 43.5 minutes in 1999. 13During the same period, the BTS reported a similar rise from 49.3 to 50.5 minutes.The difference in reported delay times are due to the alternative ways, defined above, in which the FAA and the BTS track delays.Average delay times for ten major U.S. airports, which are listed in Table 1, are summarized in Table 2.The delay times reported in Table 2 include departure, enroute and arrival delays.Table 3 shows the average percentage of delayed aircraft for each of the ten airports in Table 1, broken down by departures and arrivals, for the twelve months ending in October 2001. 14From Table 3, it is evident that the percentages of delayed departures and arrivals are similar in some cases, suggesting that delay is frequently incurred on departure and carries through to arrival.The percentage of delayed departures or arrivals in 2001 was lower than in 2000, which was a record year for all types of delays compared to the previous level set in 1990. 15e top ten airports with the most arrival delays in 2000, as defined by the inspector general, saw an increase of 24.2% since 1999. 16The FAA reported that over the entire NAS in 2000, 27.5% of all aircraft were delayed, canceled, or diverted. 16 summary, air traffic delays have been on a steady rise since the 1990s.A statement by the DOT 16 notes that according to BTS, the number of delayed aircraft has increased by 30% between 1995 and 2000.The report also shows that using FAA statistics, the delays increased by 90% during the same period, and flight cancellations soared 104 percent.The annual cost of delays in 1999 was just over 3.2 billion dollars.This compares to roughly 7.85 billion dollars in net profit for all airlines, representing a 27% drain on financial resources. 13udies have identified the stages of flight in which delays occur and the causal factors that result in delays.For example, the DOT 16 classifies delays as gate delay, taxi-out delay, airborne delay and taxi-in delay.Figure 1 shows their contribution to the total delay.Observe from the figure that 84% of all delays occur on the ground (gate, taxi-out, taxi-in), out of which 76% are prior to takeoff (gate, taxi-out), suggesting that focusing on ground delay prediction will have the most impact on improving forecasting algorithms. 16Surface movement inefficiencies are not the only reason for delays on the ground.Ground delay programs, enroute capacity constraints, aircraft maintenance issues, ground services (fuel, baggage and catering), customer service issues, late aircraft/crew arrival, and poor weather conditions elsewhere all contribute to surface   delays. 16The impact of the most common and important of these factors will be discussed.Weather is the main contributor to delays in the air traffic control (ATC) system as shown in Fig. 2. Traffic volume delays are caused by an arrival/departure demand that exceeds the nominal airport arrival rate (AAR)/airport departure rate (ADR).The demand may also exceed the airport capacity if AAR and ADR are reduced due to weather conditions at the airport, equipment failure or runway closure.ATC equipment outages are also responsible for a small number of delays.In addition to the above-listed causal factors for delays, introduction of new equipment and operational procedures have been known to contribute to the delays.For example, Fig. 3 shows that introduction of the Display System Replacement (DSR) program, which is designed to upgrade controller's displays, caused 21% of the increase in delay in 1999 since it required the controllers to learn a new system.Restrictions on Land And Hold Short Operations (LAHSO), a change of procedure, also contributed to an increase in delay.LAHSO is designed to permit simultaneous use of intersecting runways.The landing aircraft is instructed to stop just before the intersecting runway so that another aircraft may use it at the same time.To ensure safe operations, the FAA added restrictions to this policy in 1999, which effectively reduced the capacity of many large airports and increased delay in the NAS. 13 Delays may also be attributed to airline operations procedures. 13The first contributing factor is the organization of operations into a hub and spoke system by the airlines.The hub-spoke operations cause banks of aircraft to arrive together and then depart together.This type of operation is desirable from an airline point of view because it allows the passengers, aircraft and crew to be rerouted to various destinations.They also provide airlines the opportunity to consolidate passengers into some flights while canceling others.The main drawback of this procedure is that the airport experiences arrival and departure rushes with little resource utilization in the interim periods.The second factor is increased use of regional jets instead of turboprops.The turboprops required a smaller runway, climbed more slowly and flew at lower altitudes than the jets.These characteristics allowed them to be naturally separated from the higher altitude jet traffic.Increased numbers of smaller jets, which operate in the same flight regime as the larger jets, means more aircraft competing for the same airspace, thereby increasing congestion and delays.
Data CollectionTen major U. S. airports that experience significant delays were selected for the study of departure, enroute and arrival delays.These major hub airports, listed in Table 1, are responsible for a significant portion of the traffic in the NAS and they also bear the burden of a large portion of the delays.The data needed for the analysis of delays for these airports were extracted using the Post Operations Evaluation Tool (POET) for the three-week period spanning October 14, 2001 to November 3, 2001.The three-week duration was chosen to have enough data for statistically meaningful results and to make possible analysis of the data as a function of days of the week.POET is an analysis system developed under the FAA's Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) program.Since it is built on top of a relational database, users can easily query, filter, and visualize the flight information contained in the ETMS data archive using a variety of Fig. 3 Distribution of reasons for increases in delay in 1999. 13nteractive charts and tables.Analysis results can be aggregated by departure and arrival airports, filed arrival fixes, departure and arrival times, National Route Program (NRP)/non-NRP status, departure and arrival centers, and by the class of the user, among other functionalities.The POET server installed at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) archives a rolling 45-day set of ETMS data. 17e following data fields were extracted for each aircraft in the POET database:• identification code,• date of departure,• airport code,• scheduled time of departure,• actual time of departure,• scheduled flight time,• actual flight time,• scheduled time of arrival, and • actual time of arrival.It should be noted that the scheduled time of departure in the POET database is an Out time filed by the airline approximately 30 to 120 minutes before departure, plus an estimated taxi time.The actual time of departure in the database is the Off time, which is the time the aircraft lifts off the runway.The difference between the two is used as a measure of delay for the forecasting process.A bias correction for the difference between the actual and scheduled times can always be applied to improve the accuracy of the schedule-based prediction method.
ResultsThe data extracted from POET were analyzed to generate: tables that list the values of the delay metrics, described below, for the chosen ten airports for the 21 day period; bar charts that describe various attributes of traffic as a function of days of the week; and models of departure delay, enroute delay and arrival delay distributions.
Delay Statistics of Major AirportsThe delay metrics were generated for a typical day by first averaging for a day of operations and then averaging the result over the 21 days.The average number of operations for any day is determined as:m n f m i i = 1 1 (1)where i n is the number of departures or arrivals on the i th day and m is the number of days.The average delay for a day of operations at a particular airport is:i n j i j i n i = 1 ,(2)with delay defined as:i j s a i j t t , , ) ( = (3)Here, i n is the number of departures or arrivals on the i th day, s t is the scheduled departure and a t is the actual departure time of the j th aircraft on the i th day.The average over the m number of days can now be computed as:m f m i i = 1 2 (4)ƒ 2 is an average delay over the number of aircraft and the number of days at a specific airport.A third measure, ƒ 3 , is the percentage of aircraft departing late and is defined as follows:m d f m i i = 1 3 (5)where the percentage of aircraft departing late on a single day is:[ ] i n j i j i n d i > = 1 , 0 100 (6)The expression enclosed in the square brackets, [ ], is a logical expression.Following Iverson's notation, 18 the value is 1 if the expression is true and zero otherwise.The percentage of aircraft departing early can be determined by subtracting ƒ 3 from 100.The average amount of delay time for the aircraft that departed late is defined as:m l f m i i = 1 4 (7)where[ ] i n j i j i j i p l i > = 1 , , 0(8)and the number of delayed aircraft is:[ ] > = i n j i j i p 1 , 0(9)Similarly, the average amount of early departure time, with respect to the scheduled time of departure, for aircraft that departed early is defined as: (10)   wherem e f m i i = 1 5[ ] i n j i j i j i q e i = 1 , , 0(11)and the number of aircraft that departed early is:[ ] = i n j i j i q 1 , 0(12)The average amount of delay for each aircraft delayed fifteen minutes or more is defined as the ƒ 6 measure:m g f m i i = 1 6 (13) with [ ] [ ] = i i n j i j n j i j i j i g 1 , 1 , ,15 15 (14)The average delay of those aircraft that had the minimum delay on each day is found as follows:m a f m i i = 1 7 (15)where) ( min , 1 i j n j i i a = (16)Similarly, the average delay of the aircraft that had the maximum delay on given days is defined to be: The metrics ƒ 1 through ƒ 10 were computed for the departures out of the ten airports listed in Table 1, and a short definition of each metric is available in Table 4.These results are tabulated in the appendix in Table A1.Similar results for the arrival delays for arrivals to the ten airports are given in the appendix, Table A2.Table 5 summarizes the most important metrics: percentage of aircraft delayed more than 15 minutes (ƒ 9 ), and average delay time of delayed aircraft (ƒ 6 ).Comparing the data in Table 5 with the historical statistics in Tables 2 and3, it is seen that the average amount of delay for each aircraft delayed more than fifteen minutes (ƒ 6 ) is lower than in Table 2.The percentage of aircraft experiencing more than fifteen minutes of arrival or departure delay (ƒ 9 ) compares very well with the data in Table 3.The data in Tables A1 and A2 can also be used for ranking the ten airports in order of delay.Table 6 shows the rank based on the average departure delay, the percentage of aircraft departing late and the percentage of aircraft departing later than 15 minutes.Similar ranking is shown using arrival delays and percentage of aircraft arriving later than zero and 15 minutes.Each airport was ranked using the three parameters: ƒ 2 (Eq.( 4)), ƒ 3 (Eq.( 5)) and ƒ 9 (Eq.( 19)) independently, and the average rank was computed to assign the final rank shown in Table 6.Two of the mostly widely used and cited statistics in NAS system analysis are the percentage of aircraft delayed more than fifteen minutes (ƒ 9 ) and the average delay time of these aircraft (ƒ 6 ).This is because the FAA reports aircraft as delayed if they depart more than 15 minutes late.Tables 7 and8 show the percentage of aircraft that had departure delays, arrival delays, and enroute delays, and the average departure delays, arrival delays and enroute delays.The data in Table 7 pertain to the departures from the ten airports.Thus, the departure delays are counted at these airports while the arrival delays are counted at the various destination airports that the departing aircraft flew to.Complementing this, Table 8 shows the data for aircraft that arrived at the ten airports.The arrival delay for these aircraft is counted at the ten airports while the departure delay is counted at the other airports from which these flights originated.The percentage of delayed aircraft is computed as a simple average:   The departure delays, arrival delays and enroute delays in Tables 7 and8 are determined following the definitions of ƒ 11 and ƒ 12 in Eqs. ( 23) and (24).These tables show that the arrival delay times are strongly correlated to the departure delay times.This data again indicates arrival delay is similar in magnitude to the departure delay.The data also show fewer aircraft are delayed enroute compared to departing or arriving aircraft.In addition to the metrics discussed so far, the mean and standard deviation are important features of the delay distribution.The mean of the distribution is determined as:= m i i m i n j i j n f i 1 1 1 , 13(25)and the standard deviation, assuming a normal distribution, is determined as:( )1 1 1 1 2 13 , 14 = m i i m i n j i j n f f i (26)The mean and standard deviation of the departure, arrival and enroute delays are given in Tables 9 and10.Table 9 shows the data for the departures from the ten airports while Table 10 shows the data for the arrivals to the ten airports.The departure delay means in both tables show a positive bias, suggesting congestion at the airports results in more late departures than early ones.These tables show a part of the departure delay is absorbed in the enroute phase, which results in a smaller arrival delay.On average, the standard deviation value of departure delays out of these airports is 16 minutes and for arrival delays into these airports is 18 minutes.
Overall TrendsIn the previous section, traffic delay characteristics at the ten airports were examined using several metrics.In this section the focus is on aggregate statistics derived from the complete dataset, which includes all the traffic from the ten airports over the 21-day period.Figure 4 shows the percentage of aircraft as a function of departure and arrival delays.For example, the first light colored bar shows the percentage of aircraft, out of all the aircraft that departed from the ten airports over the 21-day period, that had more than 10 minutes of delay.The first solid bar shows the percentage of arrivals that had more than 10 minutes of delay.Note that departure delays are computed at the ten airports while the arrival delays are computed elsewhere (destination airports).The second set of bars show the percentage of aircraft that had more than 15 minutes of delay and so on.Observe from the figure that a slightly greater percentage of aircraft encounter arrival delays than experience departure delays.This may be due to those aircraft that experienced departure delays, which propagate through to become arrival delays, and those small number that did not experience departure delays but were subject to enroute delays or terminal delays, becoming arrival delays.It should be noted that the difference between the percentages of delayed departures and arrivals is rather small (less than 2), implying that most of the delay originates before departure.The average number of departures out of the ten airports as a function of the day of the week is shown in Fig. 5.To create the bar charts, the number of departures from the ten airports were summed up for one day of the week (for example, Wednesdays), and divided by the number of such days (number of Wednesdays in the 21-day dataset).The bar chart shows that traffic is less on Sundays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.It should however be noted that the difference between the minimum traffic on Sundays and the maximum traffic on Thursdays is only 9.8%.For each day of the week in the 21-day dataset, all departures from the ten airports that were delayed by more than 15 minutes were used to generate the bar charts in Fig. 6.The average percentage of aircraft delayed by more than 15 minutes was found to be 15.0%.This number agrees well with the average of the delayed departure percentages given in Table 3, and shows the variation from day to day is small.Observe that although the traffic volume is lower on Sundays (see: Fig. 5), the percentage of delayed aircraft in Fig. 6 is higher on Sundays.This trend is reversed on Tuesdays.A likely explanation for such a trend is the small variation in departures from day to day is not enough to reach a capacity threshold that will increase the number of delayed aircraft.Of all the aircraft that experienced delays greater than 15 minutes, their average delay is shown as a function of the day of the week in Fig. 7.It may be seen that the average delay is maximum on Wednesday, although the traffic is higher on Tuesdays and Thursdays.The variation in delay from day to day is small, and the average delay was found to be 32 minutes.The trends for aircraft originating at other airports and arriving at the ten chosen airports were found to be similar to those shown in Figs. 6 and7.The average percentage of arrivals delayed by more than 15 minutes for any given day of week was found to be 16% (compared to 15% for departing aircraft in Fig. 6).The average arrival delay for these aircraft was found to be 32 minutes, which is the same as that found for departing aircraft in Fig. 7.
Delay ModelingDelay can be modeled by assuming it to be a random variable that follows a statistical distribution.It can also be modeled via an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model based on past observations of delay or by establishing correlations with respect to predictable quantities.For example, it may be possible to predict departure delay as a function of departure demand.Only the first approach of modeling delay using density functions is described in this paper.To model departure delay for probabilistic demand forecasting methods, density functions were created using departure and arrival data for the ten airports over the 21-day period.The density functions are defined at each delay time as the proportion of all aircraft that departed or arrived that number of minutes late or early.A Normal density function was then computed from the mean and standard deviation of the raw distribution, and a least squares error minimization was performed to improve the fit with respect to the actual density function.A Poisson density function was also computed and error with respect to the actual density function was minimized.A Poisson distribution was found to better model departure delays, while a Normal distribution modeled enroute and arrival delays better.Figure 8 shows the density functions for departure delays, enroute delays and arrival delays for aircraft that departed from the ten airports.The departure delays are computed at the ten airports and the arrival delays are computed at their destination airports.Similar density functions are shown in Fig. 9 for all the aircraft that arrived at the ten airports.The arrival delays are computed at the ten airports while the departure delays are computed at the airports of origin.Observe that the density functions look similar in both the figures.Departure delay, enroute delay and arrival delay distributions at several individual airports were also found to be very similar to the average characteristics shown in Figs. 8 and9.This suggests that the distributions plotted are representative of all airports, not just the ten in the study.The mean departure delay, enroute delay and arrival delay for departing aircraft (Fig. 8) were  To model the departure distribution in Fig. 8a, a Normal distribution is assumed.The equation for this distribution is: where the mean 0 > µ . 19The Poisson density function is plotted along with the raw departure density function in Fig. 11a.To improve the error with respect to the raw distribution, the mean µ can be adjusted by using the Least Squares method.Let µ be the mean delay derived from the data.The correction to the mean can be computed in terms of the perturbation about the nominal Poisson distribution as:   Using Normal distribution models for the data in Fig. 8 shows that the standard deviation of enroute delay (7.38 minutes) is smaller than the standard deviation of departure delay (10.49minutes), which is smaller than the standard deviation of arrival delay (13.75 minutes).Similar results were also obtained for data shown in Fig. 9. Modeling of the departure delay density function using Normal and Poisson distributions revealed that a better fit is obtained using a Poisson distribution.The improvement in fit-error is 12% over modeling with the Normal density function.Best-fit solutions for enroute delay and arrival delay modeling were obtained using Normal density functions.
ConclusionsThis paper was devoted to the analysis of departure, enroute and arrival delays of aircraft that operated out of one of ten major U.S. hub airports with the objective of improving delay prediction.To put the results in perspective, historical delay data for these airports from past studies were summarized.Causal factors for the delays related to aircraft, airline operations, change of procedures and traffic volume were identified.All the results of delay analysis were based on traffic data derived from the Post Operations Evaluation Tool (POET) database for the ten airports in a 21-day period.Delay metrics, described in the paper, were computed for a typical day by first averaging for a day of operations and then averaging the result over the 21 days.The numerical results for the average duration of departure delay were found to be smaller than the historical delays, but the percentage of aircraft that experience departure or arrival delays was found to be in good agreement with the historical trends.The delay metrics were also used to rank the ten airports.LGA was ranked worst in departure delays while JFK ranked worst in arrival delays.The next two most delayed for departures were EWR and JFK, and for arrivals ORD and BOS.In addition to the delay characteristics of individual airports, aggregate statistics were derived from the complete dataset and presented as functions of the days of the week.It was shown that the percentage of aircraft delayed more than the FAA standard of 15 minutes was in agreement with the historical data.A small amount of variation was seen in the average number of departures, percentage of delayed departures and average departure delay (for the delayed aircraft) as a function of the day of the week.Stochastic modeling of delays was attempted by creating probability density functions using all the data over the 21-day period.The density functions were modeled using Normal and Poisson distributions based on the mean and standard deviations derived from the raw data, and were then improved by adjusting the mean and standard deviation values via a Least Squares method.It was shown that departure delay is modeled better using a Poisson distribution while the enroute and arrival delays are modeled better using Normal distributions.These models can be used to improve the accuracy of probabilistic departure time or sector arrival time forecasts.Fig. 11Fig. 1 Distribution of delays by phase of flight.16

additional metrics, ƒ 9 and ƒ 10 , for the percentage of aircraft that had delays greater than 15 minutes and 45 minutes are:

µ is the mean of the distribution and is the standard deviation.The mean of the departure distribution in Fig.8 is 3.91 minutes and the standard deviation is 16 minutes; however the raw departure density function and the Normal density function with the same mean and standard deviation do not coincide.To improve the delay model one can adjust the standard deviation and the mean by computing a perturbation about the nominal distribution as follows.Let the mean and the standard deviation of the nominal Normal distribution be µ and .The perturbation equation can be obtained in terms of the nominal mean and standard deviation as: dP is the error between the Normal density function and the raw density function at each delay time instant.Since an equation of the form given in Eq. (28) can be set up at each sampling instant, dµ and d can be computed using the Least Squares method.For the given data-set, dµ and d were found to be -5.45minutes and -5.52 minutes.These corrections resulted in the mean of -1.54 minutes and standard deviation of 10.49 minutes.The resulting Normal distribution is shown in of Fig.10.The improvement in fit error, measured as the sum of the squares of the errors, is 71% compared to the nominal Normal distribution.To determine if another model would better fit the data, a Poisson distribution model is examined next.If a random variable X has a Poisson distribution,

Figure 12 shows the Normal density function obtained by using the Least Squares technique using Eq.(28).The mean and the standard deviation values of -2.82 minutes and 11.20 minutes of the nominal Normal distribution were corrected by 0.36 minutes and -3.82 minutes which resulted in the mean and standard deviation values of -2.46 minutes and 7.38 minutes.The best-fit Normal density function reduced the fit error by 83% compared to that obtained using the nominal Normal density function.The best-fit Poisson density function could only lower the error by 53% compared to that obtained using the nominal Normal density function.Thus, the enroute delay distribution was modeled best by the Normal distribution.The arrival delay data, shown in Fig. 8, were modeled using the Normal density function and the Poisson density function.Best-fit was achieved with the Normal density function, as shown in Fig. 13, using the distribution whose mean and standard deviation were adjusted through Eq. (28).The mean and standard deviation of the nominal Normal distribution were 1.06 minutes and 18.74 minutes.Error minimization with respect to the raw arrival delay density function using the Least Squares method resulted in corrections of -3.79 minutes to the mean and -4.99 minutes to the standard deviation.The adjusted Normal distribution shown in Fig. 13 (LSQ Normal) has a mean of -2.73 minutes and a standard deviation of 13.75 minutes.The best-fit Normal distribution reduced the fit error by 78% compared to the nominal Normal distribution.
