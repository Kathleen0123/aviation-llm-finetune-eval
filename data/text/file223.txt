Con ict Probability EstimationThe con ict probability algorithm presented in 4 , which applied only to level ight, has been generalized to apply to non-level ight.That generalized algorithm is summarized in this section.A more detailed discussion will be presented in a future paper.Trajectory prediction is inexact, primarily because of wind modeling and prediction error and secondarily because of tracking, navigation and control error.The con ict probability algorithm requires a prediction of positions and velocities of a pair of aircraft at their point of minimum separation provided by C T AS and a statistical model of the prediction errors.Prediction errors can be represented as ellipses in the horizontal plane or as ellipsoids in three-dimensional space.Those error ellipsoids tend to have their principal axes in the along-track, cross-track, and vertical directions.Since aircraft are usually own at a constant airspeed or Mach n umber rather than a constant groundspeed, the e ects of wind modeling and prediction errors accumulate with time, particularly in the along-track direction.Figure 1 shows a typical example of the growth of two-dimensional 2D prediction error ellipses in the along-track direction.The trajectory prediction error for an aircraft will be modeled as normally distributed 5 , with zero mean and with a covariance that has eigenvectors in the alongtrack, cross-track, and vertical directions, as explained previously.The covariance matrix is therefore diagonal in a coordinate system aligned with the aircraft heading.If S is the diagonal covariance matrix, and R is the rotation matrix that transforms the heading-aligned coordinates to the reference coordinates, then the transformed covariance matrix isQ = RSR T 1
Combined CovarianceBecause the trajectory prediction errors are modeled as normally distributed, the two error covariances for an aircraft pair can be combined into a single equivalent covariance of the position di erence or the relative position of one aircraft with respect to the other.For present purposes, this combined covariance can be assigned to one of the aircraft, referred to as the stochastic" aircraft, and the other aircraft, referred to as the reference" aircraft, can be regarded as having no position uncertainty.Subscripts S and R will be used to designate the stochastic and reference aircraft, respectively.The combined prediction error covariance is then The cross-correlation term accounts for the fact that the wind modeling error is spatially correlated and a portion of its e ect cancels in the position di erence.In general, the combined error ellipsoid corresponding to M will no longer have principal axes aligned with the along-track and cross-track directions of either aircraft.Figure 2 shows an example 2D encounter geometry in the horizontal plane; the three-dimensional 3D case is more di cult to illustrate but similar in principle.The combined error ellipse is centered on the stochastic aircraft, and the circular con ict zone nominal 5 nmi radius is centered on the reference aircraft.The error ellipse corresponds to a probability density function that can be represented as a surface over the ellipse, where the total volume under the surface is unity.The probability of con ict at a particular time is the portion of that volume that is within the circular con ict zone, but this probability i s not as important a s t h e total probability of con ict for the encounter, which is discussed in the following paragraphs.M = Q S + Q R , Q SRIt is assumed that the aircraft velocities and prediction errors are constant during the encounter or period of potential con ict, which will be at least approximately  true for most aircraft pairs in free ight.Without these assumptions, an analytical solution is much more dicult or perhaps impossible to nd.Note that prediction errors due to planned turns or other maneuvers that will be completed before the encounter begins can be properly accounted for in the covariance matrices.The total probability of con ict for the encounter can then be determined as follows.Project the con ict zone along a line parallel to the relative v elocity to form an extended con ict zone, as illustrated in gure 2 for the 2D case.The con ict probability is equal to the portion of the volume under the probability density surface that is within this extended con ict zone.The coordinate transformation to be presented in the following paragraphs allows this probability to be determined analytically.
Coordinate TransformationThe con ict probability is di cult or impossible to determine analytically in the original coordinate system.It can be determined numerically, but a numerical solution is likely to be less accurate and much less e cient than an analytical solution.Such ine ciency is undesirable for an algorithm that is intended to run in real time for extended periods of time.Fortunately, a coordinate transformation has been found that allows an exact analytical solution for the case of level ight and a good  The coordinate transformation consists of a nonorthogonal transformation followed by an orthogonal transformation rotation, then a projection onto a plane.The nonorthogonal transformation transforms the combined error ellipse into the standard form of a unit sphere.The orthogonal transformation aligns the relative velocity with one of the coordinate axes.The projection projects the cylindrical con ict zone onto the plane normal to the relative v elocity.These coordinate transformations must be applied to the relative positions and velocities of the two aircraft, the combined error ellipse, and the cylindrical con ict zone.If T is a coordinate transformation matrix, and M is the covariance matrix in the original coordinate system from equation 2, then the combined error covariance in the transformed coordinate system is T M T T .A Cholesky decomposition or square-root" factorization of M is of the form M = LL T 3 where L is lower triangular.If the transformation matrix T is selected such that T = L ,1 4 then the transformed covariance matrix is T M T T = I 5 where I is an identity matrix.The combined error ellipsoid is then transformed into the standard form of a unit sphere.Figure 3 illustrates an example of transformed encounter geometry for the 2D case; the 3D case is similar in principle.In the original coordinate system, the cylindrical con ict zone is represented by the horizontal circles at the top and botton of the cylinder.In the new coordinate system, those circles become ellipses ellipsoids of zero thickness that remain in the horizontal plane for level ight but not necessarily for non-level ight.The con ict zone, which w as a circular cylinder in the original coordinate system, is therefore an elliptical cylinder in the transformed coordinate system.The details of these transformations will be presented in a future paper.Having the error ellipsoid in the form of a unit sphere simpli es the probability computation considerably because the corresponding 3D probability density function decouples into the product of three identical one-dimensional functions.For the 2D case, the probability density function can be represented as a radially symmetric surface over the error circle, where the total volume under the surface is unity.For the 3D case, the probability density function can be represented as a radially symmetric mass distribution, where the total mass is unity.In the transformed coordinate system, the extended con ict zone is still in the direction of the transformed relative v elocity.For the 2D case the con ict probability is still equal to the portion of the volume under the probability density surface that is within this extended con ict zone.An orthogonal transformation can be used to rotate the transformed coordinate system such that the relative v elocity i s i n t h e x direction.Note that a rotation will not change the shape of the error sphere.The rotation consists of two steps: rst, a rotation about the z axis such that the relative v elocity i s i n t h e xz plane; second, a rotation about the y axis such that the relative velocity in the x direction.An example of transformed 3D encounter geometry is illustrated in gure 4. The extended con ict zone is the projection of the cylindrical con ict zone in the direction of the relative velocity the x direction, which is perpendicular to the paper in gure 4. The view of the cylindrical con ict zone from the direction of the relative v elocity is therefore the cross-section of the extended con ict zone.The cylindrical con ict zone appears very distorted in the transformed coordinates because the combined vertical uncertainty 100 ft is usually much less than the horizontal uncertainty, s o t h e height of the cylinder gets magni ed in the transformation the distortion is actually worse than shown in the gure.The vertical velocity also gets magni ed.Note that the allowed cruise altitudes in Free Flight m a y b e in ner increments than the current increments of 1000 ft.For the important special case of level ight, the cylindrical con ict zone appears as a rectangle when viewed horizontally from the direction of the relative v elocity.The con ict probability then decouples into the product of vertical and horizontal con ict probabilities and can be determined exactly by the analytical methods presented previously 4 .For nonlevel ight, on the other hand, an exact analytical solution has not been found.Numerical integration could be used, but that would be numerically intensive, which is undesirable for an algorithm that is intended to run in real time for long periods.Fortunately, a v ery good analytical approximation can be determined by using a bounding rectangle around the cylindrical con ict zone, as illustrated in gure 4.The next step is to project the con ict-zone ellipses onto a plane normal to the relative v elocity.The coordinate transformation was de ned such that the transformed relative v elocity i s i n t h e x direction, so the ellipses must be projected onto the y-z plane.The derivation of this projection is algebraically very complex it will be left as an exercize for the interested reader, but the result is very simple.The projection onto the y-z plane is achieved by simply taking the y-z components of the vector to the center of the con ict-zone ellipses and the lower-right 2 2 yz submatrix of the representative matrix.A minimum bounding rectangle tangent to the pro-jection is then determined.Again, the details will be presented in a future paper.Because the probability density function decouples and the boundaries of the bounding rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes, the conict probability estimate simpli es to the product of two Gaussian cumulative di erences.This solution can be computed analytically.
Numerical ExamplesA set of four plots were generated to show t ypical conict probabilities as functions of time to minimum separation.The aircraft speeds were 480 kts in each case, except as noted.The con ict separation distance was 5 nmi, the legally required value for enroute airspace.The cross-track rms error was 1 nmi, and the along-track rms error started at zero and grew linearly at a rate of 15 kts, unless otherwise stated.These values are typical for cruise.This linear-growth model is typical but is not assumed or required by the algorithm.Cross correlation of wind errors was not modeled, but could be added without changing the algorithm.The complex nonlinear behavior of the con ict probabability function revealed by these examples underscores the need to incorporate the algorithm into the Con ict Probe.Figure 5 shows the e ect of minimum predicted separation on con ict probability.Con ict probability is plotted as a function of the time to minimum predicted separation, with the minimum predicted separation as a parameter, where the path-crossing angle is 90 deg.For small prediction times, the covariances are small and the con ict probabilities are a strong function of minimum predicted separation, ranging all the way from zero to one.For larger prediction times, the covariances grow and the con ict probability becomes a weaker function of the minimum predicted separation.The con ict probabilities converge and asymptotically approach zero as prediction time increases.Note that while the con ict probabilities decrease monotonically for minimum predicted separations of 0, 2.5, and 5 nmi, they rst increase to a maximum before beginning to converge toward zero for minimum predicted separations of 7.5 and 10 nmi.This behavior reects the fact that for prediction times up to about 25 min the e ect of random prediction errors increase opportunities for con ict more rapidly than they decrease it if the predicted separation is larger than the allowed legal separation of 5 nmi.Note that for an exact predicted collision, the probability of loss of legal separation 5 nmi decreases to 0.5 at a prediction time of about 30 min.Figure 6 shows the e ect of path-crossing angle on con ict probability.Con ict probability is plotted again as a function of the time to minimum predicted separa-  tion, but with the path-crossing angle as a parameter, where the predicted minimum separation is 0 nmi.As a point of reference, the curve for the path-crossing angle of 90 deg is identical to the corresponding curve of gure 5.As the prediction time increases, the con ict probability decreases faster for smaller path-crossing angles than for larger ones.As the path crossing angle approaches 180 deg a head-on encounter, the con ict probabilities remain high and almost independent of prediction time.This behavior re ects the fact that for a head-on encounter with small predicted separation and a constant rms cross-track error a collision is a near certainty regardless of along-track prediction arror.If cross correlation of wind modeling errors exist and are taken into account, however, these curves could be signi cantly di erent for path-crossing angles less than about 45 deg.In that case, a portion of the trajectoryprediction error would cancel in the position di erence, and the e ective error growth rate would be smaller.Hence the con ict probabilities for such smaller path angles would not decrease as rapidly as shown in gure 6.Figure 7 shows the e ect of constant cruise speed di erences for a small 15 deg encounter angle.All the curves are based on a predicted collision at constant altitude.One aircraft ies at 500 kts while the speed of the other aircraft is reduced in steps of 50 kts down to 300 kts.The gure shows that con ict probability decreases less rapidly with prediction time for larger speed di erences.This behavior can be understood by visualizing the encounter from the perspective of an observer riding on one of the aircraft.Having a large di erence in velocity at a shallow angle is similar to the case in which a faster aircraft overtakes a slower one on a converging path, diminishing the e ect of random along-track er- Figure 8 is an example of a cruise vs. descent encounter where one aircraft ies at constant altitude and the other ies rst at constant altitude and then begins a descent segment.The encounters occur during the descent, with a minimum predicted horizontal separation of zero and a path crossing angle of 90 deg.The predicted altitude separation at minimum horizontal separation is varied from 0 to 4000 ft in increments of 1000 ft.Both aircraft y at 480 kts.The descending aircraft descends at a nominal descent angle of 2.5 deg.During cruise the along-track rms error growth rate is 15 kts for each aircraft.During descent the along-track rms error rate increases to 20 kts and the error in the descent rate is assumed to have a constant rms value of 500 ft min.The predicted minimum horizontal separation occurs 7 min into the descent.The two-segment altitude pro le creates a discontinuity in the slopes of the con ict probability curves at the 7-min prediction time.The curves fall o more rapidly prior to this time and less rapidly thereafter, reecting the e ect of the higher error rates during descent.For the collision case, the con ict probability drops to 0.7 at a prediction time of only approximately 5 or 6 min.The rapid drop-o illustrates the di culty of accurately predicting con icts when at least one aircraft is in descent.Since computational e ciency is a major concern in a real-time air tra c control system, basic timing tests were performed on the con ict probability algorithm running on a Sun SPARC 2 0 w orkstation.These tests were for the con ict probability algorithm only and did not include trajectory prediction, wind modeling, or any other part of the problem.The average computation This time is two t o v e orders of magnitude faster than a n umerical solution, depending on the method and level of resolution of the numerical integration.Furthermore, it is fast enough to be used directly in a real-time system.The con ict probability algorithm is programmed in approximately 5000 lines of C++ code and is integrated into the con ict search and trial resolution process of CTAS.It is used in several ways to enhance the detection process as described in the next section.
Probability Filter for Con ict AnalysisCon ict detection consists of identifying all pairs of aircraft whose distance and altitude separations are predicted to be less than speci ed minimum values within the detection time horizon.A computationally e cient method for performing this task is described in a later section of this paper.In this deterministic phase of the con ict search, the calculated 4D trajectories used in the search are treated as if they predict the future position and altitude of each aircraft exactly, without any errors.The result of the deterministic search is an initial conict list, containing the pairs of aircraft that were found to violate the separation criteria.The next step in the con ict search is to incorporate the con ict probability analysis formulated in the preceding section.In the UPR DA Con ict Probe, con ict probabilities are not normally shown as numerical values on the controller's con ict list unless speci cally requested, but are indicated instead by a color code.A pair in the con ict list is colored red if the probability that the ity that a separation speci ed by the controller will be violated is greater than a threshold level of P cy 0:85.It should be noted that in UPR the controller may specify a separation that is larger than is required legally; for example, if legal separation is 5 nmi. the controller my c hoose 8 nmi as the separation that triggers display of a con ict pair in the list.A con ict pair is shown in white if its con ict probability is less than P cy .Finally, a con ict pair is not displayed in the con ict list if the con ict probability calculated for the controllerspeci ed separation is less than P min , where P min is in the range of 0.4-0.6, with a nominal value of 0.45.The interval between P min and P cy provides for the display of those con ict pairs which h a v e reasonable expectation to become candidates for resolution in the near future.Awareness of such con icts gives controllers additional time to formulate strategies for resolution.The values for P cy and P lr and their associated color codes white, yellow and red act as decision and priority indicators for controllers to initiate resolution.A v alue of 0.85 for these variables implies a false alert rate of 0.15, a value that is suggested by the resolution analysis described in the next section.Prior to computing the con ict probability, the initial state vector for each aircraft of a con ict pair is checked to determine if it satis es an eligibility condition for a valid probability calculation.The condition consists of checking if the initial state vector lies within speci ed maximum error tolerances of the planned trajectory derived from the ight plan.The check i s performed on the tracking error components de ned as the scalar di erences between components of the aircraft and the planned trajectory state vectors at the time of calculation.The tracking errors included in this check are cross-track position error, heading error, altitude error, and altitude-rate error.Only the rst three errors are used in the check if an aircraft is at or near its assigned altitude.The altitude-rate error replaces altitude error for an aircraft climbing or descending to a speci ed cleared altitude.Shadow testing of the Con ict Probe with live tra c indicates that acceptable choices for the maximum errors are 7 nmi, 25 deg, 500 ft, and 500 ft min, respectively.If the eligibility conditions are not satis ed, the conict probability algorithm is not applicable and is therefore not called by the con ict detection process.Failure to meet the eligibility conditions also implies that the intent of the aircraft cannot be reliably inferred from its ight plan at the current time.In this case, the con ict pair is excluded from the con ict list displayed to the controller, but only if time-to-go to the loss of predicted minimum separation is greater than a critical value, t pf , which is in the range of 6-8 min.However, for timesto-go less than t pf , the con ict pair is included in the controller con ict list, even if the eligibility condition is not met.This strategy is based on the observation that as prediction time declines below about 6 min the conict problem transitions from a strategic problem where close conformance with intent is required for reliability, to an essentially tactical problem where con icts are determined from current state only and not the ight plan.Ideally, the Con ict Probe should provide a seamless transition between strategic con ict detection with time horizons of at least 20 min to tactical con ict detection with time horizons in the range of 1-2 min.
Con ict ResolutionIn the preceding section con ict probability was used as a lter to screen potential con ict pairs before displaying them in the controller's con ict list.Furthermore, con ict pairs were color-coded in the con ict list to indicate high levels of con ict probability, thereby identifying those pairs that controllers should give priority for issuing resolution clearances.This section shows how the synthesis of 4D resolution trajectories can be combined with con ict probability analysis to provide a rational solution to the con ict resolution problem.Con ict resolution divides into two principal subproblems: a deciding the time to initiate a resolution maneuver and b selecting the maneuver to execute.The optimal time to initiate a maneuver is a tradeo between e ciency and certainty.The earlier a maneuver is initiated, the more e cient i t i s l i k ely to be in terms of extra distance own, but the less certain it is what maneuver is required or whether a maneuver is required at all.The later a maneuver is initiated, on the other hand, the more certain it is what maneuver is required, but the less e cient and the more severe the maneuver may h a v e t o b e .The earliest time that it is appropriate to issue a resolution is determined by specifying P r;min , which the con ict probability must equal or exceed before a resolution advisory is issued.The value of P r;min is xed by the maximum acceptable false alert probability, P f a = 1 , P r ;min , which lies in the range of 0.1-0.2, as will be explained later.For each con ict situation, there exist a potentially unlimited number of di erent 4D trajectories that can resolve the con ict.Fortunately, only the minimum separation distance achieved by a resolution trajectory is needed for con ict resolution analysis in the horizontal plane.If the resolution also involves a vertical maneuver, the minimum predicted vertical separation is also required and would add a second parameter.Consider rst the pre-resolution con ict probability, Pd min j d l ; t c , where d min is the predicted minimum separation just prior to the resolution, d l is the speci ed legal or, alternatively, the controller speci ed minimum separation assumed to be 5 nmi in the example to be discussed, and t c is time to go to the point of minimum separation.The function P also depends implicitly on numerous other parameters, such as route crossing angle, aircraft velocities and prediction error growth rates; but these assume xed values in a speci c encounter and are therefore irrelevant to this discussion.Now select any horizontal resolution trajectory that increases the predicted minimum separation from d min to d r;min and changes the time to go from t c to t rc .Then the post-resolution con ict probability can be written as P r d r;min j d l ; t rc , where P r is calculated by the same algorithm as P, but using trajectory parameters and error growth rates pertaining to the speci c resolution trajectory.The method of resolution adopted here consists of specifying a post resolution con ict probability, P rs , and then synthesizing a resolution trajectory that achieves it with the smallest value of t rc .It can be shown that values for P rs in the range of 0.05-0.15yield e ective resolution trajectories.Because of the non-linear, multi-parameter dependence of P r on the resolution trajectory, it is generally not possible to obtain a closed form solution for a resolution trajectory as a function of P rs .However, solutions can be generated easily by rst parameterizing the resolution trajectories using one or two parameters and then iterating on the parameters until the conditions for an acceptable solution are achieved.In a 2D resolution, for example, suitable parameters are the change in heading angle relative to the current heading, and the time at which to resume ight in the direction of a waypoint along the original route.The procedure will be illustrated for a predicted collision d min = 0 at a 90 deg crossing angle, with both aircraft ying at 480 knots.Figure 9 shows the geometry of the con ict trajectories as well as the geometry of a horizontal resolution trajectory that minimizes both the deviation from the original route and the increment in ight time.This type of resolution trajectory can be used for route crossing angles between about 30 deg and 140 deg.It is characterized by t w o parameters, the time-to-go, t rc , to the point of minimum separation, and the required minimum separation distance, d r;min .Under the assumption that the prediction error growth rate for the resolution trajectory is the same as for the original con ict trajectory, and that the di erence in the geometry of the trajectories is small, as is the case here, the post-resolution con ict probability function can be adequately approximated by the pre-resolution con ict probability function.These conditions allow one to calculate the required minimum resolution distance, d r;min , as function of time-to-go, t c , to the point of predicted minimum separation, d min , for any v alue of P rs , using a single family of curves such as shown in gure 5. Thus, if the post-resolution con ict probability, P rs , i s c hosen to be a particular value, then d r;min can be found for any t c by i n terpolation at P rs on the family of curves in gure 5.This process can easily be automated for commonly occuring con ict situations.The middle curve i n gure 10 represents a solution obtained by this process for P rs = 0 : 1 and an along-track error growth rate of 15 kts.The solutions for 10 and 20 kts are also shown.Note that the greater the error rate is, the steeper is the rise of the d r;min curves.Equivalently, for a xed value of prediction time, the lower the error rate is, the smaller and less costly the resolution maneuver can be to achieve a speci ed value of post-resolution con ict probability.This result clearly shows the operational and economic value of increased prediction accuracy in the design of a con ict resolution system.The useful range in prediction time to minimum separation of each solution is limited to a maximum value, t r;max , determined by the speci ed value of false alert probability, P f a .The e ect of two v alues of false alert probabilities, P f a =0 : 2and 0.3, on t r;max are investigated in gure 10.For the 15-kt error growth rate, the value of t r;max corresponding to a chosen value of P f a is obtained from gure 5 as follows.Locate the probability value of 0.8 or 0.7, corresponding to a false alert rate of 0.2 or 0.3 on the ordinate and determine the point o f i nterception of these ordinate values with the appropriate d min curve.Then read o the corresponding values of t r;max = 15 min and 18.7 min on the abscissa. .This result simpli es the logic of the resolution process.The maximum value of d r;min depends on P f a but is independent of error growth rate and t r;max .For example, for P f a =0 : 2, the maximum value of d r;min is a constant 10 nmi while t r;max changes from 11.3 min to 22.5 min as the error growth rate decreases from 20 kts to 10 kts.Finally, i t i s o f i n terest to note that the maximum value of d r;min of 10 nmi is twice the value of the legal separation of 5 nmi.The 5 nmi bu er protects against errors in the execution of the resolution trajectory, which includes the usual trajectory prediction errors.The resolution trajectory for this case is shown in gure 9.It is drawn to an exaggerated scale in the cross Finally, the functional dependence of d r;min on t rc is seen to be slightly non-linear.However, in a real-time algorithm for automated con ict resolution, a linear approximation of this relationship would be entirely justied, thereby yielding a closed form solution for d r;min as a function of t rc .An alternative resolution method based on an optimal control formulation of this problem has also been developed 6 .It involves formulating a cost function for evaluating the cost of resolution maneuvers and then calculating the manuever that minimizes the cost.In addition to generating optimum" resolution manuevers, the method also has the advantage of yielding the false alert and post resolution con ict probabilities, P f a and P rs , respectively, as part of its solution.When this method was applied to the example problem described earlier in this section, it yielded values of approximately 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, for these parameters.These results were the basis for the choices of P f a and P rs in the example problem.Furthermore, the functional dependence between d r;min and prediction time for the optimum resolutions were also found to be nearly linear.This result further justi es the linear approximation proposed in the preceding method.
Architecture of Con ict ProbeA Con ict Probe, including the con ict probability algorithm, has been implemented as an automation tool within CTAS.It shares approximately 90 of the software with the other CTAS tools TMA, DA, FAST.The foundation for all CTAS tools, including the Con ict Probe, is the four-dimensional 4D trajectory modeling, analysis and computation module referred to as trajectory synthesis TS and route analysis RA.The TS RA algorithms generate predicted 4D trajectories for every aircraft within a region of airspace, which may consist of an enroute Center, a terminal area such a s a TRACON, or a combination of enroute and terminalarea airspace.In order to serve the di erent requirements of each CTAS tool with a single, uni ed trajectory analysis system, the TS RA design uses a scalable multi-workstation architecture to achieve both high computational speed and high prediction accuracy.TS RA recomputes refreshes the predicted trajectories of all radar-tracked aircraft with an update cycle that essentially matches the radar update cycle of 12 s.For Center tools that use tracking data from enroute radars, the trajectory update cycle is approximately 10 s.It is about 5 s for terminal area tools using terminal area radars.The rapid update of trajectories ensures that all available sensor information is utilized in the calculation of the predicted trajectories.Therefore, CTAS advisories, including the con ict list derived from these trajectories, will adapt to changes in the current states of aircraft as rapidly as these state changes are re ected in the radar track data, ight-plan amendments, or other parameters.The rapid update cycle of 4D trajectories has proven to be fundamental to the operational e ectiveness and controller acceptance of all CTAS tools.It has also been found to provide speci c bene ts for the Con ict Probe.A block diagram of the CTAS architecture is shown in gure 11.The diagram is a simpli cation of the actual software architecture in that it does not explicitly show the communication-oriented processes or their interaction with the algorithmic processes.Each of the blocks in the diagram represent separate Unix processes which may b e run on separate workstations or processors.In the NASA prototype, the system is implemented on a network of Sun Ultra workstations.The number of processors dedicated to TS RA can be scaled to the maximum number of aircraft tracks that must be handled.For a single enroute Center with a maximum numberof tracked aircraft of between 300-400, the four-processor con guration shown in gure 11 is adequate to update all 4D trajectories within 6 s of receiving each radar track.Additional processors can be added if the track count exceeds 400.The TS RA processors generate trajectories asynchronously, thus emulating the operation of a parallel computer.Load-balancing software automatically maintains an equitable distribution of tracks among the available processor.A TS RA processor can also be added or removed without disrupting real-time operation.The TS RA algorithm running in each processor contains about 110k lines of C code.The 4D trajectories generated by the TS RA processor are accessed by the software modules that generate controller advisories for the three CTAS tools, UPR DA, TMA and FAST.Each tool has associated with it the special algorithms that generate advisories for that tool.Thus, FAST advisories are generated by an algorithm that optimizes runway allocation and arrival sequences.FAST also has its own embedded conict detection and resolution scheme.TMA advisories are generated by a dynamic scheduling algorithm that meters tra c through meter gates.Finally, UPR DA's advisories of predicted con icts and trial resolutions are generated by a con ict detection and analysis module that will be described further in the next section.The software also provides graphical user interfaces GUI for each tool.The acronyms for the interfaces and the controller specialists who use them are shown in the gure.For FAST and TMA the interfaces are used by the tra c management coordinators.For UPR DA the interface provides the capability that would be required by an area supervisor or sector controller.The code count in thousands of lines for each tool and process is also given in gure 11.The communications process not shown in the gure adds another 100K lines to the code count.While all three tools collectively depend on the trajectory data generated by the TS RA processors, the tool-speci c processors are independent of each other and run asynchronously on separate workstations.The modularity of the CTAS hardware and software architecture o ers several installation options, which can be used to trade o reliability on the one hand and economy and integrability on the other.For example, if UPR DA and TMA are installed at a Center on independent networks of workstations, including separate TS RA processors, software or hardware failures in one network will impact the operation of only the tool served by that network.The increased operational reliability of this con guration, however, has the disadvantage of making the integration of TMA and UPR DA functions, which is required for the operation of the Descent Advisor DA, far more di cult.Alternatively, if UPR and TMA are installed on the same network, as shown in gure 11, the number of workstations required to operate the tools is reduced signi cantly.The most important advantage of this single network con guration is that it greatly simpli es the integration of con ict probing and tra c management TMA as required for the operation of the DA tool.The main disadvantage is that failure of the network or software would cause both tools to fail.
Trajectory ModelingSince knowledge of 4D trajectories is a basic requirement for all automation tools in CTAS, much e ort has been devoted to developing computationally e cient and accurate methods for synthesizing such trajectories.The problem of synthesizing 4D trajectories and evaluating their prediction accuracy has been examined in a series of reports and papers 7, 8, 9 .The real-time algorithm based on these methods has been a part of the CTAS software since 1990 and currently supports the operation of CTAS at ve enroute Centers and ve TRACON's.Its prediction accuracy is under continuous scrutiny a t NASA and the eld sites, and performance enhancements are incorporated in periodic updates of CTAS software.Its accuracy for con ict prediction was evaluated in ight tests at the Denver Center in 1996 10 .Here a brief review is given of the analytical and computational methods for generating the trajectories and of the considerations that led to the choice of these methods.The trajectory synthesis in CTAS uses point mass equations of motion to model vertical and longitudinal accelerative maneuvers and concatenated segments of straight lines and circular arcs to model horizontal maneuvers and ight paths.The equations of motion are _ V T = T , D=m , g sin a , _ V w cos a 6_ h = V T sin a 7 _ S = V g 8 L = mg 9 R = V 2g =g tan max 10 where V T is true airspeed, T is thrust, D is drag, L is lift, m is mass g is gravitational acceleratiopn, a is ight path angle relative to airmass, V w is wind speed component in ight direction, h is altitude, S is distance along ight path, max is the maximum bank angle, R is the radius of a circular turn, and V g is ground speed.The force balance equations 6 and 9 directly relate the normal vertical and longitudinal accelerations to the principal forces on an aircraft, namely, lift, drag and thrust.Furthermore, the pseudo-force contributed by altitude-dependent horizontal wind elds when an aircraft is changing altitude is accounted for by the last term in equation 6.This wind shear force plays a signi cant role in the accurate prediction of climbs and descents.Horizontal paths are synthesized by a specially developed circle geometry engine," which consists of a set  of closed-form non-iterative algebraic and trigonometric functions 8 .The engine generates horizontal paths of concatenated lines and tangent circular arcs as solutions to various types of area navigation and tra c management problems.These include waypoint-to-waypoint guidance, path stretching maneuvers, and many t ypes of curved approaches and climbouts.Radii of circular turn arcs are calculated from the maximum allowed bank angle and an estimate of the ground speed in the turn, as given by eq.10.Trajectories are generated by n umerically integrating the three di erential equations using a 2nd order Runge-Kutta method with variable time-steps 7 .For generating climbs and descents, thrust levels and functions relating calibrated airspeed Mach number to altitude must be speci ed.Flight path angle may also be used as a climb descent control parameter.Ground speed is calculated from true airspeed, wind speed, wind direction, and airspeed direction by solving the well known wind triangle equation 8 .The position in the horizontal plane is determined from the known value of S a t a n y time and the parameters de ning the horizontal ight path.In order to generate all types of trajectories for hundreds of aircraft at a high update rate, the trajectory synthesis software has been written to achieve both high computational speed and high accuracy.For example, if the synthesis algorithm is generating a trajectory segment wherein the airspeed, altitude and heading are being held constant such as in cruise ight, it skips the aircraft performance models and increases the integration step size to 240 s.If the trajectory segment is a deceleration, it uses the performance model and reduces the step size to 30 s.Since the model equations include the lift, drag and thrust characteristics that are unique to each aircraft, synthesized trajectories based on these equations are guaranteed to stay within an aircraft's ight and performance envelope, resulting in yable trajectories.This characteristic of the model has contributed perhaps more than any other to the operational e ectivenes of the CTAS automation tools.It ensures that air tra c clearances, pilot procedures, and airline preferred operational procedures during climbout and descent are transformed into 4D trajectories that are both yable as well as likely to own by a particular aircraft.Furthermore, trajectory synthesis that incorporates models of aircraft performance and forces emulates trajectory algorithms in modern ight management systems FMS, thus permitting CTAS to accurately replicate FMS guidance modes.Recent eld tests have demonstrated that the trajectory synthesizer in CTAS can be con gured to accurately predict the climb and descent trajectories of aircraft both equipped and unequipped with an FMS. 9 .In summary, extensive operational experience has shown that the method gives accurate trajectories over the full range of problems encountered in normal aircraft operations.
Con ict Search AlgorithmAn e cient con ict prediction and analysis algorithm for the UPR DA Con ict Probe has been developed and implemented within the CTAS architecture and software.The design of the algorithm was driven by 3 criteria: e ciency, user exibility, and completeness.These criteria and their in uence will now be discussed.E ciency is the most in uential factor in the design of the con ict prediction algorithm.The search for conicts requires that every aircraft in the enroute Center be probed for con icts against every other in less than the radar update cycle of approximately 12 s.Furthermore, enough time must be left in the radar update cycle for processing of inter-process messages, advisories, and trajectory updates.The maximum number of pair-wise trajectory comparisons required for n aircraft is equal to the number of distinct pairs of aircraft in a group of n and is found by combinatorial analysis to be nn ,1=2.This translates to nearly 80,000 pairwise comparisons for 400 aircraft.Each trajectory comparison could be made by deriving a closed form solution for minimum separation, or it can be made by separation calculations at discrete, closely spaced time instants along the trajectory.A closed form solution for minimum separation is in itself a complex problem, especially when aircraft dynamics and routing have to be considered.It has been determined that solving explicitly for minimum separation is not feasible for complex 4D trajectories and high tra c volume.The alternative of computing separation at discrete intervals along the trajectory is a simple calculation, but if repeated too often, is also computationally intensive.The con ict search algorithm implemented in UPR DA employs discrete comparisons, but with measures taken to limit the number of calculations required.Three means of limiting computational load are employed in the search algorithm: trajectory pair pruning, minimizing separation computations, and timeskipping.Trajectory pair pruning determines if two trajectories are potentially in con ict and in need of further examination.This is accomplished through a simple set of heuristics which determine if the trajectories are spatially exclusive in either altitude or horizontal position.For example, if two enroute aircraft are cruising at assigned altitudes separated by at least the minimum required altitude separation, and will continue to y at those altitudes throughout the airspace, there is no potential for con ict, and no need for discrete separation comparisons along the trajectories.Similarly, if two horizontal trajectories are enclosed in rectangles, and these rectangles are horizontally separated by the required amount, there is no potential for con ict.Every pair searched is rst tested for altitude separation; if a con1 ict cannot be ruled out by the altitude test, the horizontal rectangle test is performed next.The horizontal rectangle test is comprised of testing for y northward separation rst, followed by a test for x eastward separation due to the majority of tra c owing East-West.The fraction of trajectory pairs which are pruned with these two tests varies with tra c mixture ascents, descents, cruise, but is approximately 60-80 of all trajectory pairs.Thus, for 400 aircraft, the set of trajectory pairs remaining to be tested further is between 16,000 and 32,000 pairs.While this number is considerably reduced, the remaining pairs must be tested by comparing 4D trajectories, a computationally costly process.Synthesis of 4D trajectories by the TS RA process yields state information for each aircraft at time steps of 10 s along the trajectory.The components of the state vector used in the con ict search are: x, y, h, and time.The rst method used to reduce computational load in the 4D search i s to minimize separation computations.This is a process of eliminating computations based on the result of computations already performed for a time step.For instance, if at a given time step, two aircraft are separated by more than the required altitude, it is not necessary to calculate the horizontal separation.Furthermore, the sum of the squares of x and y separation is only calculated if altitude separation is less than required, and if both x and y separation is less than the required horizontal separation; the sum of the squares is only compared to the square of the required separation if it is the minimum separation thus far on the trajectory.By this process, it is only required to compute the minimum horizontal separation once for each pair in con ict.In the third process of reducing computational workload of the 4D search, referred to as time-skipping, steps described above are skipped if it is determined from the previous step that no con ict is possible given aircraft performance.For example, two aircraft separated horizontally by 200 nmi, at a given step, will not be in con ict on the next step.Conservative estimates of aircraft performance are used to determine how many steps can be skipped.These estimates are in the form of assumed maximum altitude and horizontal closure rates.Altitude closure is assumed not to exceed 10,000 ft min, while horizontal closure rate is assumed to be less than 0.33 nmi s, or about Mach 2 at standard sea level conditions.These closure rates are used to calculate the increment in time at which there is potential for a con ict.The greatest increment in time to potential con ict, determined from the horizontal and altitude closure rates, is converted into an equivalent n umber of steps to skip, and the search continues at that time on the trajectories.This process is handled e ciently by storing the time steps in a dynamically allocated array o f pointers rather than a linked list, allowing direct access to time steps via the array index time step index.The design requirement for adjustability of minimum required altitude separation as a function of ight phase level ight, non-level ight meant required separation for a trajectory pair could change during the search of a trajectory pair.This is accounted for by creating a list of separation transition times and separation values corresponding to each c hange in required altitude separation throughout the duration of the search, prior to pairwise comparison.A single time comparison is needed to determine the required separation, rather than evaluation of the ight phase of each trajectory, a t each time step.Finally, con ict prediction software must be complete and dependable.While some missed con icts are unavoidable e.g. when the intended path of the aircraft is unknown or is changed after a con ict search, it is essential to take measures which guarantee that all potential con icts are detected in every search cycle.The simplicity of the search algorithm, and the conservative choice of parameters used in the pruning process ensure completeness and dependability.Once a potential con ict pair has been identi ed, the last step in the detection process consists of computing the con ict probability for the pair.The con ict probability computed during each con ict search cycle 6 s is based on the most recent 4D trajectory predictions and thus re ects changes in predicted minimum separation due to radar noise, etc.The raw con ict probability values are smoothed by a rst order lag lter prior to evaluation by the probability lter decision logic described in a preceding section.A lter time constant o f 18 s has been found to provide an acceptable compromise between responsiveness and smoothness.Furthermore, the software contains logic to enhance the temporal stability of the con ict list by restricting the list to include only those predicted con icts which continue for a speci ed number of consecutive search cycles.Two t ypes of con ict searches are implemented using the preceding algorithm: global search and trial planning search.The global search employs a 12 s update rate and searches the nn , 1=2 set of trajectory pairs previously described.The trial plan search operates on a rapid, 1 s update due to response time requirements.Trial planning is a function used by controllers to evaluate if a controller's proposed resolution of a con ict is itself con ict free.A trial plan consists of a controllerselected change in speed, altitude, and or route of an aircraft currently in con ict.An aircraft selected by a controller for trial planning is handled by a separate search procedure.This procedure requires only a 1-vs-n aircraft search but a much higher update rate of 1 s.The high repetition rate of the trial planning search gives nearly instantaneous response to controller changes in the trial plan.The con ict prediction process has been implemented in a CTAS software process called PFS C, containing approximately 20K lines of C code, including the con ict search process approximately 3K lines.It constitutes the largest element in the UPR DA block of gure 11.PFS C consists of the two con ict search procedures previously described global and trial planning, the con ict probability algorithm described in a previous section, and other functions handling advisory processing, inter-process messaging, and trajectory updates.The con ict search algorithm has demonstrated the performance required for the Con ict Probe.The performance of the search algorithm is gauged by the time per trajectory pair, and has been measured to be in the 45-55 s range 30 min prediction interval for a Sun Microsystems Ultra 170E 340 MIPS.Approximately 40 of this time is spent performing pairwise 4D trajectory comparisons, while 10 is spent pruning trajectory pairs from the process.The remaining 50 of the time is accounted for by overhead: copying time steps into dynamically allocated arrays from linked lists and binary tree traversal to access aircraft information.This time per trajectory pair and the percentage of trajectories pruned from the prediction process can be used to determine the maximum number of aircraft that can be probed for con icts within 6 s.This number is in excess of 800 aircraft and suggests that the Con ict Probe can handle the combined aircraft in two enroute Centers in less time than the radar update period of 12 s.Actual observed performance of the Con ict Probe receiving live tracking data from Denver Center has been 1.4 s to process 380 aircraft.
Concluding RemarksA rational foundation for the design of a Con ict Probe with long detection time horizons has been developed by combining 4D trajectory prediction with analytical models of prediction errors and con ict probability.The CTAS software provides an e cient platform for the realization of this design.By utilizing 90 of existing CTAS software, the Con ict Probe required the development of only two new processes, a generic conict search engine and the con ict probability algorithm, which together added about 30,000 new lines of C code to CTAS.Signi cant bene ts arise from the insertion of a Con ict Probe within CTAS.It o ers the exibility o f using the Con ict Probe as a standalone tool for Center controllers or using it as an integrated tool with the Decent Advisor and the Tra c management Advisor.Since the CTAS trajectory synthesizer generates accurate 4D trajectories for an entire ight pro le, from lifto to nal approach, the Con ict Probe can be used in all regions of airspace.This helps to remove signi cant boundary constraints between enroute and terminal-area airspace.By allocating con ict search and 4D trajectory synthesis, the two most computationally intensive processes in con ict probing, to separate workstations, the Conict Probe is able to search up to 800 aircraft tracks for con icts within 10 s.Thus, the Con ict Probe bene ts from the mature trajectory synthesis and scalable multiworkstation architecture of CTAS, which have been in operational use at several Centers and TRACONS for several years.The Con ict Probe is fully merged within CTAS and will be included in future CTAS software releases starting in July 1997.It has been adapted to the airspace of the Denver and Fort Worth Centers, and eld evaluation is scheduled to begin at both Centers this summer.Figure 1 :1Figure 1: Trajectory prediction error ellipses
