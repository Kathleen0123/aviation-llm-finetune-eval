The TaskThe task was a 20 ft dash-and-stop task performed at a constant altitude of 23 ft as shown in Figure 1 along the center of a runway.The piloted task started with a 20 ft translation towards the desired hover position situated in front of the helicopter's initial hover position, followed by 20 seconds of stationkeeping.The stationkeeping point was denoted by a series of four walls located 100 ft to the right and 100 ft in front and positioned at an angle of 45 degrees.At the desired stationkeeping point, the pilot should see the walls "edge on" out the right window.At the proper position, a building in the background appeared in the middle of the two inner walls.The walls were spaced such that the distance between the two inner walls translated to a distance of *5 ft with respect to the desired stationkeeping point in the axis of travel.Likewise, the distance between the two outer walls translated to a distance of + 10 ft with respect to the desired stationkeeping point in the axis of travel.A bob-up target was placed in the center of the runway and various red cones were placed on the runway visible through the right chin window for additional visual cueing.,Pilots were instructed to complete the dash-and-stop task in one smooth maneuver within the performance standards shown in Table 1.A sum-of-sines, Table 2, was added to the pilot's stick input to simulate wind gusts.Four experienced test pilots participated in the test.Each pilot practiced with randomly selected motion configurations at the beginning of each session.During the data collection, each pilot evaluated the motion configurations in a random order.The pilots were asked to fly each motion configuration three times and to evaluate the third repetition.Pilots were asked to give handling qualities ratings (HQRs)* and motion fidelity scale (MFS) ratings as shown in Table 3.A questionnaire was also given to elicit comments from the pilots regarding control strategy and motion fidelity.
Test FacilitiesThe NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) was used for this investigation, which is shown in Figure 2.The cockpit was oriented such that the longitudinal axis of the simulator cab traveled along the beam which has a usable travel of 40 ft.The large longitudinal travel of the VMS allowed for the 20 ft dashand-stop task without any motion cue attenuation.The motion system responses were collected using white noise with a Gaussian distribution and checked with frequency response technique developed for system identification called CIFERog.For this investigation, each motion axis had an equivalent time delay of 60 msec.The visual FOV of the helicopter cab is shown in Figure 4.The visual system was an Evans and Sutherland ESIG 4530 image generator.The out-the-window scene was presented on four monitors with a collimation/beam-splitter system.The visual system time delay was measured at 60 msec, which matches the equivalent time delay in the pitch and longitudinal motion axes.
Test ConfigurationsTwo second-order washout filters, Figure 3, were developed for this investigation.A pitch washout filter generated the pitch motion commands, and a coordinated longitudinal washout filter provided the longitudinal motion to counteract the leans due to pitch.Two pitch washout filter configurations and eleven longitudinal washout filter configurations, shown in Tables 3 and4 respectively and presented in Figure 5, were selected to investigate the interaction between pitch motion and longitudinal motion.Each configuration consisted of the gain and filter frequency for the respective washout filter.The configurations were selected to represent low, medium, and high-motion fidelity as defined in Reference 10.
ResultsFour pilots took part in this test.Their average MFS ratings and the average HQR are shown in Figures 6 and7 respectively.All pilots rated the fixed-base case as low fidelity.In general, the amount of longitudinal platform motion increases as both the longitudinal filter's predicted fidelity and the pitch filter's predicted fidelity increases, i.e., increasing motion gain and decreasing phase distortion.However, as the amount of required longitudinal motion increases any parasitic differences in the dynamics between the pitch and longitudinal motion become exacerbated and potentially objectionable.Pilots commented on the sharpness of the motion cues due to the high gains.This is evident in the full-motion case (Al, Tl) in that the pilots felt the motion cues to be objectionable and rated it as low fidelity.As pitch motion is attenuated (A3, Tl), the longitudinal platform motion decreased and artifacts such as above were reduced significantly which resulted in an improved motion fidelity rating.In both the full and the attenuated pitch motion cases, the motion cues became objectionable when the longitudinal phase distortion was 80 degrees at 1 rad/sec (co% = 0.9). Figure 8 shows the average MFS as a function of co,.As expected, the MFS decreases as longitudinal phase distortion is increased regardless of pitch motion.This is consistent with the roll-lateral motion requirements.In both the full and the attenuated pitch motion cases, it is clear that pilots felt the motion cues to be objectionable when little coordinated motion was provided, i.e., cases where the longitudinal motion gain was at or below 0.2.This is consistent with Schroeder2 and Chung' in their roll-lateral motion fidelity requirement investigations.Figure 9 shows the average MFS 'as a function of G,.For the attenuated pitch motion case (A3), MFS ratings generally decrease as longitudinal motion gain decreases.Again this is consistent with roll-lateral motion requirements.For the full pitch motion case (Al), there is no clear trend due to the low rating for the (Al, T3) case where it is expected to be rated medium fidelity.Undesired motion artifacts might have played a role in receiving the low fidelity rating while the longitudinal motion gain is still considerably high at 0.8.One observation is made from Figure 6 when comparing the average MFS between the full pitch motion (Al) and the attenuated pitch motion (A3).For the cases that represent the medium and high fidelity region, i.e., cases T2, T3, T5, T6, the average MFS ratings for the attenuated pitch motion case are noticeably improved when compared with the full pitch motion case.This improvement may be contributed to less pitch motion resulting in less "leans".Therefore any objectionable situations would be expected to occur less frequently, and consequently result in the noticeable improvement in MFS ratings.For both the full and attenuated pitch motion cases, the averaged HQRconsistently followed the averaged motion fidelity ratings, i.e., HQR improves when MFS improves.Concludine Remarks 1) Large phase distortion in longitudinal motion due to the pitch motion is detrimental to the motion fidelity.Pilots found it to be objectionable.This is consistent with the roll-lateral motion requirements.2) Ratings generally improved as the longitudinal motion gain increased until the undesired motion artifacts became noticeable.3) Additional testing is recommended to further investigate the pitch-longitudinal motion cueing fidelity requirements.
