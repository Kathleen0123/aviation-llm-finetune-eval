ScopeThese simulation activities, referred to as X3, were conducted during the second half of 2020 and completed in December 2020.X3 was an initial opportunity to assess the UAM airspace system developed by the Air Traffic Management -eXploration (ATM-X) Project's UAM Sub-Project (SP) in collaboration with National Campaign Sub Project's Airspace Test Infrastructure (ATI) team.The capabilities provided by the airspace partners were tested during these simulation activities.In X3, the UAM SP executed initial lab simulations with NC-DT airspace partners to test and demonstrate their capabilities and components prior to flight activities.The NC SP's ATI team was responsible for providing data collection capabilities for X3.In addition, the ATM-X UAM SP facilitated the connection of NC-DT airspace partners to the UAM airspace system and simulation platform.The X3 simulation started with eleven NC-DT airspace partners.None of the 11 airspace partners completed all the available testing with UAM Airspace Simulation Platform.More details are provided about the number of completed tests in the Results section.
Requirement ProcessThe UAM SP and NC SP's ATI teams collaborated to gather initial internal (NC, NASA) and external (FAA, Airspace Partners) requirements and capabilities based on the NC goals, objectives, success criteria, and scenarios, which served as the foundation of the X3 simulation activities.Figure 1 shows the system architecture used to meet these requirements.

Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS)Enables a PSU to identify other PSUs with active operations or subscriptions in the area of interest.
Constraint SubmitterGenerates an airspace constraint with defined spatial and temporal boundaries and distributes it to the PSU Network.
Provider of Services for UAM (PSU)A PSU is an entity that supports UAM operators with meeting UAM operational requirements that enable safe, efficient, and secure use of the airspace [2].A PSU:1. Provides a communication bridge between federated UAM actors, PSU to PSU via the PSU Network, to support the UAM operator's ability to meet the regulatory and operational requirements for UAM operations 2. Provides the UAM operator with information gathered from the PSU Network, about planned UAM operations so that UAM operators can ascertain the ability to conduct safe and efficient missions The Application Programming Interfaces (API) for each interface identified in the system architecture were defined in a GitHub repository which was available to all airspace partners.Links to all applicable API are included in Table 2 GitHub links for the different interfaces in X3 simulation environment.The ASTM API [6] was originally written for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) [5] and the UAS Service Supplier (USS) in that architecture.For X3, the same API was used, and 'USS' and 'PSU' were used interchangeably.In future, 'USS' and 'PSU' will not be interchangeable in actual applications and operations.
System RequirementsTo support the System Architecture, there were two categories of System Requirements; UAM Airspace Simulation Platform Requirements and Airspace Partner Requirements.The first category consisted of requirements to provide the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform with the services necessary to execute and collect data for the scenarios to meet the minimum success criteria.These included requirements for providing airspace definitions (such as airspace classes and nominal/off-nominal routes); providing authorization, discovery, and constraint submission services; and receiving and storing data.As depicted in the System Architecture (Figure 1), these systems were primarily developed by the ATM-X / UAM SP, and the NC Sub-Project / ATI teams.The DSS was developed by industry and hosted by one of the airspace partners.The second category of requirements were capabilities the NC-DT airspace partners needed in order to connect to the simulated airspace services and exercise the capabilities necessary for the scenarios.This included a PSU that interfaced with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform so that operations could be planned and re-planned and enabled simulated vehicles to fly the planned operations.These capabilities, while not strictly necessary to meet the success criteria of X3, were beneficial because they supported data collection, and could be used for the development and refinement of the requirements for future NC simulations and flights tests.
ScenariosThree simulated scenarios were tested in X3 as part of a joint effort between NASA, the FAA, and airspace partners.All industry partners in X3 were encouraged to execute any or all of the NC Scenarios 1 through 3 out of the 7 total NC Scenarios.The UAM SP maintained flexibility to enable data collection and validation of NC scenarios for partners that were ready to test.General assumptions which apply to all scenarios are described in Table 3.
Simulation EnvironmentOnly one airspace partner will run the scenario at any given time in X3.Scenarios were designed such that complexity increased in each scenario.Adaptation files in KML format were provided to the airspace partners for each scenario and included details such as airspace classes, nominal routes, and off-nominal routes.
Scenario 1 DescriptionScenario 1 included flight and operation planning for nominal operations.Additional assumptions specific to Scenario 1 are included in Table 4.
Air traffic control (ATC) CommunicationsCurrent day (verbal) communications not required.Adaptation UAM airspace/routes are pre-defined and shared with partners as adaptation (files), including terrain elevation data along the route.The airspace objectives for Scenario 1 were to demonstrate a PSU's ability to perform predeparture flight planning for UAM aircraft, including scheduled departure and arrival times and strategic deconfliction.In Scenario 1, the PSUs planned an operation using the provided routes and interfaced with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform to announce the operation.This was followed by a simulation of vehicle(s) which conformed to that plan.A generic representation of this scenario is shown in Figure 2. The line indicates the route, and the arrows indicate the intended direction of the aircraft.
Scenario 2 DescriptionScenario 2 included en-route operation re-planning in response to an announced airspace constraint.Additional assumptions specific to Scenario 2 are included in Table 5. Adaptation UAM airspace/routes are pre-defined and shared with partners as adaptation static files.Generic airspace with terrain data along the route and locations of Class D, E/G airspace boundaries.
ATC CommunicationsCurrent day (verbal) communications are not required.Exit of the UAM route will normally prompt UAM vehicle and ATC interaction in Class D airspace.Presume that ATC has communicated to and pre-authorized the UAM aircraft regarding the re-route around the Constraint and re-joining the corridor.
Constraint CreationWill be announced by a NASA service using the USS-USS and USS-DSS APIs.
UAM Re-routeThe UAM re-route flight path is pre-authorized by ATC and provided as updated waypoints to the PSU.In addition to the airspace objectives listed in Scenario 1, the objectives of this scenario are to demonstrate:• Interfaces for generating, and announcing airspace constraints to operations that may be impacted by the constraints both pre-departure and in flight • PSU's ability to receive airspace constraints and re-plan operations accordingly In Scenario 2, the PSUs planned the operation(s) using the provided routes, interfaced with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform to announce the operation(s), and then simulated vehicle(s), which were expected to conform to that plan.While the operation(s) were in-flight, an airspace constraint (a UAS Volume Reservation, or UVR) was announced by the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform using the defined APIs.The PSU:1. Updated the operation plan(s) using the waypoints around the constraint which were provided in the adaptation files, 2. Announced the updated plan(s) to the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform, 3. Simulated the vehicle(s) that were expected to conform to the updated operation plan(s).A generic representation of this scenario is shown in Figure 3.
Scenario 3 DescriptionIn order to develop a scalable Vertiport design and procedures, and explore influencing factors, Scenario 3 was split into three test cases: Scenarios 3A, 3B, and 3C.The influencing factors that were explored included the impacts of go-arounds and landing on an unplanned vertipad or location on the surface of the airport The overarching airspace objectives for this scenario were to demonstrate:• Vertiport operations including density of landing/takeoffs, traffic flow management, and operations at closely spaced UAM vertipads • A PSU's ability to safely and efficiently support UAM aircraft that perform a goaround with another approach/landing attempt • A PSU's ability to safely and efficiently support UAM aircraft with emergency states that require changing landing locations
Scenario 3AScenario 3A included en-route operation re-planning in response to an occupied or obstructed vertipad.Additional assumptions specific to Scenario 3A are included in Table 6.Adaptation UAM airspace/routes are pre-defined and shared with partners as adaptation (files).Generic airspace with terrain data along the route and locations of Class D, E/G airspace boundaries.
ATC CommunicationsCurrent day (verbal) communications not required.Go-Around is a published procedure that does not require ATC communication.
Element AssumptionGo-Around trigger PSU detects that the landing pad is unavailable and triggers the go-around
UAM Go-Around RouteThe UAM go-around route is a pre-defined contingency plan (similar to the loiter path) and is taken by the flight.In Scenario 3A, the PSUs planned operation(s) using the provided routes, interfaced with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform to announce the operation(s), and then simulated vehicle(s) that were expected to conform to that plan.Prior to arrival of the operation, the PSU was alerted that the intended landing location was unavailable.As a result, the PSU:1. Generated an updated operation plan to perform a go-around using the provided route, 2. Announced the updated operation plan to the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform, 3. Simulated vehicle(s) that were expected to conform to the updated operation plan.Following the go-around, the operation was expected to be re-sequenced with the other operations planned to land at the same vertiport.A generic representation of this scenario is shown in Figure 4.
Scenario 3BScenario 3B included en-route operation re-planning in response to an occupied or obstructed vertipad similar to Scenario 3A.Additional assumptions specific to Scenario 3B are included in Table 7.
Table 7 Scenario 3B Assumptions for X3
Element AssumptionAirspace Class D/E/G, Day VMC/ VFR.Adaptation UAM airspace/routes are pre-defined and shared with partners as adaptation (files).Generic airspace with terrain data along the route and locations of Class D and E/G airspace boundaries.
ATC CommunicationsCurrent day (verbal) communications not required.Landing on the same vertiport but to a different vertipad is assumed to be managed by the operators
Alternate Landing TriggerPSU detects the landing pad is unavailable and the aircraft is unable to do a go-around, requiring landing on a different pad.
Element Assumption
Alternate Landing LocationThe PSU will update its operation volume and land at the new location.The alternate vertipad is a pre-defined contingency planIn Scenario 3B, the PSUs planned operation(s) using the provided routes, interfaced with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform to announce the operation(s) plan, followed by simulation of the vehicle(s) that were expected to conform to that plan.Prior to the arrival of the operation at the intended vertipad, the PSU was alerted that the intended landing location was unavailable.The vehicle was not be able to perform a go-around (like in Scenario 3A) due to the vehicle status and needed to land at an alternate vertipad on the same vertiport.As a result, the PSU:1. Generated an updated operation plan to land at the provided alternate vertipad, 2. Announced the updated operation plan to the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform, 3. Simulated the vehicle, which was expected to conform to the updated operation plan.A generic representation of this scenario is shown in Figure 5.
Scenario 3CScenario 3C included en-route operation re-planning in response to an emergency landing request made by the UAM aircraft.Additional assumptions specific to Scenario 3C are included in Table 8.
ATC CommunicationsCurrent day (verbal) communications are not required.Emergency landing will normally prompt UAM vehicle and ATC interaction in Class D. Presume that ATC has communicated to and pre-authorized the landing and location.Emergency Landing UAM flight is unable to use the vertiports and the operator triggers the emergency landing on the airport surface (not a vertipad).Assumes that landing location was authorized by the ATC.
Element Assumption
Landing to RunwayThe PSU will update its operation volume and land at the new location.In Scenario 3C, the PSUs planned operation(s) using the provided routes, interfaced with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform to announce the operation(s), and then simulated vehicle(s) that were expected to conform to that plan.Prior to arrival of the operation at the planned landing location, the PSU was alerted that the operation needed to perform an emergency landing which required a contingency state and diversion to a runway landing location.As a result, the PSU:1. Generated an updated operation plan to land at the provided runway landing location, 2. Announced the updated operation plan to the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform, 3. Simulated the vehicle that was expected to conform to the updated operation plan.The PSU also indicated the contingency state of the operation to the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform.A generic representation of this scenario is shown in Figure 6.
Method Airspace DefinitionFor each scenario described in the Scenarios section of this document, adaptation files were used to define a common airspace for all the airspace partners.Included in the files were applicable airspace definitions, available landing / takeoff vertipads, nominal routes between the vertipads, and off-nominal routes.Airspace definitions included the applicable Class D airspace, and a portion of the Class D airspace referred to as 'UAM Airspace' in which UAM operations were allowed to occur under an assumed predefined agreement with ATC.The airspace partners were not required to plan their operation at a specific cruise altitude while in Class G airspace.Points along the routes were provided and included the World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 altitude of the terrain at that location.All adaptation data was provided to the airspace partners in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format.For each scenario test, one route was identified in the test procedure as the primary route.Operations identified as part of the test procedure were required to use this primary/nominal route as shown in Figure 8.Similarly, if there was a scripted off-nominal event, that off-nominal route was also identified in the procedure.Both the nominal and off-nominal routes were provided to exercise control over the scenarios and allow comparisons where possible among different airspace partners.The adaptation for the routes and classes of airspace created a generic airspace based on Class D airports in Dallas area.The two class D airspaces that were emulated included Arlington and Alliance airspaces.These airspaces were then transposed to Edwards Airforce Base (EDW) for terrain because the NC flight test was planned at that location.The emulation of the route planned for NC flight test was referred to as the nominal route that all airspace partners were required to fly as shown in Figure 7.
Test ApproachThe general sequence of test events for a scenario is shown in Figure 8.This sequence was used for each scenario, based on that scenario's test plan.Connectivity and validation tests were followed by functional tests that focused on required functionality for the scenarios.Lastly scenario tests were used for data collection with every partner who was ready and available to test.
Figure 8 X3 Testing Sequence Per ScenarioValidation tests were performed on individual subsystems to exercise the applicable API endpoints without connecting to other subsystems.This approach was based on the testing performed in UTM TCL-4 [8].The primary focus of the validation test was verifying the expected HTTP response that was returned when the validation criteria identified in the API failed.Only endpoints exercised by a simulated PSU were tested.The FIMS Authorization Server (FIMS-AZ) Validation Test was developed by NASA.The DSS-USS and USS-USS validation tests were developed jointly by NASA and the airspace partners.These tests included two categories: tests which required an airspace partner operation, and tests which did not.The test that could be run without an airspace partner operation were run routinely.Tests which required an active operation from the airspace partner were run during the connectivity tests at the beginning of a test session.Connectivity Tests were performed with multiple connected subsystems at the beginning of each test session to ensure that the exchanged data were as expected.In general, this was limited to posting an operation and/or constraint, and not necessarily flying a route.Once the operation/constraint was active, the additional Validation Tests were performed.If the expected data were exchanged successfully during the connectivity test, the functional tests and/or the scenario tests were performed.Functional tests were intended to be run before the scenario tests as a preliminary assessment of the capabilities needed by the scenario tests.This provided additional confidence that the scenario test would be successful and collected data would be of good quality.The functional tests also exercised capabilities that may not be specifically identified in a scenario test but may be encountered.One example of this was correctly reporting a nonconforming state, which is when an operation goes out of its planned operation volume.Following completion of the applicable functional tests, the scenario tests were performed.In some cases, all functional tests were not performed leading up to the scenario test.The reasons for not performing functional tests were resource constraints, time constraints or lack of capability.In the event of time constraints, priority was given to the scenario tests.An example of the impact of not performing a functional test prior to the scenario test is provided in the NonConforming Announcement Section of this document.
ScheduleThe X3 simulation tests started on July 30, 2020 and completed on December 11, 2020.X3 testing was intended to be as flexible as possible to allow partners with different levels of maturity and capabilities to be able to test at their own pace.To support this, partners were able to test any procedure or capability that was available up until the scheduled end date of the simulation.
Test ConfigurationsEach test scenario built on the functionality tested in the previous scenario.As a result, the configuration of the system under test evolved with the added functionality.The test configuration was documented for every test procedure that was conducted with the airspace partners.The Scenario 1 configuration included testing with the FIMS-AZ server, Discovery System, Data Collection PSU, and the Data Pipeline.The Scenario 2 configuration included the Scenario 1 configuration, and the Constraint Submitter used for submitting the temporary flight restriction.These capabilities were not included prior to the start of Scenario 1 testing, resulting in the need for additional validation, connectivity, and functional testing for Scenario 2. The Scenario 3 configuration did not add any additional subsystems.
Test SessionsAll airspace partners were allowed to reserve a test session for up to 2 hours, where they would have full access to the designated test area and could run any procedure available to them at that time.Generally, each test session began by running the Connectivity test, followed by the applicable Functional or Scenario test.Results and notes from each test were recorded for the test procedures.
Data Collection ApproachData were collected throughout the testing and stored in the Data Pipeline Database.All collected data were per the USS-USS API or the Data Collection API referenced in the Requirement Process section.For each of the functional and scenario tests, the Data Collection PSU collected all PSU-to-PSU data models identified in the ASTM API.Data received by the Data Collection PSU were then provided to the Data Pipeline where they were processed for preliminary data validation checks and organized into a database structure before being added to a PostgreSQL database for storage.Airspace partners also provided additional data models which were not included as part of the USS-USS API.These data models were directly added to the Data Pipeline using the Data API.The Data Pipeline processed the data by performing preliminary data validation checks and organizing those data into a database structure and stored the data in the same PostgreSQL database.Table 9 includes definitions of data models that were used during X3 and the API used to submit them.ConstraintOccurrence Data API Data regarding the enactment of a constraint from the perspective of PSU to operator interaction.Includes the time the PSU is alerted to the constraint, the time the operator is alerted to the constraint by the PSU, and the time the operator responds to the PSU about the constraint.
FlightRunMetadataData API Provides context for the corresponding operation.Includes metadata such as scenario ID, run number, and PSU name.OffNominalResponse Data API Data regarding messages between an operator and a PSU when an off nominal event occurs.Includes the time the operator alerts the PSU to the off nominal event, and the planned response (such as go-around, use alternate landing location, or announce contingent state), and the revised landing location as a result of the event.Operation
USS-USS APIThe information of a planned or active operation.Includes the owning PSU, the state of the operation (e.g.Activated, NonConforming, etc.), the applicable operation volumes, and the version of the operation (used to track updates to the operation volumes/states,etc).
PSUExchangeData API Performance and interoperability data for a PSU.Includes the type of request (e.g.operation, constraint, etc.) and method (e.g.Get, Post, etc.), time the request was initiated, time the request was completed, who initiated the request, and the HTTP response.This model was correlated to the operation data received to identify the times at which operations were submitted and/or modified.
VehicleTelemetry
USS-USS APIVehicle telemetry data at a given timestamp.Includes the position and velocity of the vehicle.
Model Applicable API
Description
WaypointData API A single waypoint.When these waypoints are grouped by operation ID, they provide the planned route which will be flown by the operation.Includes the phase of flight (e.g., takeoff, cruise, landing, etc.), target time, and target speed associated with the waypoint.
MetricsThe system requirements, as described in the Requirement Process section, were used in conjunction with the planned scenario test events, as described in the Scenarios section, to identify metrics.Metrics served two main purposes during X3: 1.To assess the success of a given test procedure by identifying if the events expected in the procedure occurred, and if the expected data were received.2. To analyze the Airspace Partner's ability to perform the capabilities needed by the scenarios.To support these purposes, 38 metrics were identified, and corresponding SQL queries were developed to access the data stored in the PostgreSQL database, and perform the necessary associations / transformations.Observations from a partial set of these metrics are discussed in the Results section.
ResultsThe X3 simulation started with eleven NC-DT airspace partners.Out of the 11 airspace partners, nine were able to perform testing with UAM Airspace Simulation Platform.Of those nine airspace partners, seven were able to complete Scenario 1, four of those seven partners were able to complete Scenario 2, and only two were able to complete Scenario 3, as shown in Table 10.The total number of times the scenario test was performed, and the total number of UAM operations flown in that scenario irrespective of their origin and destination was counted along with the Number of airspace partner who participated and is included in Table 10.For all the runs of the three scenario tests, metrics were calculated to help understand how the test unfolded, and how the airspace partners interpreted and interacted with the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform.The following sections describe a subset of the metrics.The metrics relied heavily on the PSUExchange data model to provide timestamps for message exchanges / events.If this model was not populated by the airspace partner, or was inaccurate, not all metrics could be calculated.To maintain anonymity, the names of the airspace partners have been removed in the following sections.For each metric, a result range observed or calculated across all test runs for all airspace partners who participated in the identified test is provided.
Airspace ConformanceConforming to airspace is an important consideration for UAM.Airspace conformance means that the operations are expected to stay within the boundaries of authorized airspace as well as operational volume.The factors that contribute to airspace conformance include the size of the operational volume and the awareness of the authorized airspace, this will have an effect on how future airspace structures like corridors are defined and disseminated.For X3, every airspace partner received the definition of the airspace via a set of adaptation files for each scenario as described in the Airspace Definition section.With this information, the airspace partners planned their own operations to conform to this airspace.
Size of Operation VolumesOperation volumes were used in UTM and continued to be used for UAM operations in X3.Design of UAM volumes is not standardized, and the airspace partners were allowed to design them based on the simulated or intended vehicle performance.The size of the volume has an impact on conformance monitoring and performance requirements for the vehicle.Generally, conformance to a larger volume is easier than conformance to a smaller volume but may impose constraints on surrounding airspace availability.Figure 9 shows three operations from three different airspace partners.The sizes for the volumes shown in Figure 9 (separated by horizontal size, vertical size, and volume duration) are shown in Table 11.Despite the differences in sizes between A (blue) and B (green) operation volumes, the corresponding PSUs supported five concurrent operations with no volume intersections with other operations along the route.This was primarily a result of the short volume durations.The C (purple) operation may have similarly been able to support multiple operations.However, the duration of C's operation volumes was 2 hours, which caused time overlaps of the volumes between operations.Figure 10 shows the size of the volumes of new operations near a vertiport location.It was observed that the size of operation volumes in some cases were large enough to encompass multiple vertipads.As seen in Figure 10, the last volumes of the operation were large enough to encompass both the 'KGKY-a' and 'KGKY-b' landing pads, which were separated by approximately 230 feet.
Figure 10 Operation Volumes Near VertipadAdditional requirements regarding volume sizes and use of the volumes by multiple vehicles operating concurrently in the same airspace is required.Additional requirements are also be needed to further define the size of an operation volume over a vertipad or an increase the spacing between vertipads.
Operations Near Class D AirspaceMetrics used to assess airspace conformance relative to the defined UAM and Class D airspace are included in Table 12.These metrics evaluated the operation volumes provided by the airspace partner via the PSU-PSU API and compared them to the airspace definitions in the adaptation files.In cases where multiple operations are compared to each other, only pairs or operations with versions that had overlapping active time ranges were used.The active time ranges were determined using the PSUExchange data, where the start of the range was the time the version was announced, and the end time was the time the next sequential version was announced.For each run of Scenario 1 and 2, a total of five operations were required on the route concurrently.Scenario 3 required a minimum of two concurrent operations.Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 required the partners to re-plan their operations and utilize the provided reroute.In general, the airspace partners were able to meet these requirements, as seen by the frequent upper range of 100% in the metric results in Table 12.It was observed that some airspace partners did not conform to the UAM airspace inside Class D as shown by lower range of 0% for metric #5 in Table 12.These operations entered the Class D airspace above the UAM airspace as shown in Figure 11.The operation volume in Figure 12 is entering the Class D airspace (green area) instead of the expected UAM Airspace (blue area).Several factors potentially contributed to this, including difficulty parsing the KML files, and not considering the separate airspace definition files that were provided in their entirety.In the future, a service that provides adaptation data to PSUs could be designed so that the operators have access to all the information in one place and updates to the adaptation are well managed.Operations submitted by airspace partners conformed to the UAM Airspace horizontally, as this conformance was factored into the design of the routes that were provided by NASA as shown by Figure 13.In this case, the route was designed to have adequate separation from the edge of the UAM Airspace to allow the operation volumes to be well separated.Separation from the edge of the UAM Airspace also needs to be considered when planning contingency operations within the UAM Airspace, such as a go-around.While the exact route into and through the UAM Airspace was provided for X3, if this is not provided in future tests, additional requirements for operation volumes within the UAM Airspace may be needed.Additional requirements for how to manage operations in UAM airspace may also be needed to ensure that they do not enter other classes of airspace.Exploration of 4D trajectories instead of volumes is also suggested especially if pre-defined routes are not designed in UAM airspace.
Submissions to DSSThe DSS enables a PSU to identify other PSUs with active operations or subscriptions in an area of interest.In order for an operation to be accepted by the DSS, the submitting PSU must prove that it is aware of the other operations in the airspace at the time the operation is submitted.This is done using an Opaque Version Number (OVN) which is assigned to the operation version when it is accepted by the DSS. Figure 13 shows a general depiction of the events around the initial submission of an operation, relative to the OVN, as they were understood for X3.This figure assumes that the PSU has no knowledge of the airspace prior to submitting the operation.Prior to submitting an operation, the PSU would query the DSS for all operations in the area (indicated by the 'POST operation_references' line), then contact the owning PSU of the returned operations (indicated by the 'GET operations' line) to obtain the applicable details, such as operation volumes and OVN.With those details, the PSU could then submit its operation to the DSS with the list of received OVNs (indicated by the 'PUT operation_references' line).If the list of OVNs matched the list held by the DSS at that time, then the DSS accepted the operation.DSS played an important role in identifying potential operational conflicts.
Overlapping Operation VolumesMetrics used to identify operation intersections are included in Table 13.These metrics compared the operation volumes provided by the airspace partner via the USS-USS API to other operations in the airspace.For X3, all operations in the airspace belonged to a single PSU in a given test run.Only operation pairs with versions that had overlapping active time ranges were compared.In these metrics, 'intersect' means that the volumes shared a portion of the same horizontal and/or vertical space at the same time.When the 'PUT operation_references' is performed, per the ASTM API [6], the operation was expected to be "deconflicted from all relevant features in the airspace."Based on that statement, NASA gave its airspace partners a requirement for operations to not intersect the 4D volumes (i.e., share the same space) of other operations.As can be seen in the results of the Table 13 metrics, some airspace partners met this requirement and had zero overlapping operation volumes.While this requirement was based on the description in the API, it was not a validation check performed by the DSS, as it was an 'expectation' that the PSU would perform this check.If an operation proved to the DSS that it was aware of the other operations in the airspace (via the provided OVN values), the operation would be accepted by this DSS implementation, regardless of the possibility that the operation intersects with other operations.This can also be seen in the results of the Table 13 metrics where some airspace partners had operations with intersecting operation volumes.These overlaps between operation volumes occurred for varying reasons.One occurrence was during a test of Scenario 2, where the airspace constraint was announced in a way that it did not impact all operations.As a result, the impacted operations replanned to reduce speed and join the route around the constraint.The last operation was not impacted by the constraint and continued to fly its original route at its original speed.The unimpacted operation proceeded to pass the impacted operations at the same altitude.In this example, the operation re-plans were created by the PSU, and accepted by the DSS under the expectation that they were deconflicted, even though they were not.Similar issues regarding assumed operation deconfliction and re-plans due to airspace constraints were observed during UTM TCL-4 testing [7].Another series of occurrences was due to airspace partners having their own business logic for how to manage their operations in the systems using the defined APIs.They may have alternate means to deconflict their own operations internally, and not require non-overlapping volumes.This is allowed by the DSS, as 'deconflicted' is not fully defined, and can be interpreted multiple ways.Additional requirements regarding the definition of 'deconflicted' and right-of-way among UAM operations is needed for future testing.
Constraint ResponseOperations faced with a constraint needed to re-plan to avoid the constraint and potentially de-conflict with other operations.Metrics used to identify operation volume intersections in Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, in which a constraint was submitted, are included in Table 14.These metrics compared the operation volumes provided by the airspace partner via the USS-USS API to the announced airspace constraint.In addition to the volumes, the PSUExchange model provided by the airspace partner PSU was used to identify the time at which the operation version changes occurred as compared to the time the Constraint was announced, and the number of exchanges to both the DSS and the Data Collection PSU.If the PSUExchange model was not provided for a test run, that run was not included in the Table 14 results.Note that in Scenario 3, not all operations were expected to be impacted by the Constraint.During the Scenario 2 functional test, an airspace partner initially tried to re-plan all operations at the same time when the constraint was announced.When this happened, the first operation was accepted but the other operations were rejected by the DSS.This appeared to be because the other operation exchanges submitted to the DSS did not include the OVN for the newly accepted operation re-plan.There were several possible ways to correct this behavior.One possibility was to add a several second delay between each of the exchanges with the DSS to stagger the change to the new route.This solution will not be scalable when there are multiple PSUs operating in the airspace at the same time, as there will be less ability to coordinate the re-plans using the current architecture.When an operation is rejected due to the provided OVNs, the HTTP response from the DSS indicates that "the provided key did not prove knowledge of all current and relevant airspace Entities" [6].Using this error response, another approach would be to re-perform the operation requests to get the updated OVNs as identified earlier in this section.This approach, however, would still lead to additional race conditions, albeit with fewer operations, until all operations were eventually able to successfully re-plan.Additional requirements may be needed to handle events where multiple operations re-plan simultaneously or provide additional detail on when a re-plan due to a constraint should occur since constraints are generally announced by regulatory authorities with a lead time.
NonConforming AnnouncementMetrics used to identify vehicle non-conformance to an operation plan are included in Table 15.These metrics compared the provided vehicle position data (including the location at a timestamp) to the corresponding volumes for that operation.The vehicle position was only compared to the volumes of the operation version that was active at that time.The PSUExchange model was used to identify the time ranges for each operation version.To be within a volume, the vehicle position data needed to be both horizontally within a volume's polygon and vertically within a volume's altitude range, as well as temporally within a volume's time range.Included in the Operation model was a State property for a PSU to indicate if its vehicle is NonConforming.The scenarios expected all operations to remain conforming to their plans for the entire operation.The scenario tests did not specifically force a NonConforming state to occur, but conformance was monitored by NASA at all times during the tests.Per the API definitions, the NonConforming state was announced when the operation left its volume spatially or temporally.Data used in this analysis showed a small number of operations that inadvertently left their volumes; thus, these data were available from a limited number of partners and is anecdotal in nature.For one airspace partner, vehicle telemetry was only inside the volumes briefly at the beginning of the operation, then it was ahead of the volume for the remainder of the flight.The vehicle was identified as out of its volume as shown by metric #1 in Table 15.Even though the telemetry data were outside of the volume, the operation never reported as NonConforming as calculated by metric #2 in Table 15.As part of the functional testing leading to the scenario tests, there was a procedure to test a partner's ability to announce a NonConforming state after commanding the vehicle to leave its volumes.This capability (commanding a vehicle to leave its volume) was not specifically included as part of the scenario tests and, as a result, was not implemented and/or not tested by all partners.It is recommended that future events test the NonConforming state of the operations prior to proceeding into data collection.During a Scenario 2 test when the operation re-plan occurred, a single position message was outside of the new operation volume for several operations.In these cases, there was minimal overlap in time or volume before and after the re-plan.There was also a potential time difference between when the PSU considers its operation updated (i.e., when it was received and accepted by the DSS) to when other PSUs in the network receive / are aware of the update.Due to these factors, the position may have been within a volume from the perspective of the PSU but outside of the volume by the time the Data Collection PSU was aware of the new volumes.According to the ASTM protocols and specifications used in this test, the operation was conforming to its plan.However, there was no process available for another PSU to validate the conformance using the specification, because there were no synchronized timestamps indicating the start of a modified operation plan.Additional requirements to provide timestamps for an operation and its updates may be needed in future.In another Scenario 2 test, an airspace partner encountered an issue when their operation re-plans were rejected by the DSS.The simulated vehicles for the operations which failed to replan continued to fly the expected re-plan route, even though it wasn't accepted by the DSS, resulting in the operations becoming NonConforming.If these operations continued to fly the original route, the operations would have flown through the airspace constraint.The resolution of this issue may be related to how operations re-plan as a result of a constraint injection.
SummaryNASA's UAM SP under ATM-X project has been investigating UAM operations over the last few years.The first experiment-X1 that explored DFW operations under the current day air traffic management paradigm and found that UAM operations are not scalable due to air traffic control workload.The X2 simulation researched using UTM paradigm for UAM operations and how advanced services would be utilized for UAM operations with one industry partner.As part of X3, the UAM Sub-Project (SP) conducted initial lab simulations with NC Developmental Testing (NC-DT) airspace partners to evaluate and demonstrate their capabilities and components prior to NC flight activities.As part of this effort, the UAM SP facilitated the connection for nine NC-DT airspace partners to the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform.Out of the 11 original airspace partners, nine were able to perform testing with UAM Airspace Simulation Platform.Of those nine airspace partners, seven were able to complete Scenario 1, four of those seven were able to complete Scenario 2, and two of those four were able to complete Scenario 3. Requirements for running the three NC scenarios were provided to the airspace partners and testing spanned several months.A single airspace partner tested using the UAM Airspace Simulation Platform at any given time.All seven airspace partners were able to run at least the five concurrent operations as required by the simulations.The testing provided insights into how the operations were able to conform to the requirements of the airspace.For instance, many operations flew within the horizontal boundaries of the UAM airspace but exited the vertical boundaries and entered controlled airspace.In the real world, this would have implications for contacting ATC since the operations were in the positively controlled environment.It was also observed that there is no standardization for operation volumes design, some airspace partners created large volumes and others made them really small.The size of the volume has an effect on the conformance of the volumes as was also found in X2 studies [4].It is suggested that usage of 4D trajectories and standardization of volumes for the operations should be explored for future tests related to UAM operations.Another insight related to rejection of an operation re-plan by the DSS while in flight.This could lead to operations becoming 'NonConforming', especially if the re-plan was to avoid an airspace constraint.These insights have been valuable and will aid in building rigorous requirements for future tests and simulations planned for NC in pursuit of preparing the airspace partners for future flight tests.The next series of tests will focus on information exchange requirements between different UAM actors and new airspace structures like corridors for UAM operations.Figure 22Figure 2 Scenario 1 Generic Representation

		(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

Pakistan and Afghanistan being immediate states have inter-connected future with socio-economic and security prospects. Principles of Coordinated Border Management (CBM) approach have been extracted on the basis of in-depth interviews with security agencies and policymakers to understand the real time needs. The current research employs mixed method approach. Process Tracing is employed in this research to comprehend the causal mechanism behind the contemporary issue of border management system. A detailed statistical analysis of prospect outcomes has been given to validate the implication of CBM. Implication range of CBM has been discussed with positive and probably negative impacts due to its wide range of significance. This research gives an analysis of feasibility support to exercise CBM in best interest of the state and secure future of the region.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Current study was quantitative in nature. All elementary level enrolled students at government schools in the province of the Punjab made the population of the study. Multistage sampling was used to select the sample from four districts of one division (Sargodha) of the Punjab province i.e., Sargodha. A sample size i.e., n=960; students and their parents were participated in this study. Research scales i.e. Parenting Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) was adapted to analyze and measure parents’ parenting styles and an achievement test was developed to measure the academic achievement of the elementary students. After pilot testing, reliability coefficient Cronbach Alpha values for PSDQ and achievement test were 0.67 and 0.71 Data was collected and analyzed using frequencies count, percentages, mean scores and one way ANOVA. Major findings of the study were; Majority of the parents had authoritative parental style, a handsome number of parents keep connection of warmth and support with their children, show intimacy, focus on discipline, do not grant autonomy to their children, do not indulge with their children and as well as a handsome number of students were confident during their studies and study, further, found that parental style had positive relationship with academic achievement. Recommendations were made on the basis of findings and conclusion such as arrangement of Parents Teachers Meetings (PTM‘s), parents’ training, provision of incentives and facilities to motivate families might be an inclusive component of elementary education program.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

All the students from two years master (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction, descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the academic advising style provided to them.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court. Nevertheless, it has some problems. The most important among them is the identification of the witness and an assurance that he is not being prompted when his statement is recorded.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country.

So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights. General people’s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
