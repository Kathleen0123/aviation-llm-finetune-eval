IntroductionNASA is developing air traffic management tools to design safe and efficient aircraft routes while balancing emissions and environmental considerations. 1,2,3 Te design of arrival and departure routes from an airport has to balance the conflicting requirements of fuel efficiency, airport capacity utilization and community emission and noise considerations.INM (Integrated Noise Model) is a software used by the FAA for airport noise assessment and regulation.Emission and Dispersion Modeling System (EDMS) is used to assess airport air quality by modeling surface emissions and dispersion.The FAA is leading the development of the Aviation Environment Design Tool (AEDT) that integrates both INM and EDMS into an integrated tool to study the environmental consequence of aviation.These tools are suitable to generate precise noise contours.However, they are harder to use with other tools for route design optimization involving evaluation of a large number of aircraft trajectories.Development of environmentally friendly aircraft routes and operations require models of aircraft performance, emissions and noise.The Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) is widely used for aircraft performance models and the Boeing Fuel Flow Method (BFFM) is used for computing engine emissions of CO, HC, N O X , CO 2 , H 2 O and SO x .For aircraft-induced contrail modeling, both German Aerospace Center (DLR)'s Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool (CoCiP) 4 and NASA's Aviation Contrail Simulation Model (ACSM) 5 are among the early attempts to model the full life-cycle of aviation-induced linear contrails and compute the corresponding radiative forcings for global warming impact.Figure 1 shows a common flow chart to design the optimal aircraft routes to minimize total fuel consumption, emissions, and noise.There is other research related to the design of fuel optimal aircraft routes.Aircraft engine emitted carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) can be easily incorporated into the cost function because it is directly proportional to fuel consumption.Aircraft noise and its impact on residents in the vicinity of airports have been well studied. 6,7 esearch has focused on aircraft noise acoustic modeling and aircraft noise impact assessment and a few studies have focused on designing aircraft routes for airport noise impact reduction. 8However, other work attempted to minimize aviation-induced climate impact.Examples include designing trans-Atlantic routes to reduce the climate impact due to aircraft greenhouse gas emissions and contrails, 9 and evaluating ozone impact due to aviation nitrogen oxide (N O x ) emissions.Note that in Fig. 1, software such as INM and AEDT are included in the internal parts of the design loop.However, the standalone nature and restrictive format of input aircraft profiles make it difficult to integrate INM and AEDT with other optimization software.Figure 2 shows an alternative design flow chart, in which simplified environmental computation modules are first developed and then integrated into the flight simulation software.The benefits include: (1) improved computational efficiency by only reserving the core computation components for the closed-loop iterative computation; (2) access to internal components and intermediate results and acceptance of customized aircraft profiles (including airspeed and engine thrust) inputs; and (3) pre-screening candidate aircraft routes to reduce the scope of the search space.Finally, designed routes with aircraft performance data are fed into AEDT and/or INM for environment impact assessment.Aircraft performance, emission, and contrail computation modules have been developed and integrated into NASA's fast-time flight simulation software, Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET), in our previous work. 2This paper focuses on aircraft noise.The aircraft noise computation method is the standard SAE-AIR-1845 procedures used by INM and AEDT. 11In summary, a simplified noise computation tool based on SAE-AIR-1845 procedures without considering components related to terrain and atmosphere adjustments is developed in this paper.The noise computation tool is integrated with FACET or other flight simulation software for designing noise-reducing aircraft routes.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the simplified SAE-AIR-1845 noise computation method.Section III compares the results of the simplified model with those of the FAA's aviation environment software AEDT2b.Section IV provides some concluding remarks and further extension of the paper.
II. Noise Computation MethodAverage Day-and-Night Sound Level (DNL) is the most commonly used aircraft noise metric and is used for US Federal noise standards.For example, 65decibels (dB) DNL is the federal significance threshold for aircraft noise exposure (refer to the FAA Order 1050.1E).Residences that are exposed to 65dB DNL and above may qualify to receive federal assistance for noise insulation or other compensation.DNL is calculated by weighted summation of Sound Exposure Level (SEL) of individual aircraft operation over a 24-hour period.The weighting is used to account for lower background noise.The SAE-AIR-1845 noise computation method used in this study describes procedures for calculating SEL at ground locations. 11By SAE-AIR-1845 procedures, SEL resulting from an aircraft is computed by adding the base noise of the specific aircraft engine type from Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) data tables plus some adjustment terms, 12 as follows:L ae = L ae (P, d) + ADJ N F + ADJ DU R -ADJ LA + ADJ DIR(1)NPD base noise values L ae (P, d) are FAA certified which assume straight overhead flight at a constant speed of 160knots.Slant distance d is the perpendicular distance from observer to the aircraft route which consists of a sequence of linear segments.P is corrected engine net thrust.There is a set of adjustments to account for variations of the flight relative to the observer.The noise fraction adjustment (ADJ N F ) is required because the length of each flight segment is finite which is opposite to the infinite-length aircraft route assumption used when measuring NPD base noise.A noise duration adjustment term (ADJ DU R ) is used to account for aircraft speed variation.This adjustment becomes nonzero after 160knots.The noise lateral attenuation adjustment term (ADJ LA ) is applied when the observer is not directly under the aircraft route as noise would gradually decrease as the observer moves away from aircraft route.The noise ground-based directivity adjustment term (ADJ DIR ) deals with special cases when the observer is behind the aircraft during the takeoff ground roll.Figure 3 shows a flow chart describing the process of the noise computation model, named AIRNOISE.The equations for the adjustment terms in Eqn.(1) from the INM technical manual 12 are given in the appendix.An accumulated SEL for multiple aircraft route segments is calculated by:L ae,f lt = 10 log 10 E ae , E ae = Nseg i=1 10 Lae (i) 10(2)where L ae (i) is the SEL of the ith aircraft route segment calculated using Eqn.( 1) and N seg is the total number of aircraft route segments.Finally, the DNL for all aircraft activities over a 24-hour period is computed by:L dn = f lti∈day 10 L ae,f lt i 10 + f ltj ∈night 10 L ae,f lt j +10 10 -49.4(3)where daytime operation is defined from 0700 to 2200 and nighttime operation is defined from 2200 to 0700 local time.So all nighttime flight operations are penalized by 10db by the definition of DNL.Since AIRNOISE is a simplified model of INM, the system flow chart is essentially the same by comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 3-1 from the INM7.0Technical Manual. 12Differences are attributed to some other adjustment terms for the atmosphere and terrain adjustments that were not included in AIRNOISE.Those terms are generally less important compared with the terms that are considered in Eqn.(1).Equation ( 1) is only applied for exposure-based sound exposure level computation.Another commonlyused metric is maximum-based sound level, which is computed by:L asmx = L asmx (P, d) -ADJ LA + ADJ DIR(4)L asmx = max i=1,...,Nseg (L asmx (i)))(5)Comparing Eqns.( 1) and ( 4), the maximum-based sound level does not require duration adjustment and fraction adjustment.In the rest of this section, key flow chart components in Fig. 3 are discussed.First, Figure 4 displays NPD data for a few Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft with a slant range distance setting at d = 1000ft with various engine-power settings for both standard departure and arrival profiles.Some observations from Fig. 4 are: (1) There are clear separations between newer models and older models, in which NPD data for newer models are pushed toward the lower right corner of the plots (i.e.newer models generate lesser noise even with greater engine-power).This exemplifies the manufacturer's progress on engine noise reduction technology while boosting engine power; (2) Arrival aircraft have less sound exposure variation and absolute sound exposure within operating engine-power range than departure aircraft of the same model.For example, sound exposure variance is 10.3db for departure and 2.5db for arrival for the Boeing 787R.Sound exposure variance is 9.1db for departure and 1.3db for arrival for the Airbus A380.This indicates that departure aircraft sound exposure is more sensitive to engine-power.Second, it is a prerequisite to compute geometric parameters based on aircraft route segment and observer positions.Consider a simple case for illustration.Given a departure aircraft route segment of an Airbus A340-211, where aircraft performance ([Ground distance(ft) (or latitude and longitude), Altitude(ft), Speed(knots), Thrust(lb-force)]) are P 1 = [5893.2,741.9, 138.9, 25936.9]at the start point and P 2 = [6635.1, 1100.4,139.1, 25976.4]at the end point.There are 3 cases based on relative position between observer and aircraft route segment: (a) Observer is aside aircraft route segment; (b) Observer is behind aircraft route segment; and (c) Observer is ahead aircraft route segment.Figure 5 shows geometric parameters including SLR s (slant range (closest) distance to the flight segment), SLR p (slant range (closest) distance to the flight path), and β (elevation angle) as well as computed exposure-based sound level using Eqn.( 1) and maximum sound level using Eqn.(4) for each case with NPD data tables for the Airbus A340-211.Note that sound exposure level L ae is almost always greater than maximum sound level L asmx by their definitions, where maximum sound level is the maximum instantaneous sound pressure and sound exposure level is the sum of sound energy (i.e.square of sound pressure) over the duration of a noise event.
III. Simulation ResultsAn arrival route and a departure aircraft route for a Boeing 737-300 at San Francisco International Airport are simulated using the FAA's AEDT2b.Their flight profiles are exported as input to AIRNOISE.Figure 6 shows the aircraft profile outputs from AEDT2b.The noise results using AIRNOISE developed in this paper are then compared with those using AEDT2b for validation.Note that neither AEDT2b nor AIRNOISE consider surface terrain.Figures 7 shows noise results using AEDT2b and AIRNOISE at a set of predefined grid points on the ground for the single arrival and departure flight operations in Fig. 6.Noise results from AEDT2b and AIRNOISE have the similar contour shape and size.Next, Figure 8 shows the differences by subtracting the noise values grid by grid between AEDT2b and AIRNOISE for quantitative assessment.The results from AIRNOISE shows good accuracy compared with the results from AEDT2b as the differences at almost all grid points are less than 2dB (which is below the 3dB threshold that is considered to be a noticeable change to the human ear), except in the area near the runway (left areas in Fig. 8) simply because noises resulting from the aircraft ground roll and taxi are not accounted for in AIRNOISE.More specifically, the average difference is 0.67dB for the arrival profile and 1.0dB for the departure profile excluding the area mainly impacted by aircraft ground operations.Finally, a common question is whether the noise difference at any grid point between AEDT2b and INM will increase proportionally with respect to the total number of flight arrival or departure operations.It can be proved that differences of total SEL at any grid point between AIRNOISE and AEDT2b for any N ≥ 1 operations of the same flight profiles are unchanged with the proof provided in the appendix.This is important because it shows that accuracy of AIRNOISE compared with AEDT2b would not change no matter how many flight operations occur.Assume the total SEL at a grid point computed using AEDT2b is L 1,AEDT 2b for a single flight operation and L N,AEDT 2b for N ≥ 1 flight operations of the same flight profiles.Similarly, L 1,AIRN OISE represents total SEL at the same grid point for the same single flight operation computed using AIRNOISE and L N,AIRN OISE for N operations.Let dL 1 = L 1,AEDT 2b -L 1,AIRN OISE represent noise difference computed using AEDT2b and AIRNOISE.Then we want to prove dL N = dL 1 .Proof: Let L (1) represent SEL value for the 1-st single flight operation.L 1 = L (1) by definition.Then SEL value of the i-th operation of the same flight profile L (i) = L (1) = L 1 for i ≥ N where N is the total number of operations.By using Eqn.(2), the following equation can be derived: This completes the proof.

as a noise computation module for real-time aircraft noise computation.The results from AIRNOISE are compared with those from the FAA's AEDT2b for single arrival and departure flight operations and showed reasonable accuracy.The maximum difference of noise results using AEDT2b and AIRNOISE is less than 2dB and the average difference is less than 1dB, both of which are less than the 3dB threshold that is considered to be a noticeable change by the human ear.We also showed that the accuracy does not change no matter how many flight operations are considered.
