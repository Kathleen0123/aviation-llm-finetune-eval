AN ALGORITHM FOR LEVEL-AIRCRAFT CONFLICT RESOLUTIONRalph Bach, 1 Chris Farrell, 1  ).This paper presents the turn algorithm along with a procedure for turning back to a waypoint to resume the original flight plan.The measure for comparing level turns is based on minimizing the delay required for an aircraft to complete its maneuver.The paper begins with a review of the level conflict scenario, followed by conflict parameter definitions.Resolution of a level-altitude conflict with a single-aircraft turn is described, followed by a practical variant of the resolution algorithm that allows specified turns, an efficient return-to-flight plan procedure, an example, and finally, some concluding remarks.An appendix reviews the conditions for two solutions when the slower aircraft attempts the turn resolution.
II. CONFLICT SCENARIOConsider two aircraft, A and B, flying at the same flight level in a uniform wind field.The airspeeds and headings are assumed to be constant and known.The aircraft trajectories can be estimated from the flight-plan waypoints and verified by real-time tracking of aircraft position.If estimates of the wind field along each flightpath are available, then ground speeds may be calculated.It is assumed that an air-traffic system is performing periodic conflict detection, using tracking data, aircraft performance information, and flight-plan trajectory predictions.A typical conflict-detection scenario is shown in figure 2.1.The line AB is the line-of-sight (LoS) vector s 0 between the aircraft, and v A and v B are the aircraft (ground) velocity vectors.The circle centered at aircraft B has radius R M , which is the allowable minimum separation (5 nmi outside terminal airspace) to avoid conflict.In a frame moving with aircraft B, aircraft A proceeds along the relative velocity vector v R , which is defined as(2.1)To avoid conflict, the relative velocity vector must be directed along or outside the dashed lines tangent to the circle (conflict zone).If the allowable minimum separation is R M , then the required angle between v R and s 0 is where S 0 is the length of the LoS vector.Note that when S 0 R M , the aircraft are already in violation.It is clear that a potential conflict must be detected while | | < 90 in order to effect a resolution.(Angles shown as increasing clockwise (cw) are positive.)The situation shown in figure 2.1 indicates that a conflict exists, that is, the dashed line containing the relative velocity vector v R penetrates the conflict circle of radius R M (at point F).Horizontal resolution can be achieved if one or both aircraft maneuver to cause v R to rotate about point A by an angle , so that the relative velocity vector lies along either tangent line.A rotation of the velocity triangle ACP to either line will resolve the conflict; this rotation can always be accomplished by each aircraft simultaneously turning by the angle .For operational reasons, however, single-aircraft maneuvers are preferred and are considered here.A v B v R s 0 R MC D E F v A v A v B P r MClearly, no aircraft can turn instantaneously.For conflicts detected early enough (at least four minutes before minimum separation), turn dynamics should not be a concern.The addition of constantradius turns is straightforward, but is not covered here.A turn in a significant wind field will of course affect the ground speed of the turning aircraft, but winds are considered negligible in what follows.
III. CONFLICT PARAMETERSTo describe the conflict scenario of figure 2.1 quantitatively, the magnitude and heading of vector v R must be computed.Note that heading angles are measured positive cw from the vertical (North) on the page.To compute the relative velocity vector, first assign heading angles A , B and speeds V A , V B to the velocity vectors v A and v B , respectively.To obtain the speed V R and heading R of the relative velocity vector, apply the Law of Sines to the velocity triangle ACP.The result is given by(3.1)Use trigonometric identities to obtain(3.2)If the aircraft do not maneuver to avoid the conflict, their minimum separation will occur at point E (the line segments AE and DB are perpendicular).Minimum separation is represented by the segment BE.Its length and the predicted time to reach point E are given by where S 0 is the initial separation at the time of conflict prediction and V R is the relative speed.An important parameter for representing a conflict is the predicted time to reach first loss of separation (point F in figure 2.1).The distance to first loss along the relative velocity vector is the difference AE -FE, which is equivalent to(3.4)Recall that S 0 is the LoS distance between aircraft A and B at the conflict-detection instant time t 0 .Hence, the predicted time to reach first loss of separation is A parameter for specifying a resolution is the time either (or both) aircraft must fly after turning to reach a suitable turn-back point (shown as point D in fig.2.1).At this point, the maneuvering aircraft may turn back toward its original track and proceed to a downstream waypoint.The turn-back point is defined so that a heading change of the relative velocity vector of no more than -2 will avoid reentering the conflict zone.Since the line segments AE and DB are perpendicular, it can be shown that the distance between points A and D and the time to reach turnback are given by(3.6)where is the speed of the resolved relative velocity vector along AD.If the conflicting aircraft are indeed at the same flight level in cruise, the time t T in eq.(3.6) is useful for computing the turn-back point.For example, if aircraft A turns to avoid the conflict, it should turn back from its vector leg after a distanceThe next section describes an algorithm for calculating a turn required for a single aircraft A to clear a conflict.
IV. SINGLE AIRCRAFT RESOLUTIONResolution schemes that have one aircraft making a heading change have been devised (ref.[1][2][3].These schemes may be operationally preferable to providing simultaneous advisories to both aircraftv A r M v A v BThe resolved heading for the faster aircraft is obtained by applying the Law of Sines to the new velocity triangle (either ACc or ACe).The result is where is the new heading of aircraft A (either Cc or Ce), and is the heading of the resolved relative velocity vector (either segment Ac or Ae).The circle is chosen to realize a specified minimum separation (e.g., r M = 7 nmi).For an example of this resolution maneuver, suppose that From eq. (3.2) the magnitude and heading of the relative velocity vector are Since the initial positions of aircraft A and B are known, the magnitude and heading for the LoS vector between them can be computed.Suppose that the LoS vector has length S 0 = 22 nmi and heading 0 = 90 , so that = -5 .The predicted time to first loss (penetration of the R M = 5 circle), calculated using eqs.(3.5) and (3.6), is t 1 = 2.7 min.Solution of eq. ( 2.2) to achieve a desired minimum separation of r M = 7 nm yields a required = 18.6 .Conflict resolution will be achieved by turning aircraft A: Solve eq.(4.1) for either ccw or cw rotation of the vector v A (in a negligible wind field) to obtain Hence, aircraft A must turn left (behind aircraft B) by 22.5 or right (in front of B) by 32.7 to resolve the conflict.A "turn-in-front" usually requires a greater distance before the aircraft can turn back to resume its flight-plan route.For resolution by the slower aircraft, refer to figure 4.2, and again rotate vector v A about point C until the relative velocity vector lines up with either tangent line.Here it is seen that a v A rotation yields two intersections with the lower tangent line (at e 1 and e 2 ), and two intersections with the upper tangent line (at c 1 and c 2 ).In this case, there are two valid solutions for the slower aircraft with each tangent line.In some cases, however, there may be no solutions for one of the tangent lines (e.g., shorten the length of v A in fig.4.2).The limiting conditions are derived in appendix A.When two valid solutions exist for the slower aircraft along a given tangent line, the first is given by eq.(4.1); the second solution is Interchange the aircraft labels of the previous example so that A again is the turning aircraft.Now the speeds and headings areThe speed and heading of the relative velocity vector are Recall that the LoS vector has magnitude S 0 = 22 nm; its heading is now 0 = -90 ( = -5 ).The predicted time to first loss is still 2.7 min, and r M = 7 nm again requires that = 18.6 .Conflict resolution will again be achieved by turning aircraft A. However, each of the two velocityvector rotations must be checked for validity; i.e., the ccw rotation is = -13.5 , while the cw rotation is = 23.6 .From eq. (A.3), the valid range is .Hence the ccw rotation yields no solution, while there will be two solutions for the cw rotation.For = 23.6 , the solutions obtained from eqs.
V. A PRACTICAL TURN ALGORITHMIn the previous section, the turn was dependent on the specified minimum separation.That is, the value of from eq. (2.2) defined a heading for the relative velocity vector ; then the heading for the maneuvering aircraft was found using eq.(4.1) (or eqs.(4.1) and (4.2)).However, in a significant wind field, the ground speed will change along the new path, requiring either an airspeed change to maintain constant ground speed, or iteration to maintain constant airspeed.Neither alternative is explored here.A more practical approach is to first choose a set of turns for the maneuvering aircraft (e.g., 15 , 30 , etc.); for each turn calculate the relative velocity vector, and check to see if some desired minimum separation will be met.This approach is consistent with current operational practice.Furthermore, in the presence of a significant wind field, the ground speed along each of the proposed new headings can be estimated, using the (unchanged) airspeed and wind estimates.To illustrate for aircraft A, a desired turn will yield a target heading Next, compute the new ground-speed and use eq.( 3.1) to calculate the resolved relative velocity vector .The required rotation from the LoS vector and the minimum separation achieved with this turn are then Now, if | | < 90 and if r M is greater than some desired minimum separation (say 7 nmi), continue with this turn maneuver by calculating t T , the predicted time to the turn-back point from eq. (3.6) and d V , the distance along the vector leg to turn back from eq. (3.7).Note that if A is the slower aircraft, the value of obtained in this approach will always satisfy the inequality of eq.(A.4).Finally, check to ensure that .If the predicted r M is smaller than the desired minimum separation, abandon the turn trial and try a turn in the opposite direction (or go to the next larger turn, if possible).Note that if | | 90 the algorithm is not valid.However, here a simple vector turn still may result in a resolution of the conflict.In this case, choose the turn-back distance to be , where d 1 is the distance to first loss for aircraft A. Now we return to the first example of section IV, and consider a turn for aircraft A that yields a minimum separation of at least 7 nmi.For a left turn of 25°, the target heading will be The resulting velocity vector, minimum separation, and turn-back distance is Note that the velocity vector has, in fact, been rotated ccw by = 15° to provide a resolution with predicted minimum separation of 7.5 nmi.The results of the second example of section IV imply that selection of a cw turn from the set (15 , 30 , 45 , 60 ) would be limited to 60 .The other right turns would yield predicted minimum separations less than 7 nmi.For a right turn of 60°, the target heading is and the resulting velocity vector, minimum separation, and turn-back distance are
VI. MANEUVER COMPLETIONTo complete a turn maneuver, the aircraft returns to its original flightpath, preferably to a designated flight-plan waypoint.A candidate return waypoint must be within suitable limits for the range (LoS distance) from the initial point to the waypoint.The minimum range is set to twice the distance to first loss, a distance that is usually available in the conflict data record; it can also be estimated using eq.(3.4).The maximum range is set to the lesser of the range to the final fix and 500 nmi.The final fix is generally excluded from return candidacy.If no flight-plan waypoint exists within the range window, then one or more waypoints may be inserted and the one ultimately selected added to the flight-plan set.A typical level conflict resolution maneuver for a cw turn is shown in figure 6.1.A candidate return waypoint is also tested to satisfy the conditions where d R is the distance to the return waypoint from the turn-back point, d V is the distance from the initial point to turn back, and T is the turn angle between the vector leg and the return leg of the maneuver.This test is based on operational considerations.Note that if the test fails for the last waypoint candidate, the value of d V can be reduced until the test is satisfied.Following completion, a turn maneuver should be checked for conflicts with other aircraft in the airspace.If several candidate turns for resolving a conflict exist, they can be ranked using a delay metric.This metric is defined as the difference in the estimated times to the return waypoint along the resolution path and the original path.In most cases maneuvers would be evaluated in the order of increasing delay.
VII. A CASE STUDYThe level-turn algorithm described in sections V and VI was developed and tested in an environment with MATLAB software from The MathWorks, Inc.; it was then converted to Java, and implemented with the AAC auto-resolution software in the ACES air-traffic simulation (ref.This section provides a case study of one level conflict pair for which several trial plans are created.The trial plans consist of level-turn maneuvers for either aircraft, which would be created in the AAC module, and ordered so that the maneuver with the least delay from the original route would be sent to ACES to be checked for feasibility and conflicts.This study, however, was performed with MATLAB using the level resolution algorithms described in the previous sections, applied to ACES conflict data.The same algorithms, with some practical constraints, have been implemented in the AAC module.The case chosen for this paper is a conflict between flights AAL309 (an MD-80) and UAL8193 (a B757), flying at 31,000 ft through the Cleveland Center, both en route to Chicago.The data record accompanying each conflict detected by ACES and sent to the AAC module includes, for each aircraft, position, velocity, and time at the initial point, the first-loss point, the minimum separation point, and each flight-plan waypoint.Data for the initial point should be considered "measured," the rest, "predicted" by the ACES trajectory generator.A summary of the conflict data is given in table 7.1.
ACES AAC ModuleCreate trajectories from flight plans Check trajectories for conflicts  Calculations of LoS and relative velocity vectors, alpha, and prediction of minimum separation (from section III) yieldExamination of the data reveals that the aircraft have all flight-plan waypoints in common; i.e., they are "in trail," only 9.1 nmi apart at the initial point.The speeds differ by about 45 kn, and the UAL flight is predicted to overtake the AAL flight in 6.3 min (r M = 0.2 nmi) if no action is taken.Trial turn resolutions of 15 and 30 will be attempted for each aircraft.A turn of AAL will allow the faster UAL to be ahead when it passes the AAL return waypoint; however, a UAL turn may not allow the faster aircraft to be ahead when it returns to its route.Turning the slower AAL aircraft would probably be the first choice of an ATC controller.The trial-turn results are shown in table 7.2.It should be noted that the MATLAB resolution software includes a level conflict check.The interwaypoint paths are tested for separation every 5 sec for each trial plan, with a look-ahead time of 12 min.Although no turn dynamics are modeled, this check is useful for monitoring resolution performance.In the column labeled "r M (test)" it is seen that all turns appear to meet the requirement that r M 7 nmi.For the 30 turns of the faster UAL aircraft, however, the calculation of eq.(5.2) requires that | | > 90 .Hence the algorithm predictions are no longer valid.For both these turns, however, the vector maneuver is conflict-free, at least for the first 12 min.For all other turns, the minimum separation predicted by the algorithm compares closely with the test.* | | > 90 : algorithm not valid (vector turn used).The turn of 15 for the AAL aircraft, shown in the plan view of figure 7.2, allows the faster UAL aircraft to pass in front and results in the least delay (0.3 min).In the ACES-AAC implementation, this maneuver would be tried first.The next smallest delay (0.4 min) is for the turn of 15 for the UAL aircraft.While the vector leg of this maneuver is conflict-free, "stretching" the path of the faster aircraft may cause a problem near the return waypoint if both aircraft are still at cruise altitude.The largest delay (3.4 min) is required for the 30 vector turn of the faster UAL aircraft; again the aircraft will likely be in conflict near the return waypoint.Observe that both UAL vector turns require a longer path before returning to the flight plan (at the last candidate return waypoint).
VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKSThis paper has documented a simple and reliable level-turn resolution algorithm that has been included with a suite of automated resolutions in an advanced air-traffic simulation.The long-term goal of this work is to integrate the Advanced Airspace Concept with the real-time Center-TRACON Automation System (ref.6).This paper outlines the level-turn algorithm and includes a procedure to turn back to a waypoint and resume the original flight plan.The measure for comparing level turns is based on minimizing the delay required for an aircraft to complete its maneuver.OF FIGURES ............................................................................................................................. iv LIST OF TABLES ............................................................................................................................... iv I.

Much has been written about resolving level conflicts between two aircraft.Papers by Bilimoria and Paielli (refs. 1 and 2, respectively) at NASA review the literature on this topic, and present useful results.Yutaka and Erzberger (ref.3) have compiled a comprehensive exposition of level-turn conflict resolutions.This monograph extends the work of Yutaka and Erzberger to allow a selection of turns (e.g., 15 , 30 , etc.) by one of the conflicting aircraft, while preserving the useful time and distance predictions provided by the turn algorithm.This paper documents a simple and reliable level-turn algorithm included with a suite of automated resolutions for the Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES), an advanced air-traffic simulation (ref.4).The suite is part of the Advanced Airspace Concept (AAC), described by Erzberger in a recent paper (ref.5

APPENDIX AThis appendix reviews the conditions for a single-aircraft heading resolution to resolve a horizontal conflict when aircraft A maneuvers and its speed V A is less than the speed of B (V B ).In this case, it may be possible to rotate v A to obtain two intersections for a given rotation of the relative velocity vector; otherwise there will be no intersections.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services, Directorate for information Operations and Reports (0704-0188), 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1204, Arlington, VA 22202-4302.Respondents should be aware that notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if it does not display a currently valid OMB control number.A turn algorithm is described for resolving a conflict between two aircraft flying with constant velocities at the same altitude.The procedure yields the turn angle for one aircraft to achieve the required minimum-separation distance between the conflicting aircraft, as well as the point to return to its flight-plan route.A practical variant of the algorithm is described that permits a specified turn with an efficient return-to-flight plan procedure.This algorithm is part of a suite of automated resolutions in an advanced air-traffic simulation.
