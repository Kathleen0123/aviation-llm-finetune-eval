Table 1: JADEM FT4 Alerting Criteria Figure 1: Sample JADEM Omnibands GuidanceOmnibands guidance for multiple intruders is produced by forming the union of individual omnibands guidance for each intruder within the field of regard, with higher priority alerts overriding lower priorities when alerts differ between intruders for a given heading/altitude level.Additionally, the following assumptions and parameters were used in the JADEM guidance and alerting logic for FT4:1. Ownship assumed to execute turns at a constant rate of 3 deg/s 2. Ownship assumed to climb or descend at constant rate of 1000 ft/min 3. Omnibands heading guidance limited within +/-100 degrees of current ownship heading 4. Omnibands heading guidance provided with 1 degree resolution/discretization 5. Omnibands altitude guidance limited within +/-3000 feet of current ownship altitude 6. Omnibands altitude guidance provided with 100 ft altitude discretization
Well Clear Recovery GuidanceWell Clear Recovery (WCR) guidance refers to guidance that is provided to the UAS pilot to regain Well Clear from all intruders.JADEM was configured for FT4 to provide WCR guidance when no allowable ownship maneuver is predicted to remain well clear of all intruders.It should be noted that this implementation exceeds the minimum MOPS requirements (which only requires WCR guidance when a LoWC has already occurred).Figure 2 illustrates WCR guidance as implemented in JADEM for FT4; the red horizontal banding indicates no viable maneuvers are predicted to remain Well Clear, and the green WCR "wedge" indicates the advised direction and rough magnitude of horizontal maneuver that will result in regaining Well Clear in a safe and timely manner.Determination of a "safe and timely" maneuver is dictated by evaluation of a WCR cost function.
Heading Bands
Altitude BandsThe JADEM WCR cost function for FT4 considers a number of factors, but is most influenced by the proximity of the predicted Closest Point of Approach (CPA) to the accepted NMAC volume and secondarily by the desire to maintain consistent WCR guidance (changes in turn direction incur a cost penalty).Finally, vertical JADEM WCR guidance was not provided for FT4 to prevent the UAS pilot from maneuvering vertically near the collision avoidance boundary against cooperative intruders (which may degrade Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System(TCAS) II performance) and due to vertical state estimation uncertainties for intruders tracked solely by the radar (i.e.noncooperative intruders).

FT4 Objectives and Methodology for JADEM AnalysisEach of the FT4 systems under test (SUTs) was evaluated independently, and each according to objectives and analysis methodologies tailored to their specific implementation of the draft SC-228 UAS DAA MOPS requirements.This section describes the FT4 objectives, scenario development and analysis methodology developed and employed for the JADEM system under test.
SSI-ARC FT4 Objectives and Scenario GenerationA In support of these objectives, a series of encounters were scripted to address each objective.The development of each scenario required identification of: the primary high-level objective being addressed, the encounter geometry, intruder equipage, data collection requirements, encounter methodology (including pilot instructions), checks to ensure data quality, draft MOPS reference, and evaluation criteria to determine whether or not the test objectives were met.A sample scenario template resulting from this process is included as Figure 3.The SSI-ARC team subsequently coordinated with AFRC flight test personnel to refine the scenarios outlined in the templates for production of flight "test cards" providing the level of detail necessary to train ownship and intruder pilots and execute the scripted scenario on the day of the flight.In total, 72 test cards were developed and flown for FT4 JADEM analysis; a sample test card is included as Figure 4.
Analysis MethodologyThe analysis methodology was designed to address the "evaluation criteria" identified for each scenario template.As such, the following key event data were extracted from the recorded flight test data for each test card:• First Track: First recorded track for each intruder in the encounter • DAA Preventive Alert: Onset(s) of DAA Preventive alert(s) (for each new occurrence)• DAA Corrective Alert: Onset(s) of DAA Corrective alerts(s) (for each new occurrence)• DAA Warning Alert: Onset(s) of DAA Warning alerts(s) (for each new occurrence)• LoWC: Onset of each new Loss of Well Clear (may be multiple LoWCs and/or LoWC for multiple intruders) • Regain Well Clear: first time at which Well Clear is regained after a LoWC event.• Closest Point of Approach: time(s) at which minimum slant range is achieved during the encounter for each intruder • TCAS Event: Time of initial TCAS Preventive or Corrective Alert and any associated guidance (or TCAS all clear message) • Well Clear Recovery: Onset of WCR guidance and associated direction (e.g.turn right) as well as any changes to direction of guidance • Final Alert: The last recorded alert for each intruder in the encounter • Last Track: Last recorded track for each intruder in the encounter These events were logged to a database that was used in the analysis to determine if events occurred in the proper sequence (e.g.TCAS Corrective RAs were preceded by DAA corrective or warning alerts) and with appropriate timing, as dictated by each encounter's evaluation criteria.Table 2 includes the extracted events from a single FT4 JADEM encounter.In each of the aircraft state plots (Figure 5), relative state plots (Figure 6) and alerting threat data plots (Figure 7), the color of the filled-circle markers transposed on the data plot trace indicates the type of DAA alert: DAA preventive (black), DAA corrective (orange), and DAA warning (red) alerts.Additionally, the background color coding on the Omnibands data plots (refer to Figure 8) is consistent with the Omnibands coloring predicting no LoWC (green), LoWC within 25-55 s (yellow) and LoWC within the next 25 s (red) at the indicated heading/altitude.Lastly, the Omnibands data plots also indicate when WCR guidance (yellow triangle markers) and/or TCAS RAs (magenta triangle markers) are present.Omnibands data plots were used to assess DAA-TCAS interoperability.Finally, video recordings of the UAS DAA JADEM display were reviewed to provide any additional details necessary to assess the performance of the DAA system against the scenario evaluation criteria.
Results
Scenario Evaluation Criteria ComplianceThe first element of the analysis focused on evaluation of the Boolean evaluation criteria for each scenario.Eight evaluation criteria were assessed as part of this analysis (FT4 JADEM compliance with each criterion is provided in parenthesis)1.A DAA Corrective Alert is issued to the UAS Pilot (94%) 2. Ownship remains Well Clear of intruders (90%) 3. DAA Alerts are removed once clear of threat (100%) 4. DAA Alerts and Guidance are provided to the UAS Pilot following the expiration of a TCAS RA, if appropriate according to the DAA alerting thresholds (100%) 5. DAA Alerts and Guidance are removed for intruders with Corrective TCAS RA Guidance (90%) 6. Well Clear Recovery Guidance is provided when no viable maneuvers are predicted to remain well clear of all intruders (100%) 7. UAS Pilot maneuvers in response to WCR guidance and regains Well Clear (100%) 8. UAS Pilot maneuvers in response to and consistent with corrective TCAS RA guidance (100%)Data analysis demonstrated a generally high level of compliance with the evaluation test criteria, with a few notable instances of non-compliance.These non-compliances were evaluated on a caseby-case basis as follows:Failure to Provide Corrective Alert: All cases in which a DAA Corrective alert was not issued prior to higher priority alerts occurred due to the DAA Corrective and Warning Alerts having the same HMD threshold.Scenarios developed to evaluate TCAS interoperability were scripted with intruders maneuvering to intercept the course of the UAS ownship within close temporal proximity to the predicted CPA.The result of this is that the predicted modified tau of these encounters was generally below the DAA Warning Alert threshold prior to the intercept maneuver, while the predicted HMD did not meet the HMD criterion for DAA Corrective.As the intruder turned to intercept the UAS ownship, the predicted HMD rapidly decreased in value until it met the DAA Warning alert HMD threshold and a DAA Warning Alert was issued without a prior corrective alert due to the low modified tau value at the time of the maneuver.While increasing the DAA Corrective Alert HMD value in these cases would lead to the preferred alert sequencing (DAA Corrective Alert preceding DAA Warning Alert), it is unclear if such a change is necessary.Increasing the DAA Corrective Alert HMD value should be considered in the context of the tradeoff between increased DAA Corrective Alert rate and the rate of occurrence of encounters in actual operations that would otherwise lead to the undesirable alert sequence.These non-compliances are believed to be an artifact of a carefully planned test maneuver and are expected to be uncommon in actual operations; an analysis of encounters anticipated in actual operations is necessary to corroborate this expectation.Failure to Remain Well Clear: The evaluation criteria to remain well clear only applied to mitigated encounters in which pilots were instructed to follow DAA guidance.For such encounters, UAS pilots were instructed to: 1) postpone maneuvers until a DAA Warning Alert had been issued, 2) maneuver to the edge of the green guidance band in the direction of their choice (if more than one option was provided), and 3) to only maneuver once (no corrections to initial maneuver allowed).These instructions were provided with the intention of isolating JADEM performance from the pilot's ability to accommodate shortcomings in DAA system performance in remaining Well Clear (e.g. by adding his/her own excess maneuver buffers or making adjustments to the initial maneuver to counter poor JADEM trajectory predictions or guidance instabilities).Such pilot response to a DAA Corrective Alert in operational use of JADEM would be consistent with a pilot assessing the predicted LoWC, and delaying maneuvering pending further development of the encounter or until a higher priority task is completed.While delaying UAS maneuvering to avoid LoWC until a DAA Warning Alert is received should generally not lead to LoWC, such delays would result in higher rate of LoWC (acceptable rates of LoWC in this case are beyond the scope of FT4).The pilot instruction to only maneuver once for a given encounter removes the pilot's ability to react to the uncertainties of developing encounters and artificially increases the rate of LoWC; refinements to UAS maneuvers to remain Well Clear are to be expected in actual use of a DAA system.Given the pilot instructions in the use of JADEM in FT4, it is somewhat surprising that LoWCs only occurred in 2 of the 20 mitigated encounters.Both instances were the result of modest intruder accelerations: increased ground speed in one case and a slowly arcing turn toward the UAS in the second.It is likely that both LoWCs would have been avoided with earlier ownship maneuvering (in response to the initial DAA Corrective alerts) and the allowance of maneuver adjustments to account for maneuvering intruders.Failure to Remove DAA Guidance for Intruders with Corrective RA Guidance: The TCAS interoperability concept implemented for FT4 required that intruders involved in a TCAS corrective RA be removed from consideration for DAA Alerting and Guidance consideration.While this was implemented in the JADEM software, 3 instances of concurrent JADEM DAA and TCAS RA guidance were observed during FT4.Each of these instances were determined to be the result of a software issue unrelated to the interoperability concept and is considered a test artifact not indicative of system performance.
DAA Alert TimingDAA alert timing was analyzed to assess the efficacy of JADEM DAA alerts in a realistic environment, including stressing encounter geometries and surveillance sensor error.The DAA alert timing analysis was limited to unmitigated encounters to remove the influence of pilot actions on the results and because some of the metrics are referenced to initial Loss of Well Clear.  3 provides the mean transition times between alert priority levels; the results are consistent with expectations given the modified tau values for each alert level, as specified in Table 1.No firm conclusions can be drawn from the mean transition times in Table 3 due to the limited sample size and operational coverage of the FT4 encounter set.
DAA TCAS InteroperabilityAs discussed in the preceding evaluation criteria compliance section, compliance with the required elements of the DAA-TCAS interoperability concepts was largely met, with few exceptions being the result of JADEM software implementation issues.Of note, two scenarios resulted in corrective TCAS RAs while JADEM deemed the ownship Well Clear of the intruder with green banding guidance at the time of the corrective TCAS RA.Further analysis by SC-228 personnel and TCAS-II experts concluded that such "Well Clear RAs" observed in FT4 are the result of incompatibility between DAA Corrective Alert HMD threshold (0.75nm) and how HMD is used (or in this case, NOT used) to filter TCAS RAs.In these two cases, it was concluded that TCAS did not consider HMD in issuing a corrective RA due to the close proximity of the intruder and the expected error in the HMD prediction.Based on this finding and consistent observations with all systems under test in FT4, it is recommended that the MOPS Alerting requirements be refined to consider TCAS employment of the HMD filter and to mitigate its impact on alerting performance.
Mode C Intruder Guidance StabilityAnalysis of JADEM guidance stability for intruders lacking ADS-B equipment was considered a secondary priority of the data analysis.When Mode C surveillance is the only available bearing source for the DAA system, a high degree of bearing uncertainty is to be expected.Unfortunately, only three FT4 JADEM encounters included intruders with transponders but without ADS-B equipage.Further, the JADEM guidance for these encounters was based on a fusion track that included radar surveillance (i.e., has low bearing error within the radar detection range).Thus, while the observed guidance demonstrated excellent stability for these three encounters, more analysis is needed to draw any conclusions about the stability of JADEM DAA guidance for Mode C Intruders.However, it is unclear if this should be considered a priority for further investigation given the expectation that intruders will generally be within radar range prior to the prescribed alerting thresholds (i.e.bearing error is not expected to influence DAA alerting).
WCR PerformanceWhile WCR performance met the objective criteria prescribed in the scenario evaluation criteria, FT4 UAS pilot participants subjectively assessed WCR performance as lacking in a number of areas.First, WCR guidance stability was deemed poor for intruders lacking ADS-B equipage; such encounters demonstrated multiple changes in the WCR guidance direction that pilots found distracting or lacking informative value.Second, UAS pilots objected to WCR guidance that prescribed turns to headings aft of the current UAS course; such turns would require significant deviation from planned route of flight, would result in significant time in close proximity for headon encounter geometries, and often place non-cooperative intruders outside the surveillance volume.
Concluding Remarks and RecommendationsFT4 provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of a prototype UAS DAA system (NASA JADEM) across a range of encounter conditions and in a realistic flight environment including surveillance system errors.However, as with all flight tests, FT4 was a tightly controlled experiment with prior pilot knowledge of encounter geometry and intruder "escape" procedures.As such, while the performance of the UAS DAA system employed in FT4 is evaluated for the purpose of furthering MOPS development, the results must be considered in the context of FT4 and in combination with results from other UAS DAA experiments (e.g.NASA PT5 and NASA PT6, where the UAS pilots had no advance knowledge of encounters and intruder actions).However, whereas human-in-the-loop simulations use models of aircraft dynamics, surveillance sensors and atmospheric phenomena, flight test offers a glimpse at the performance of the prototype UAS DAA system under real-world conditions; it is through this lens that the performance of the prototype UAS DAA system is assessed Observations on the stability of alerts for "Mode C-only Intruders" were limited to a single scenario in FT4.As such, more data is necessary to draw firm conclusions on the acceptability of UAS DAA system performance for such intruders.The concern regarding alert instability for Mode-C-only intruders stems from the poor bearing information derived from transponder replies alone.However, given the airborne radar equipage requirement and typical radar detection range, it is unclear if such intruders represent a credible concern regarding alerting stability; bearing error should be a non-issue once the intruder is within radar detection range .Further analysis of Mode C intruder alert stability should thus consider radar detection range and the bearing performance of an integrated intruder track.Nine scenarios were conducted to assess the performance of UAS DAA Well Clear Recovery (WCR) guidance to the UAS pilot.While observations indicated effective WCR guidance for ADS-B equipped intruders, guidance was deemed largely ineffective for other intruders for a number of reasons.First, UAS pilots indicated (and data confirmed) some directional instability in WCR guidance; it is recommended that additional heuristics and/or hysteresis be included in WCR logic to prevent frequent changes in the directional WCR guidance.Second, WCR guidance occasionally included turns well beyond 90 degrees from the current course; UAS pilots found this objectionable and ineffective.It is recommended that WCR directional guidance be limited to turns of less than some reasonable bound (e.g. 90 degrees from current course).Finally, a broad set of scenario evaluation criteria were collected to assess high-level UAS DAA system performance.Compliance with scenario evaluation criteria is considered indicative of acceptable UAS DAA performance .FT4 JADEM scenario evaluation criteria compliance exceeded 90% and non-compliances were assessed to be either test artifacts or the results of a (since corrected) software coding error.While no acceptance threshold for evaluation criteria compliance was established, the observed high level of compliance provides anecdotal evidence for requirements validation of the alerting parameters , WCR guidance logic and TCAS interoperability concept implemented within JADEM for FT4.Finally, it is important to reiterate that the results presented herein are based on a limited set of scripted scenarios executed in a tightly controlled flight test environment with well-rehearsed and limiting pilot procedures for use of the system under test; the results, conclusions and recommendations included in this document provide key insights and anecdotal evidence, but represent a small fraction of the analyses necessary to fully validate the SC-228 UAS DAA MOPS requirements.Figure 2 :2Figure 2: Sample WCR Guidance

Table 3 :3DAA Alert Transition TimeAlert Transition
. DAA system performance was assessed across five categories of metrics: Alert Timing, UAS DAA-TCAS Interoperability, Mode C Intruder Alert Stability, Well Clear Recover Performance and a broad set of Scenario Evaluation Criteria.Observed alert lead times indicated acceptable UAS DAA alerting performance; mean DAA Corrective and DAA Warning alert lead times were 46 and 23 seconds respectively.Excluding encounters that included turns toward the intruder (with the explicit purpose of creating immediate TCAS RAs), the DAA Corrective Alert lead time increased to 49 s.These mean lead times are consistent with (albeit slightly below) the MOPS average alert lead times (Section 2.2.4.3.4.), and are indicative of acceptable alerting thresholds implemented within JADEM for FT4.FT4 included 29 JADEM scenarios to investigate the UAS DAA-TCAS interoperability concept.Results indicate effective interoperability across the range of test conditions with one notable exception case: the "Well Clear RA".Observed for a small number of scenarios (and across all systems under test), UAS pilots were presented with a TCAS RA while the UAS DAA system had determined the intruder to be Well Clear.It was determined that such RAs were due to suppression of the Horizontal Miss Distance (HMD) criterion test when TCAS deemed the intruder bearing information to be of insufficient quality.Because TCAS does not have a quality bearing surveillance source (e.g.ADS-B or airborne radar), such cases are to be expected, and it is recommended further analysis be conducted to determine the rate of occurrence of such RAs in the NAS and potential mitigations, if needed.
