provides background about research activities in the US and Europe to get a better understanding of the environmental impact of aviation.Section III describes the airspace simulation, fuel and emission models, contrail models, and linear climate response models and metrics.Section !V reviews contrail reduction methods, describes three contrail reducing strategies and applies the methodology to a traffic scenario consisting of flights between twelve city-pairs in the United States.Section V extends the application of the method to all US air traffic during a month.Conclusions and future work are described in Section VI.
II. BACKGROUNDThis section briefly reviews international efforts to get a better understanding of the environmental impact of aviation.National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and FAA are supporting research to reduce uncertainties in modeling atmospheric physics and chemistry and weather forecasting [8].A comprehensive update on the role of key uncertainties in estimating the impact of aviation on climate change is provided in a recent paper [9].FAA is developing AEDT with fuel and emission models for environmental concept and policy analysis [7].NASA is conducting research on vehicle concepts and enabling technologies that will reduce the impact of aviation on the environment under the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Program [10].Similar research is conducted in Europe under the Clean Sky and Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) [11] projects.Modeling and simulation to understand the impact of aviation on climate covers airspace from small regions to the entire world and intervals of time varying from seconds to several hundred years.The modeling of aircraft emissions and their interaction with each other to change the concentration levels of different gasses in the atmosphere and the resulting impact of the RF on the equilibrium of the Earth's atmosphere is complex and requires the use of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models together with three-dimensional models of carbon cycle and chemistry of other non-CO 2 greenhouse gases.These models are computationally intensive and may neither be feasible nor necessary for studies emphasizing aviation operations in the presence of uncertainties in climate modeling and that require thousands of scenarios to evaluate new procedures and technology.It is appropriate to use a hierarchy of models with different levels of accuracy subject to computational limitations and driven by the questions to be answered by the modeling process.Using precalculated atmospheric data with aircraft emission data generated by climate-chemistry models, AirClim [12], a climate evaluation tool, reduces the computational time in predicting the evolution of gas concentrations, RF, and temperature changes.Such models can be integrated with detailed airspace simulations.
III. INTEGRATED SIMULATION CAPABILITYThe key components of the simulation are described in the next subsections.
A. Air Traffic SimulationThe air traffic is simulated using Future Air Traffic Management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) [13], a national level air traffic system simulation and optimization tool.FACET has the ability to simulate current traffic scenarios using predictions of weather and atmospheric conditions and has been used to evaluate air traffic concepts using future traffic and technology scenarios.
B. Fuel and Emission ModelsFACET uses the fuel consumption model provided by Eurocontrol's Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) [14].The air traffic model provides aircraft information including aircraft type, mass, altitude and speed to compute the fuel burn.The emission models are based on a prototype version of the AEDT and were verified in collaboration with Volpe Transportation System Center by comparing emissions produced by a number of aircraft trajectories by the simulation and AEDT.Six emissions are computed including CO 2 , H 2 O, SO 2 , CO, HC and NO x .Emissions of CO 2 , H 2 O and SO 2 are modeled based on fuel consumption [15].Emissions of CO, HC and NO x are modeled through the use of the Boeing Fuel Flow Method 2 (BFFM2) [16].The emissions are determined by aircraft engine type, altitude, speed, fuel burn and the coefficients in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) emission data bank.Standard conditions for temperature and pressure are used to compare data from different experimental measurements.
C. Contrail ModelsContrails are clouds of ice particles that form when a mixture of warm engine exhaust gases and cold ambient air interact with each other under favorable atmospheric conditions.Contrails form in the regions of airspace that have ambient relative humidity with respect to water (RHw) greater than a critical value, r contr [17].Contrails can persist when the ambient air is supersaturated with ice, i.e., the environmental relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) is greater than 100% [5].In this study, the regions of airspace that have RHw greater than r contr and RHi greater than 100% are considered favorable to persistent contrail formation.The contrail model used in this paper represents the simplest models for persistent linear contrail formation.The size of linear contrails can be verified using satellite imagery [5].Linear contrails may spread to become contrail cirrus with considerable cloud cover (several kilometers in width) and depth depending on the wind and temperature conditions.The model can be extended to account for dynamical processes of advection, gravity, and diffusion and to distinguish between contrails formed during day and night with different RF values [18].Using satellite imagery and numerical models, the size of the contrail cirrus is estimated to be 10 times larger than the linear contrails in some studies [19].Both numerical models and satellite observations have difficulty distinguishing between natural cirrus and contrail cirrus.The large uncertainties in the optical thickness and coverage associated with contrail cirrus results in large uncertainties in RF associated with contrails.[20].However, the modular nature of the simulation allows for contrail models in the paper to be replaced by other more computationally intensive models, such as Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool [21] and make further enhancements to accommodate updates in the literature on modeling errors and other uncertainties associated with the atmospheric measurements.
D. Linear Climate Models and MetricsThe climate response to aviation emission and contrails can be modeled as outputs from a series of linear dynamic systems.The linear systems are generated against a background of concentration of various greenhouse gases resulting from past emissions from all sources.Linear emission models provide the incremental changes to the greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from the emission due to some or all aircraft operation.The impact of CO 2 on climate is better understood than the impact of all other greenhouse gases and contrails.The carbon cycle models describe the changes to the CO 2 concentration due to the transport and absorption of CO 2 by the land mass and various ocean layers.The RF for CO 2 emissions is made of a steadystate component and three exponentially decaying components [22].The concentration dynamics of other non-CO 2 greenhouse gases can be described by first order linear systems.Radiative Forcing due to different emissions affects the climate by changing the Earth's global average nearsurface air temperature.The temperature response/energy balance to RF can be modeled using either a first order linear model [23] or a second order linear model [24][25].Contrails occur at different regions of the earth and add non-uniform sources of energy to the atmosphere.The latest estimates indicate that contrails caused by aircraft may be causing more climate warming today than all the residual CO2 emitted by aircraft [6].The net RF for contrails includes the effect of trapping outgoing longwave radiation from the Earth and that of reflecting incoming shortwave radiation from the sun; it is measured in terms of unit of power (W) per unit area of contrails (m2).Typical values for RF range from 10 mW/m2 to 80 mW/m2 for the year 2005 [20].Contrail RF is also represented in terms of unit distance flown by the aircraft (W/km).Energy Forcing (EF) is the net energy flux induced to the atmosphere by a unit length of contrail over its lifetime.Estimates of EF given the RF forcing due to contrails are described in [26].The EF is expressed as joules/km of contrails.The results presented in this paper uses Contrail RF measured in mW/m2 and can be easily converted to EF units.The lifetime associated with different emissions and contrails varies from a few hours to several hundred years.The impact of certain gases depends on the amount and location of the emission, and the decisionmaking horizon, H in years, when the impact is estimated.These variations make it necessary to develop a common yardstick to measure the impact of various gases.Several climate metrics have been developed to assess the impact of the aviation emissions.Using linear climate response models, the Absolute Global Temperature Potential (AGTP) measures the mean surface temperature change because of different aircraft emissions and persistent contrail formations [27].Figure 1 summarizes the steps involved in the generation of AGTP.The analysis presented in this paper concentrates on the two major impacts of aviation on climate, CO 2 emissions and contrails.However, the impact of other emissions can be included in the analysis in a similar manner.AGTP provides a way to express the combined environmental cost of CO 2 emissions and contrails as a function of the fuel cost.Assuming, initially, that the RF due to contrails is independent of the location of the contrails, the near surface temperature change "# in Fig. 1 can be approximated as"# = "#CO 2 + "#Con,where "#CO 2 is the contribution to AGTP from CO 2 emissions and is equal to $ times additional CO 2 emissions in kg, "#Con is the contribution to AGTP from contrails and is equal to % times contrail formation in km.The values of $ and % depend on the linear models for RF, the specific forcing because of CO 2 , energy forcing because of contrails, energy balance model and the duration of the climate effect horizon [28].The units for "#, $ and % are degrees K, K/kg and K/km.
IV. CONTRAIL REDUCTION STRATEGIESSeveral strategies have been proposed to reduce the formation of contrails.Mannestein [29] proposed a strategy to reduce the contrail formation by only small changes to individual flight altitude.Fichter [30] showed that reducing cruise altitude could reduce the global mean annual contrail coverage.Williams [31][32] proposed strategies for contrail reduction by restricting aircraft cruise altitudes.These restrictions generally imply more fuel burn, thus more emissions, and add congestion to the already crowded airspace at lower altitudes.Three strategies to reduce the amount of contrail formation are described next.The contrail formation and computation of aircraft trajectories use forecast of wind, humidity and temperature provided by Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) [33] .RUC is an operational weather prediction system developed by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for users needing frequently updated short-range weather forecasts (e.g., the US aviation community).The horizontal resolution in RUC is 13-km.RUC data has 37 vertical isobaric pressure levels ranging between 100-1000mb in 25mb increments.The RUC produces short-range forecasts every hour.A trade-off between energy efficiency, measured as excess use over baseline fuel consumption, and climate impact, measured as the change to the AGTP between the baseline and the contrail avoidance trajectories is generated for each concept.The design of aircraft trajectories to reduce contrails involving several thousand aircraft requires a trade-off between optimality and computational requirement.The computational complexity is reduced in the CRC1 concept due to one dimension.Several algorithms based on optimal control and linear programming have been proposed to solve the two-dimensional and threedimensional problems involving CRC2 and CRC3 strategies.A practical solution is provided by solving the three-dimensional problem as a series of twodimensional problems with varying altitude.The algorithmic details of the contrail reducing trajectories used in this paper are described in [34,35].
A. Twelve City-pair ScenarioThis section applies the contrail reducing strategies to aircraft flying between 12 major city-pairs (involves 15 airports) during a day, April 12, 2010, in the continental US.The same city-pairs were used by the Federal Aviation Administration to assess the impact of implementation of Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) on aircraft-related fuel burn and emissions [36].The scenario consists of 287 flights.The baseline trajectory for each aircraft uses the speed and altitude provided by the Enhanced Traffic Management System [37] and a wind-optimal route.The aircraft flight level and air speed varies from 26,000 to 41,000 feet and from 434 to 463 knots respectively.Figure 3 shows the windoptimal trajectories for the eastbound flights at 35,000 feet at 6 a.m. EDT on April 12. Blue polygons depict the areas favorable to persistent contrails formation.The figure indicates that a flight going from Los Angeles (LAX) to New York (JFK) may go through regions of contrail activity while a flight from Houston (IAH) to New York (JFK) may not be affected by contrail activity.The CRC1 concept varies the baseline altitude of the aircraft up or down by 4,000 feet.Each variation in the altitude results in fuel consumption different from the baseline.The selection of the altitude in CRC1 is limited to one change per Center as the aircraft traverses through different Centers in the airspace.The altitude changes are also limited not to exceed the airspace capacity of the sectors and maximum cruise altitude for each aircraft.Considering the relative environmental impact of emissions and contrails, the aircraft altitudes are modified only if the contrail reduction benefits exceed the environmental impact of additional emissions.The strategy uses a user-defined trade-off factor ! to determine whether the strategy should apply to an aircraft.It can be interpreted as the equivalent emissions in kg that the user is willing to trade-off for travel through areas of contrail formation in minutes.In general, higher value of ! would result in more contrail reduction and extra CO2 emissions [35].The data from individual aircraft can be converted into actual amount of fuel consumed by various flights and then can be aggregated to produce a simplified total consumption versus total minutes through the contrail regions for all the flights between the 12 city-pairs.Fig. 4 shows the variation between fuel consumption and contrail formation time for the CRC1 concept.The symbol X in Fig. 4 denotes the amount of fuel consumption (in million kg) and contrail formation time (in minutes) associated with the baseline operation.The CRC1 concept reduces the contrail formation time from 5,885 minutes to 2,572 minutes, indicated by C in Fig. 4, for an extra fuel consumption of 20,000 kg over the consumption for wind-optimal routes.This corresponds to the maximum amount of contrail reduction achievable by the CRC1 concept without any restriction on fuel usage.The slope of the contrail formation with fuel consumption trade-off curve measures the reduction in contrail time for unit fuel usage and can be used as a measure of the efficiency of the contrail reduction concept.The average slope between X and C is 0.166 minutes/kg.The optimal lateral contrail reducing trajectories in CRC2 are generated by applying a penalty for aircraft trajectories going through contrails using the filed aircraft speed and altitude.The trade-off between fuel consumption and contrail reduction is achieved by generating a group of 21 optimal aircraft trajectories at the filed flight level by increasing the penalty value from 0 to 2 with increments equal to 0.1.The optimal aircraft trajectories are generated for each flight using hourly updated weather data from RUC.The variation between fuel consumption and contrail formation time for the CRC2 concept is shown by the curve XB in Fig. 4. The CRC2 concept reduces the contrail formation time from 5885 minutes to 2995 minutes (B in Fig. 4) for an extra fuel consumption of 90,000 kg over the consumption for wind-optimal routes.The average slope between X and B is 0.032 minutes/kg.Comparing the average slopes shows that the CRC2 concept is less energy efficient than the CRC1 concept.The cruise altitude of most commercial aircraft varies between 29,000 feet to 41,000 feet.Eastbound aircraft fly odd thousands of feet while westbound traffic fly even thousands of feet.The flight levels are separated by 2000 feet between two levels of flight in the same direction.As the choice of the cruise altitude varies over a small range, the optimal contrail reducing aircraft trajectories in CRC3 are computed by repeatedly solving the CRC2 problem.Five flight levels are considered for each direction of air traffic for each city pair.The cruising true airspeed is based on the BADA data.The fuel consumption for each aircraft trajectory is calculated using BADA formulas given the aircraft type with nominal weight.In each group, the additional fuel consumption of each optimal trajectory is obtained by comparing its fuel burned to that of its wind-optimal trajectory.The persistent contrails formation time associated with each trajectory is also recorded.Curve XDLM in Fig. 4 shows trade-off between fuel consumption and contrail formation time for the CRC3 concept.For the current scenario, as indicated by D, initially the CRC3 concept reduces both contrail formation time and fuel consumption.The contrail formation time is reduced to 2510 minutes while fuel usage is reduced by 21,000 kg.This may not happen in other scenarios and suggests that the aircraft may not be flying at their optimal cruise altitudes in the baseline scenario.Subsequent reductions to the contrail formation time are accompanied by increased fuel usage.The contrail formation time can be reduced to 1470 minutes, indicated by L, and 584 minutes, indicated by M, by using 20,000 kg and 131,000 kg of fuel respectively.The CRC3 concept performs better than the CRC2 concept as it reduces the contrail minutes by an additional 1102 minutes for the same extra fuel usage of 20,000 kg.However, the efficiency of the CRC3 concept reduces between points L and M as the   As discussed earlier in the paper, the fuel consumption and contrail formation times can be converted into their equivalent AGTP values.Figure 5 shows AGTP, for H=25 years and a RF value of 30mW/m 2 for contrails, as a function of the amount of fuel used for the three different contrail reduction strategies.The figure shows the AGTP due to CO 2 , contrails and the total contribution from both sources.The contribution to AGTP from CO 2 emissions increases linearly with fuel consumption and the contribution due to contrails is nonlinear.The cumulative AGTP curve decreases initially with reduction in contribution from contrails and is eventually offset by the increase in contribution from CO 2 emissions.The curves show that even if the cost of fuel is not taken into consideration, under certain conditions, reducing contrails beyond a certain level may neither be economical nor good environmental policy.A second measure of the efficiency of contrail reduction strategies can be defined in terms of the average slope, E, of the variation of AGTP with respect to fuel consumption.The measure E includes the effectiveness of the concept in reducing the major contributors to the climate impact of aviation.The AGTP curves confirm that the CRC3 concept is more energy efficient than the other two strategies as measured by the reduction in AGTP for extra amount of fuel consumption.The CRC1 concept produces contrail reduction close to CRC3 concept.It is computationally efficient, can handle additional airspace constraints, and the next section extends the CRC1 concept to all aircraft flying in the continental US airspace.
V. US AIRSPACE ANALYSISThis analysis uses traffic simulated using all the aircraft flying in the US National Airspace System (NAS) on April 12, 2010.The flights can be classified based on the distance between the arrival and departure airports.They are Short (< 500 miles), Medium (500-1000 miles), Long (1000-1500 miles), and Transcontinental flights (>1500 miles).Table 1 summarizes the contrail activity associated with different flight classes.Table 1 indicates that although short flights account for approximately half the total number of flights, they contribute only 7.6% of the total contrail activity.This can be explained by comparing the cruise altitudes of short flights with the altitudes of the contrail formation airspace.Figure 6 shows a box and whisker plot of the distribution of the altitudes of the different classes of aircraft flying in the NAS, in blue color, and the altitude distribution of the contrails favorable regions in dotted green color.X.The wind-optimal routes travel through contrail formation region for 2,875 hours.The CRC1 concept is applied while maintaining the baseline routing and enforcing the airspace capacity and aircraft maximum cruise speed constraint.As the trade-off factor ! is varied from 0 to it's maximum value, the contrail formation time reduces by 1,960 hours, while increasing the fuel consumption by 991 Mg.The contribution to the maximum total contrail reduction is 9.6%, 33.3%, 20.8% and 36.3% for short, medium, long and transcontinental flights respectively.The short flights play a less significant role both in the creation and the reduction of contrails compared to other category of flights.Figure 8 converts the trade-off curve in Figure 7 to a trade-off curve between changes to the AGTP and fuel consumption.The slope of the curve in Figure 8, reduction in AGTP per unit fuel consumption (K/Mg), expresses the energy efficiency associated with the contrail reduction method.The efficiency of the method is significant in the beginning and is small, or may even be negative, after an additional fuel usage of 550 Mg.Around this extra fuel consumption, environmental benefit due to reduction in contrail formation is beginning to be outweighed by the increase in CO 2 emissions.The variation of AGTP with excess fuel provides a metric to examine whether the benefits of further reduction in aviation climate impact is outweighed by additional fuel costs.The performance of the contrail reduction concept is affected by the daily variation in the atmospheric conditions.This variation was studied by repeating the analysis for the entire month of April 2010.The baseline fuel consumption and the amount of contrails produced vary with each day depending on the traffic and the atmospheric conditions.The amount of contrail formation varies from 3,000 hours to 300 hours and the baseline fuel usage varies from 48,000 Mg to 38,000 Mg.The days during the month can be divided into high contrail, medium contrail and low contrail days depending on the amount of contrail formation.Figure 9 shows a plot of the reduction in the amount of contrails versus the amount of extra fuel used to achieve the reduction.The trade-off curves for the high contrail days are indicated by pink marks, the medium contrail days by green marks, and the low contrail days by blue marks.The curves indicate that the amount of contrail reduction achieved for the same amount of fuel spent over the baseline is generally highest on high contrail days, followed by medium contrails days.The contrail reduction method is not as effective on low contrail days.The trade-off curves between AGTP and excess fuel consumed is shown in Figure 10.The AGTP curves confirm the earlier observation that the reduction in aviation climate impact, measured as decrease in AGTP from the baseline per additional fuel usage is more effective on days with more contrails.Also the rate of AGTP reduction reduces as more fuel is used.Based on the simulation results described earlier, the following observations can be made about the characteristics of the contrail reduction concept as applied to NAS-wide traffic.It is not energy efficient to apply CRC1 to short flights.The most energy efficient contrail reduction is achieved by changing the flight altitudes of aircraft with ranges greater than 500 miles on medium and high contrail days.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKSThis paper presented an airtraffic simulation with simplified climate response models to evaluate the energy efficiency of three contrail reduction strategies based on a 25 years decision horizon and a constant radiative forcing for contrails.The method was applied to the simulation of air traffic data for a month in the continental US.Initial results demonstrate that a contrail reduction policy involving altitude changes to aircraft flying distances greater than 500 miles applied on days with high contrail activity is more energy efficient than applying altitude changes to avoid contrails to all aircraft on all days.These results need to be evaluated further with a range of values covering uncertainties in contrail formation and RF associated with contrails.The analysis can be repeated using more detailed models of contrails formation and with spatially and temporally varying RF for contrails [38].The results can be expanded to include other non-CO 2 emissions [39].The optimization results from this research can be used as inputs to global climate modeling tools like the FAA's Aviation environmental Portfolio Management Tool for Impacts [40].Consider a flight going from airport A to airport B as shown in Figure 2. The planned or baseline route is shown in the bottom figure and the vertical profile is shown in the top part of the figure.The contrail susceptible airspace is shown as blue areas.The vertical extent of the contrails is shown in the top figure.The nominal aircraft trajectory passes through the predicted contrail region.The one-dimensional contrail reduction concept (CRC1) varies only the altitude of the aircraft, dotted lines in the top figure, to reduce the amount of contrails.No changes are made to the horizontal route of the aircraft.The two-dimensional contrail reduction concept (CRC2) maintains the baseline speed and altitude while varying the route of the aircraft by lateral maneuvers, dotted lines in the bottom figure, to reduce the amount of contrails.The three-dimensional contrail reduction concept (CRC3) varies both the altitude and
