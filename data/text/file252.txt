I. IntroductionONVECTIVE weather is a leading cause of delay in the National Airspace System (NAS).Airline flight dispatchers file their flight plans 30 to 45 minutes prior to departure.This is typically not a problem in clear weather operations; however, this advance filing of flight plans limits the flight dispatcher's ability to adapt to dynamic weather conditions.Moreover, the convective weather the dispatcher is planning to avoid may occur hours after the flight plan is filed, when weather forecasting uncertainty is high.Consequently, flight plans are often filed conservatively (i.e., inefficiently) to avoid areas of forecasted weather.As the flight approaches the area of the originally forecasted weather, the actual weather may have moved or dissipated, rendering the original weather-avoiding flight plan obsolete.Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) is a trajectory-based, real-time planning tool that continually analyzes aircraft trajectories in en-route airspace in order to find more efficient routes around convective weather. 1 NASA and American Airlines (AA) have been conducting an operational trial of a DWR system prototype since July 17, 2012. 2 The AA trial has been limited to Fort Worth Center (ZFW) traffic only.During the trial, AA air traffic control (ATC) coordinators and dispatchers evaluate the acceptability of reroute advisories proposed by the DWR system.A DWR advisory is deemed acceptable to AA if the person doing the evaluation considered requesting the reroute from air traffic control.Although the current operational trial of DWR only involves one airline, DWR was conceived as a system to facilitate identification and coordination of time-saving reroutes between multiple airlines and an en-route Center's traffic management unit (TMU).To date, the DWR system has only been field tested by airline ATC coordinators and dispatchers.This paper describes a human-in-the-loop simulation conducted at the NASA Ames Research Center with recently-retired traffic management coordinators (TMCs).The objective of this evaluation was to assess the operational feasibility and coordination requirements of DWR reroutes, rated acceptable to AA, from a traffic management coordinator perspective.This assessment could then be used to improve DWR reroute advisory logic in order to facilitate the air traffic control acceptance of DWR reroutes.
II. Experiment DesignIn order to facilitate this TMC evaluation, changes were made to the DWR system fielded in the American Airlines operational trial.However, the test scenarios used in this experiment were derived from actual DWR advisories evaluated by American Airlines.The AA field trial system at the time was limited to Fort Worth Center traffic only.During the preparation for the AA field trial, feedback from both FAA and AA personnel suggested that the display of adjacent Center traffic would provide better awareness of downstream traffic, such as arrival streams, that may influence their rerouting decisions.Consequently, for this evaluation the DWR system displayed traffic not only in Fort Worth Center, but in all the adjacent Centers as well.The Centers adjacent to ZFW are Houston (ZHU), Memphis (ZME), Kansas City (ZKC), and Albuquerque (ZAB).Detailed descriptions of the evaluation participants, system architecture, and test procedures are described in the sections to follow.

A. ParticipantsTwo teams of three subject matter experts (SME) participated in this evaluation.The participants were recently retired Traffic Management Coordinators (TMC) and Area Supervisors from Fort Worth Center.Each team evaluated the scenarios (described in Section II.C) once.Team 1 participated from February 26 -28, 2013 and consisted of one Area Supervisor, one TMC, and one participant with experience at both positions.Team 2 participated from March 5 -7, 2013 and consisted of two Area Supervisors and one TMC.In today's operations, both positions play a role in aircraft rerouting, so having representatives from both positions provided a more well-rounded evaluation.Although there were two types of SMEs taking part in these evaluations, for the remainder of this paper they will all be referred to generically as Traffic Management Coordinators, or TMCs.
B. System ArchitectureThe basic DWR system is described in Ref. 1 and typically consists of two user displays: one is configured for an airline system operation center (SOC) and the other for an FAA traffic management unit (TMU).The primary difference between the two is that the latter shows DWR advisories for all airlines.In order to conduct the evaluation with three test participants independently and simultaneously, three instances of the TMU display were required.For these scenarios, the three TMU displays were connected to a single SOC display.This allowed the DWR reroute request to be sent to and evaluated by all three test participants simultaneously.Reroute request were sent to each TMU display through a prototype automated coordination system.Coordination of reroutes between the SOC and TMU in today's operations typically takes place over the telephone.The automated coordination system combined with the DWR trial planning capability allowed the users to receive and display the specific reroute request electronically.An example of this coordination system involving a SOC-initiated reroute request is described below.Once the SOC user completes the trial planning of the desired reroute (i.e., DWR), the process of coordinating the reroute request with the TMU starts when the user presses the Send TMU button on the trial planner (Figure 1a).The coordination status of the SOC request becomes pending (PEND) as shown on the SOC coordination status window (Figure 1b).In this case, a pending status means the SOC is awaiting approval from the TMU.At the same time, an entry appears on the TMU coordination status window indicating an approval is required (APREQ) for the reroute request (Figure 1c).The TMC can then display the specific reroute request in the TMU trial planner by clicking the corresponding TP button located in the second column on the right of the coordination status window.This trial plan display function facilitates coordination by allowing both users to visualize the same trial plan route.At this point, the TMC has the option to approve, unable, or modify the requested reroute with the trial planner (Figure 1d).In this example, the TMC approves the route as requested by pressing the Approve button, causing the coordination status to change to TMU APRVD on both the TMU and SOC coordination status windows (Figure 1e and1f, respectively).Similarly, pressing the Unable button would change the coordination status to TMU UNABLE on both displays.In this system, an approve or unable status brings the coordination process for the given reroute to an end.If the reroute request were to be modified by the TMC with the trial planner, the Send SOC button, shown inactive in Figure 1d, would become active, thus allowing the TMC to send the modified route to the SOC for approval.The coordination process for the modified
C. Test ProceduresThe test procedures were designed to obtain immediate feedback from the TMCs following their evaluation of each scenario.The set of scenarios were made up of thirty-nine actual DWR routes that were rated acceptable by American Airlines during the early part of the field trial (July 31 -September 29, 2012).During the AA trial, whenever a user rated a DWR as acceptable by pressing the Approve button on the trial planner, a screenshot of the actual route and traffic conditions on the display at the time was archived.The archived screenshots used in this study are presented in the Appendix.Referred to as the route evaluation scenarios, each AA-accepted DWR was evaluated individually by each of the six participants.Once the participants received a specific DWR request, they used the DWR tool to evaluate the request and indicate whether they would accept, modify, or reject it.Depending on each of their responses, the participant would then receive a corresponding questionnaire immediately after.These questionnaires are shown in Figures 234.Upon completion of the questionnaire for the specific route request, there was a group discussion to compare their evaluation results.This questionnaire/group discussion procedure was repeated for each of the thirty-nine route evaluation scenarios.The Accept questionnaire shown in Figure 2 was presented when the requested route was accepted without modification.The Accept questions were primarily focused on understanding what coordination, if any, the TMU expected would be necessary in order to implement the requested reroute.Accept question (1), "Does the airline need to coordinate with TMU?" refers to coordination between the airline's operation center (i.e., ATC coordinator, dispatcher, or similar personnel) and the Center TMU.If airline-TMU coordination was deemed unnecessary, then it was assumed the pilot could request the reroute directly from the sector controller.Accept question (2), "What ATC coordination is needed?"addresses the coordination that occurs between the TMU and other ATC entities.Sector/intra-Center coordination refers to the coordination typically facilitated by the area supervisor between sector controllers in which deviations from the nominal traffic flow are coordinated, e.g., a rerouted departure that takes the flight through an arrival sector.As with intra-Center traffic, there is a nominal traffic flow between Centers.The adjacent Center coordination refers to the coordination that may occur between Centers when a reroute deviates from the norm.Downstream Center coordination would probably be needed if a particular reroute deviated from a more strategic traffic flow management plan such as a reroute Traffic Management Initiative (TMI), e.g., a playbook route.Such a reroute TMI may have been put in place by the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) to manage primarily the traffic downstream of ZFW (e.g., arrivals into Chicago O'Hare International Airport, ORD).In this situation, a reroute issued by ZFW could impact the strategic traffic management plan in place for the downstream Centers and, therefore, the reroute would need to be coordinated with them.The Modify questionnaire (Figure 3) was presented if a requested reroute was modified before being accepted.In addition to the coordination questions also found on the Accept questionnaire, the Modify questionnaire included a question regarding the reason(s) the original reroute request was modified.With the exception of "interferes with arrival stream," most reasons listed are self-explanatory.Center airspace is designed such that arrival traffic are segregated into their own sectors so that the controller may descend and sequence them with minimal interference from other traffic (in this case, a rerouted aircraft).The questionnaire for rejected requests did not have questions pertaining to coordination (Figure 4).It was focused on determining the reasons why a particular reroute request was rejected and what could have been changed to make the request acceptable.
III. ResultsThe route evaluation results give insight into the potential benefits and ATC constraints associated with the use of the DWR tool during field trials with American Airlines, albeit limited to the Fort Worth Center airspace.Thirty-nine actual DWR advisories that American Airlines deemed acceptable were evaluated by the TMCs.Of the thirty-nine DWR reroute scenarios, approximately 90 percent of them were departures from DFW; the remaining four were ZFW overflights to ORD (scenarios 1, 8, 15, and 25).For reference, pictures of the requested route and traffic conditions for all scenarios as well as the associated TMC comments are documented in the Appendix.
A. Reroute AcceptanceThe acceptance count of the DWR reroutes is shown in Figure 5.In most cases, there were six responses for each scenario, corresponding to each of two teams of three TMCs.Eight scenarios were not evaluated by both teams due to time constraints; thus they have only three responses.There were a total of 210 reroute evaluation responses of which 87 (41%) were accepted as requested, 43 (21%) were modified before acceptance, and 80 (38%) were rejected.In general, TMCs did not unanimously agree on the response to a given reroute request.There were only five scenarios which received unanimous agreement, four of which were accepts and the other was a reject.These four unanimous accepts could all be characterized as returning back to normal, non-weather-impacted routing.An example of a unanimously accepted reroute (Scenario 22) is shown in Figure 6.In this example, the flight to Jacksonville originally filed a route, shown in green, that took the flight northeast to LIT before turning back to the southeast towards its destination.This route was probably filed in advance to avoid convective weather which dissipated or failed to materialize southeast of the flight.The DWR reroute shown in yellow takes the aircraft direct to MEI, shortcutting the segment to LIT.This DWR reroute is similar to a normal southeast bound, non-weather impacted, departure route.Comments The results from the questionnaires described above were used to better understand the reasons why particular DWR reroutes rated acceptable by AA users were not acceptable to Center TMCs. Figure 7 shows a summary of reasons that caused a reroute to be modified prior to acceptance.It should be noted that more than one reason could have been selected as the cause for reroute modification.The predominant reason cited for modifying a DWR reroute was interference with an arrival stream.Sixty-five percent of the modified reroutes (28 of 43) required some modification to avoid interfering with an arrival stream before they were accepted.During the post-evaluation discussions, the TMCs verbally emphasized the importance of avoiding interference with arrival streams.Improvements to the DWR logic are underway to prevent advising routes that may interfere with arrival streams.The next most common reason for modification was "Other," at approximately 30 percent.Unfortunately, not all potential reasons for modifying a reroute could be put on the questionnaire.In order to determine what these causes may be, TMC text comments (see Appendix) were analyzed.The most common theme in these text comments was related to airspace boundaries.An example of these airspace boundary related modifications is scenario 3, which momentarily clips a corner of Houston Center (ZHU) before entering Memphis Center (ZME).In this case, the TMC modified the route to avoid the ZHU boundary, thus avoiding the associated handoffs and automation issues that would have occurred if the flight were to transition through Center boundaries.Modifications were also made to avoid clipping individual sector boundaries.Another example of an airspace boundary related modification is Scenario 17, in which the TMC modified the reroute to stay within a ZFW "specialty."A Center specialty is a group of sectors that work closely together to facilitate the smooth flow of a stream of traffic.In this case, the TMC modified the reroute to stay within the ZFW Possum specialty, which handles the northwest-bound departure stream (Figure 8).Currently, the DWR algorithm does not take airspace boundaries into consideration.The third most common cause for modification was that the requested reroute was too close to weather.For these 12 percent of the cases, the TMCs used the DWR trial planner capability to modify the routes such that they would avoid the weather to their satisfaction.Since the time of this evaluation, logic has been added to the DWR algorithm to prevent reroutes from passing between narrow weather gaps.A summary of the reasons why DWR reroute requests were rejected is shown in Figure 9.The reject questionnaire had five additional reasons for the TMCs to choose from than the modify questionnaire.As with the modified reroutes, interference with arrival streams was one of major reasons for a DWR reroute to be rejected.However, the most common reason for rejecting a DWR reroute request was "request in other Center."This reason was cited for approximately 54 percent (43 of 80) of the rejected reroutes.This is a Center airspace boundary related issue in which the reroute request came at a time when the aircraft's position was too near the adjacent Center's boundary.Scenario 2 (see Appendix) is one such example: the flight was at the ZME border when the reroute request was received.The TMCs comments suggest this reroute would probably have been accepted by ZME if it had been requested from ZME or requested earlier, when the flight was further from the ZFW-ZME boundary.The proximity to the boundary does not allow enough time to coordinate and implement the reroute before the flight entered the adjacent Center's airspace.Proximity to the ZHU boundary also caused many reroutes, such as Scenario 11, (Figure 10) to be rejected.
Figure 10. Scenario 11, adjacent Center coordinationThe ZHU boundary is about 100 nmi.south of DFW.Southbound departures from DFW are often still climbing to their cruise altitude before they need to be handed off to ZHU.Perhaps just a specific characteristic of ZFW-ZHU airspace layout, the TMCs noted that rerouting these departures, especially those headed to the southeast, is often deferred to ZHU.
B. CoordinationA summary of the questionnaire results regarding the types of coordination required for each of the accepted and modified reroutes is shown in Figure 11.As described earlier, there are two general types of coordination requirements measured during this evaluation: airline-TMU and TMU-ATC.Airline-TMU coordination, refers to coordination between the airline's operations center (i.e., ATC coordinator, dispatcher, or similar personnel) and the Center TMU.Approximately 80 percent of the accepted and modified DWR reroutes required coordination between the TMU and airline before sending the reroute to the flight crew.For the remaining 20 percent of the reroute requests that did not need coordination between the airline and the TMU, the flight crew could have requested the reroute directly from the controller.Scenario 18 is an example where the majority of the TMCs said neither airline coordination nor ATC coordination was required (Figure 12).The flight in this scenario was far from the adjacent Center boundary and the requested reroute passed through the same ZFW sectors and specialty as its current route.However, it is not known whether these specific airspace configuration details are understood well enough by the airlines, and thus coordination with the TMU might be bypassed.The TMU-ATC coordination results address the coordination that occurs between the TMU and other ATC entities.Approximately 16 percent of the DWR reroutes did not require any TMU-ATC coordination ("No ATC", Figure 11).Coordination with sector controllers was the most common type of ATC coordination, involving 58 percent of the accepted or modified reroutes.For these flights, sector controllers would be notified that the rerouted flight plans would be deviating from the normal flow of traffic.Operationally, this type of coordination is more accurately described as coordination between the TMC, area supervisor, and sector controller, since TMCs do not usually talk directly with the sector controllers.Approximately 50 percent of the reroutes required coordination with an adjacent Center.Adjacent Center coordination was deemed necessary if a rerouted flight was likely to go against the normal flow of traffic of a busy sector in the adjacent Center.For reroutes such as Scenario 11, departures from DFW headed to southeastern destinations such as Orlando are normally routed south over George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) then east to their destination in order to avoid the northeast IAH arrival stream (see Figure 10).Reroutes implemented in ZFW may interfere with these arrivals and, therefore, may need to be coordinated with ZHU in order to get their concurrence.Only 10 percent of the reroutes required downstream Center coordination.However, a reroute requiring downstream Center coordination could also offer the largest potential time savings.Scenario 25, shown in Figure 13, is one such example.In this case, the downstream Center to be coordinated with is Chicago Center (ZAU).The flight in this scenario is part of a series of flights destined for ORD that were effected by a reroute TMI (i.e., a playbook route) put in place in order to avoid a line of convective weather and manage the atypical arrival flow into ORD.Coordination with ZAU was necessary because rerouting this flight could disrupt the sequencing of the ORD arrivals resulting from the TMI.
C. Flying Time SavingsThe flying time savings analysis for all scenarios is shown in Figure 14.For each scenario, two time-savings values were measured: those requested by the airline and those approved by the TMCs.The requested savings were the potential time savings of the actual routes rated acceptable by American Airlines users during the trial.The approved time savings were the mean time savings of all the routes evaluated by the TMCs (i.e., approved, modified, or rejected).When a modification or delayed approval of a route is made, the approved time savings may be less than the requested amount, since the potential time savings tends to decrease with time as the flight progresses along its current route of flight.The approved time savings for a rejected route was assumed to be zero.As an example, Scenario 25 was approved by half of the TMCs and rejected by the other half.Consequently, the mean time savings for Scenario 25 was 11.8 minutes, which was approximately half of the potential requested time savings.The total approved time savings for all scenarios was 151 minutes, or 57 percent of the total requested time savings of 264 minutes.
IV. ConclusionsA Center traffic management evaluation of actual airline-desired DWR reroutes was completed.Thirty-nine DWR reroutes from field testing rated acceptable by American Airlines air traffic coordinators and flight dispatchers were evaluated by six recently retired Fort Worth Center Traffic Management Coordinators and Area Supervisors (referred to generally as TMCs) with regard to acceptability and coordination requirements.The primary reason for modifying DWR reroute requests prior to acceptance is to avoid interference with an arrival stream.Center airspace configuration typically segregates descending arrival traffic streams into their own sectors (as they do for climbing departure flow) in order to reduce traffic complexity.Consequently, reroutes that interfere with arrivals streams may result in increased sector controller workload.Improvements to the DWR logic are underway to prevent advising routes that may interfere with arrival streams.The second most common reason for modifying a reroute request was also airspace-configuration related.Although not explicitly identified in the questionnaire, TMC comments indicated a preference to keep reroutes in sectors with similar traffic flows (i.e., specialties).Airspace configuration was also the primary reason for rejecting a reroute.In this case, proximity to the adjacent Center boundary caused TMCs in the ownership Center (i.e., ZFW) to reject the reroute as requested.The TMCs then suggested requesting the reroute once the aircraft entered the adjacent Center.The TMCs indicated that the majority of the airline reroute requests needed to be coordinated.Only 20 percent of the reroute requests did not need traffic management coordination.These particular reroutes can be generally characterized as not deviating from normal traffic flow in the airspace (e.g., departure reroutes that do not pass through arrival sectors).The TMCs preferred coordination for any reroute that deviated from the "nominal" flow of traffic.The nominal flow may be predefined by Center airspace configuration or a more strategic traffic flow such as a Traffic Management Initiative issued by the ATCSCC.This evaluation confirmed the time savings potential of DWR advisories with the TMCs accepting or modifying 62 percent of the requested reroutes for a total of 151 minutes saved.This was 57 percent of the total requested time savings of 264 minutes.Reason for unable?"the potential to oversaturate a downstream sector is too high."How could it be acceptable?"if the alerted sectors became unalerted.this is not likely to happen."9.
