Functional DesignThe  Automatic conflict detection at the ST level will initially be implemented to display only conflicts between:• any pair of aircraft "owned" by that sector controller (independent of whether the conflict resides within the controller's sector);• any "unowned" aircraft within a controller-defined distance (or time) l'rom the sector boundary and any other such unowned aircraft or any owned aircraft; or • any owned aircraft within a controller-defined distance (or time) from its next sector and any aircraft within that next sector or any aircraft within a specified distance (or time) from and due to arrive in that next sector.To include probing the effects of other aircraft, the controller can manually identify the desired aircraft to be probed.Once an unowned aircraft has been identified, it is probed until the ST determines that it can no longer impact aircraft owned by the controller.Display of potential conflicts beyond sector boundaries to all sector controllers involved will facilitate the solution of multisector conflicts.The ST can aid a sector controller to quickly create and evaluate a provisional ("what-iff') plan through the use of provisional clearance feedback, which allows the controller to determine the effect of issuing a clearance without affecting other controllers or other parts of the automation system.In addition to provisional clearance feedback, controllers are expected to use the ST to provide information for maneuver feedback.For example, a controller may absorb required delay by turning an aircraft away from its intended metering fix, while observing a countdown in remaining delay to be absorbed.After the required amount of delay has been absorbed, the controller would turn the aircraft back on a path to the metering fix.The ST also helps the controller to monitor aircraft spacing by displaying separation information at points along predicted trajectories.In-trail spacing can be shown at a defined location (e.g., at a Center or terminal airspace boundary) for selected streams of aircraft (e.g., aircraft exiting into a specified, adjacent Center or assigned to a defined meter fix All display features will ultimately be integrated into an advanced display (such as the display system replacement, or DSR), but some features may appear in early development phases on an auxiliary display interface, as shown in figure 3, where an example of controller interaction with the ST is shown.In the figure, flight UAL001 must be delayed to meet a desired crossing time (13:01) at the TOMSN metering fix while avoiding a conflict with overtlight UAL0(12.Through interacting with the ST's provisional planning tools, the controller has determined that a horizontal path stretch with turnback directly to TOMSN is a workable solution.In this case, the controller issues the path stretch clearances to UAL001 at the turnout and turnback points, followed by a descent clearance approximately 30 n. mi.prior to the TOD point.The AT-detected conflict between UALI00 and UAL200 is also shown with supporting information.The AT resolution advisory of a 20-knot indicated air speed (KIAS) reduction is shown on the fourth line of the data tag for UAL200.(Note that the Iburth line is used for illustrative purposes only.)The AT and ST advisories will be dcsigned so the controller can easily distinguish between them, possibly through colorcoding or blinking.The figure should not be considered a final display interface; significant effort will be devoted to make the interface as effective and easy to use as possible.
Integrated AT/ST ToolsThe needs of any en route traffic environment can be met through integration of the AT and ST.In a completely
Conflict Resolution ScenariosSince much of the concept relies on providing increased flexibility (e.g., routing) for users, considerable attention has been given to determining how the integrated tools will help resolve conflicts.In this section, the anticipated operation of the tools is described in some detail tot several conflict sccnarios.The expected benefits of the integrated tools in each traffic environment arc also discussed.Four typical separation conflict scenarios are identified in figure 4. Consider the numbered areas to be sectors within a Center.In the figure, the sectors are shown to be horizontally adjacent, but the scenarios also hold for vertically adjacent sectors.They even hold for adjacent sectors in different Centers, although the coordination between facilities will be more complicated.For convenicncc in the discussions that follow, all the conflicts are shown to occur in sector 2.   When an aircraft crosses a controller's awareness boundary, the ST displays infbrmation to that controller about conflicts between the aircraft and any other aircraft in the downstream sector or any aircraft that has also crossed that awareness boundary.In figure 5, aircraft A is predicted to have a conflict in the downstream sector.When aircraft A crosses the awareness boundary for the upstream controller (SC1), the ST displays the conflict information to SC 1 ; when the aircraft crosses the awareness boundary for the downstream controller (SC2), the conflict information is displayed to SC2.If the ST detects a conflict, it displays the conflict inlbrmation to SC4, even though the conflict occurs outside sector 4. Recall that the conflict is displayed to SC4 even if one or both aircraft are outside SC4's awareness boundary since the upstream controller's awareness boundary is for displaying conflicts with aircraft in scctor 2 (conflicts between aircraft owned by the same controller are always detected by the ST, independent of the sector in which the conflict exists).SC4 thcn uses the provisional planning capability of the ST to resolve the conflict and issue a clearance to the aircraft.The ST also displays the conflict to SC2 if both aircraft are within SC2's awareness boundary (i.e., the downstream controller's awareness boundary).The display of conflict intbrmation to the downstream sector allows for SC2 to request an early handoff if desired.If SC2 does not request and obtain handoffs for aircraft A and B, the resolution is pcrlbrmed by SC4 as described.In general, for conflict resolution involving more than one controller, there is a potential to lower workload through the SC/ST display logic discussed previously.For typical choke-point sectors (such as a low-altitude sector containing a feeder fix), a benefit in providing an upstream controller with an opportunity to resolve the conflict is also possible, thereby redistributing the overall workload.In addition, if an upstream solution is not desired, SC2has the option to resolve the conflict by requesting early handoffs from SC4.These workload benefits are expected to apply to many traffic situations, so the controllers will have a strong incentive to take full advantage of the integrated tools.
External Intruder ConflictFor the external intruder conflict case (fig.6(c)), assume that the AT has chosen to modify the trajectory of aircraft A in order to resolve the conflict predicted to occur in sector 2. When the ST receives the conflict resolution packet that contains the advisory for aircraft A, it checks the display logic for SC2.If SC2 is configured to accept AT resolutions, the ST probes for conflicts.Finding none (or if SC2 is accepting AT resolutions with ST conflicts),the ST displays the conflict information and resolution to SC2.If SC4 has also been configured to accept display of AT advisories, the conflict information is displayed with a message that a resolution is pending in sector 2. This message is important to alert SC4 that any clearance issued to aircraft B at this time may cause the AT resolution to be invalidated and that sector 2 should be notified if verbal negotiation is desired.SC4 will also be aware that, if SC2 rejects the advisory, the AT may resolve the conflict by modifying the trajectory for aircraft B. Again, all situational awareness is accomplished without need for voice communication between controllers.If the conflict has not already been resolved by the AT, the ST detects the conflict and displays the conflict information to SC2 and SC4 after aircraft B crosses the awareness boundary and when the conflict is within the decision-time horizon for each controller.The resolution may be performed by SC2 for aircraft A, by SC4 for aircraft B, or for both aircraft in a negotiated solution.In early implementations, the decision of who will resolve the conflict is made verbally (or procedurally) between the two affected controllers.ST provisional planning aids are expected to be used by the controllers for resolution.Display of conflict information to both controllers may also facilitate an early handoff of aircraft B to SC2 if desired.
Early implementationsof the integrated tools may require the AC to perform the role of selecting which aircraft receives the AT advisory.In this example, the AC may know that the traffic situation in sector 2 makes aircraft B more appropriate than aircraft A for receiving a resolution advisory.By placing the integrated tools in operation with functions such as this performed manually, data can be generated that will serve as a basis for a heuristics-based set of aircraft selection criteria, which could later be automated.In addition, the external intruder scenario would benefit greatly from automatic conflict resolution in the ST, which will also be developed for an advanced implementation.ST automatic resolution logic would parallel the logic of the AT; it would remove much of the need lor negotiation between controllers for scenarios that require resolutions based upon controller intent.
Intersector ConflictAgain assume that aircraft A is chosen by the AT to resolve the conflict.wishes to resolve the conflict, SC2 may ask for early handoffs of both aircraft.Because the interscctor scenario occurs when aircraft in separate sectors have a conflict predicted at a point outside either sector, it is the most complicated situation for sector controller coordination; therefore, it offers the greatest potential for increased efficiency and reduced workload.As in the external intruder scenario, large benefits are expected by using the AT to coordinate conflict resolutions that involve two or more controllers.The manual negotiations currently required for solving multisector conflicts can be reduced significantly, so controllers should have an incentive to use the tool.Early implementation of the integrated tools may require the AC to perform the coordination role tbr AT advisories.As in the previous scenario, ST automatic conflict resolution (to be implemented in an advanced development) is expected to further reduce the need for verbal controller coordination.
Development StrategyA phased development approach is proposed that focuses on obtaining benefits as early as possible, validating the concept under real-world conditions, and using operational experience to expand tool capabilities.
Phase 1In the first phase, the AT and the ST will be developed and evaluated as independent decision support aids.All integration between the AT and the ST is performed manually.A strong emphasis will be placed on development and evaluation of the core capabilities of each tool, and on validation of the fundamental concepts.In addition to laboratory development and evaluation, the tools will undergo operational evaluation in a limited area of en route airspace, involving a few representative sectors (representing both traffic environment extremes) that are chosen based on development and evaluation goals.All display interfaces will be developed only to a level that permits concept evaluation and human-factorsrelated research.The AT will provide automated detection of potential conflicts and the probabilities associated with these predictions for en route aircraft in the Center airspace.The dynamic conflict display will be used to provide this information to the AC, who may then notify the appropriate area supervisor of projected areas of high congestion through voice communication.The sector controllers will use the ST to probe for predicted spacing and conflicts between specified aircraft (manual or limited automatic conflict detection), resolve predicted conflicts through provisional planning, and support aircraft in making efficient descents.An advanced radar tracker will be used to make accurate conflict predictions up to 20 minutes in advance.Research for Phase I will concentrate on validating concept feasibility.It will be designed to answer fundamental questions regarding benefits to controllers and users.The research will also focus on defining needed operational procedures (e.g., intersector coordination) and the key elements of a mature display interface through controller evaluations.Some of the concept feasibility issues to be explored are:• the effectiveness of the dynamic conllict display in assisting the AC in managing the airspace;• the extent of the assistance the ST provides to the controller in devising and executing traffic plans, especially for managing transitioning aircraft;the appropriate sector controller decision-making time horizon for aircraft trajectories with differing traffic management constraints;whether the controller considers the benefits received from the ST to outweigh the additional workload required to interface with the tool; the expected time horizon tor AT cost-effective resolutions based on advanced radar trackcr data, and the timeliness of these resolutions in accommodating user preferences and not infringing upon controller intentions; the sensitivity of AT cost-effective resolutions to sector controller issuance timing and its effect on resolution effectiveness; and the appropriate probability threshold for display of an ST-detected conflict to a controller.
Phase 2In the second phase, most of the capabilities of the fully developed integrated tools will be achieved by allowing some of the tasks to be performed manually.The AT will provide cost-effective resolutions to the AC, who will then use experience-based judgment to determine whether to accept the solutions or modify them using provisional planning techniques.The AC will then request the AT to send the resolutions to the ST for display to the controller through a fully developed display interface.The controller will provide an input to the ST to notify the AC (through the AT display interlace) whether the advisory is accepted or rejected.The ST will provide full automatic conflict detection in addition to the tools provided in Phase I. Automatic detection should allow the controller to devote more attention to other tasks required in this phase, such as acceptance or rejection of AT advisories.Extensive human factors development is expected during this phase.A limited operational deployment could possibly be achieved after Phase 2; if so, the deployment is expected to be limited to a set of sectors chosen on the basis of benefits and cost.Phases 1 and 2 will require the use of an auxiliary display and an additional controller to be located at each sector position.To maintain all current radar controller operations, the additional controller will interact with the ST and then will transfer advisory clearances to the radar position (R-side).The display should provide a plan-view graphical interface and a keyboard lor input.In addition to the proposed Phase 2 functions, this workstation should have all capabilities currently used to perform sector controller duties, such as accepting handoffs, displaying trend vectors, and providing tools for aiding separation maintenance.Sector-certified radar controllers will probably be required to interface with the auxiliary display.The handoff position could be responsible for monitoring the additional display for sectors with heavy traffic, and the interphone or flight-data (D-side) position could assume this responsibility for sectors with light traffic.When the ST is fully developed and approved for direct use by both the R-and D-side sector controllers, its functions will be In en route environments, the integrated tool anticipates and facilitates user preferences, while providing advisory aids to help the controller solve complex traffic management problems.• An operational system can be placed in the field quickly, where it can serve as a testbed for new technology.Planned technology exploration includes trajectory negotiation with airborne flight management systems, integration with traffic schedulers such as TMA, and free-flight concepts that transfer responsibility for maintaining separation to the user.• Sector controllers will have an incentive to use the proposed system because it will improve their capability and reduce their workload.The system is not intended to be a replacement for controllers, but an aid to increase productivity.
•The design leads to a logical and systematic evolution.It will be implemented as a series of new functions that will gradually increase system capability.Manual tasks will be automated based on the semi-automatic operation of early deployments, thereby freeing controllers to give attention to more advanced tasks as the design ew)lves.
•The system is not dependent on planned hardware upgrades, such as DSR, to be successful.It will, however, take advantage of such upgrades.Although development of this system faces many challenges, no unresolvable implementation issues are anticipated.desired by the airline or pilot.Preferred aircraft operations can vary from non-ATe-preferred mutings to the use of airborne vertical navigation (VNAV) automation during descents into terminal airspace.In a system that requires positive ATe control, user preferences are facilitated (or enabled) through verbal or procedural ATC clearances.Developing decision support tools for controllers that identify user preferences and their effects on the current traffic situation would enable controllers to quickly assess the effort of incorporating user preferences into the current traffic plan.Furthermore, by designing automation to determine the minimum change to the user preference required for incorporation into the traffic plan, a large step toward free-flight benefits would he achieved.To facilitate user preference in all en route environments, a system concept based on an extension of the Center/ TRACON Automation System (CTAS) has been developed.(See ref. 4.) It consists of two integ,'atcd components.An airspace tool (AT) focuses on unconstrained en route aircraft (e.g., not transitioning to the terminal airspace), taking advantage of the unconstrained nature of their trajectories and using long-range trajectory prediction to maximize user efficiency by providing cost-effective conflict resolution advisories to sector controllers.A sector tool (ST) generates efficient
In addition to providing more advance time for traffic planning, automatic detection should enable the controller to resolve conflicts more efficiently.The increased confidence provided by automatic conflict detection may also be useful in reducing the number of conservative clearances that controllers currently issue to ensure separation when the5' are unsure of whether a conflict will occur.
the resolutions must be available to the sector controller before the conflict is within the controller's decisionmaking time horizon.Work based on current prediction accuracy suggests that these cost-effective resolutions would generate advisories approximately 10 to 14 minutes in advance of the conflict (ref.5), a time that is expected to be within the prediction horizon needed for the ST.However, reference 5 indicates that increasing trajectory prediction accuracy increases the advance time of the minimum-cost point.One prediction error source is the existing FAA radar tracking algorithm of the Center Host computer.Using an advanced radar tracking system (ref.10) is expected to improve prediction accuracy, thereby enabling minimum-cost resolutions 20 or more minutes in advance.The system is now in place for testing at the Denver ARTCC, and its accuracy is being verified through analysis of flight-test data.
Figure 4 (4Figure 4(a) shows an example of an "intrasector" conflict, the situation where both aircraft and the predicted point of conflict (i.e., initial loss of minimum separation requiremcnts) are within a single sector.This scenario should yield the most straightforward resolution since only one controllcr is involved.A somewhat more complicated scenario, an "external" conflict, is shown in figure 4(b): both aircraft are in one sector, and the point of conflict is in anothcr.Figure 4(c) shows an "external intruder" scenario: one aircraft and the predicted conflict point are in one sector, and the other aircraft is in another sector. Figure 4(d) shows an "intersector" conflict, where the two aircraft are in different sectors and the predicted conflict point is in a third sector.The latter two scenarios generally require the greatest amount of coordination between controllers.

The Federal Aviation Administration is trying to make its air traffic management system more responsive to the needs of the aviation community by exploring the concept of "free flight" for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules.A logical first step toward free flight could be made without significantly altering current air traffic control (ATe) procedures or requiring new airborne equipment by designing a ground-based system to be highly responsive to "user preference" in en route airspace while providing for an orderly transition to the terminal area.To facilitate user preference in all en route environments, a system based on an extension of the Center/TRACON Automation System (CTAS) is proposed in this document.The new system would consist of two integrated components.An airspace tool (AT)focuses on unconstrained en route aircraft (e.g., not transitioning to the terminal airspace), taking advantage of the relatively unconstrained nature of their flights and using long-range trajectory prediction to provide cost-effective conflict resolution advisories [o sector controllers.A sector tool (ST) generates efficient advisories tor all aircraft, with a focus on supporting controllers in analyzing and resolving complex, highly constrained traffic situations.When combined, the integrated AT/ST system supports user preference in any air route traffic control center sector.The system should also be useful in evaluating advanced free-flight concepts by serving as a test bed for future research.This document provides an overview of the design concept, explains its anticipated benefits, and recommends a development strategy that leads to a deployable system.
