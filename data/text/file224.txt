4,15After the three-di mension al pAth has been establis hed, the desired posftlon of the aircraft along the path as a function of time Is determi ned from conside rntlons of ajr trafflc control.General ly, more than one aircraft will be flying along the 3-D flight path or wIll be merging wIth the path at certain of Its points referre d to as merging points.ThIs Is Illustra ted In Fig, 1. AIrcraf t on the two approac h rOlltes merge in the Vicinity of the approac h gate.III the current air traffic control system the flllal approac h control ler Is respons ible for merging aircraft at thIs point.He does this by ob~el'Va tion of the aircraft on the ATC radnr and by Issuing speed and vectorin g Instruct ions to the pllots, The delays, Inaccurac Ies and other llmitatl ons of this manual control - lerpilot control loop yield a broad envelop e of aIrcraft trnjecto rles between the feeder fix and the gate, shown as the hatched area In FIg. 1.This manual techniqu e can delIver aircraft to the approac h gate with a Urne accurach of approxi mately +15 sec.It Is well known that the time control accurac y Influenc es the require d spacing on final approac h, which In turn determi nes the landing capacJty of the l'llnway.(4) Through the use of 4-D guIdanc e technIqu es the accurac y of time control can be greatly Increase d, thus providIn g a basis for achievin g higher landing rates and greater automat ion in the control of termlna l area trarHe, Instead of the control ler IssuIng vectorin g and speed comman ds to space aircraft , the all' traffic conlrol system specific s only the desired arrival times at n small number of points along the termina lllpproa ch route leaving the burden of computi ng aJrcraft contra!1nputs to achieve these times to the onuoanl system.From a knowle d~ of the 3-D path nnd the deslred nrrlvAl t!m('~ fit specWe d pOints on the path, the •I-D 1o."1!lclane e system compute s the required aJrspccd profJlc.The a1 rspeed computa tion algorith m must consIde r the' •.'Jinimu m and m<L'{imu m permiss ible aIrspeed , the aJrcraft!saccelera tion and deceler ation capabilI ty, the landing approac h speed and the effect of \vinds.Also, In speclfyI ng arrival times all' traffic control will U8C only llmlted knowled ge of alrcraft 1 s p~rfonn ance capabll!tlcB.Therefo re, the algorith m must first determi ne the feasIbili ty of tlle specIfie d arrival times by comparI ng them with the true minimu m and maximu m times the aIrcraft can achIeve W1thout dc\'latin g from the 3-D path.If the specJfle d arrival times cannot be achIeved , air traffic control must be requeste d to reaslgn arr!v:ll times or pcrmH delaying maneuv ers Buch :lS holding and/or path stretchI ng.In the precedi ng discussi on of arrIval time assIgnment, the questJon left unansw ered was JlOW air trafflc control will generate the arrival times to be assigned to each aircraft .To c1arJfy this question , consIde r an aircraft equippe d with a 4-D guidanc e system whIch has just arrivcd at one of U1C feeder fixes ill FIg. 1.It Is assumed Ulat the aircraft had previou sly been cleared to proceed toward tlle feeder fix.Those aircraft currentl y Dying between the feeder fJxes and the runway were pr~ yjollsly assigne d arrival timefl at the gate and the touchdown point.GIVen Ule schedul es of these aircraft and, for the new aircraft , an estimat e of the minimum and maximu m times to the gate and from tile gate to the touchdo wn point, a techniqu e Is needed to specify feasible times at the gate and at the touchdo wn point such that separati on standar ds between aft'craft are satisfied and tiw aIrcraft lands in mInimu m time.A general algorith m to calculat e Bueh times has been describ ed ill nef. 5. Th!

The trajecto ry begins at llftoff and termina tes at touchdm .'1l,waypoJn t 7. Althoug h thIs trajecto ry can be flo\',rn by a STOL alrcraft , its shape has no sIgnificance hcyond fllustraH ng the constru ctton procedu re.All parts of the trajecto ry consist of segmen ts of straight lines and Circles, with values of turnlng radiJ given in the figure.The basIc problem to be solved can be stated as follows: What Is the cssentJa 11nput informa tion thut the pilot must provide to the airborn e comput er In order to generat e tills trajecto ry unlquely .The solution 11es In the deflnItio n of two types of waypo!n ts. which are referred to as ordinar y IUld fluaI heading waypoln ta. a circle tangent to both Hncs.Thus, the sharp corner at the waypoin t is rounded to obtain a trajecto ry the aircraft can Oy.The radlus of the circle used in roundin g the corner can either be explJcit ly specJflc d by the pilot, as in this example , or It ca.n be impllcJt ly determI ned from a maxlmu m bank angle constra ints, ~max.For a g1vcn ~Illa..x, the minimu m turning radius Hmln depends on the maJi..lnw m ground l'ipced V gma...: that NUl be attained in a 300• tlln) and Is flmln

Flnal lIendlng \VaypoJn tsThis type Is !lIustra ted in Flg. 2 by waypo(n ta 3, 6 and 7. Instead of rounding the corner at the intersec tion of two Unes, Uw trajecto ry for thiR type passes through the waypoln t at the I nstant the turn toward the next waypoin t has been complet ed.Thus. the al reran begIns Its night along the straIght lIne segmen t exactly over the waypoln l.There are two reasons [Of Introduc lng this type o[ waypoint.First, It slmpllfi e!' the speclfic tttion of some trajecto ry segmen ts, such as the turn at waypoin t 3, which contains more than 180~ Hccal! that the turn at an ordInar y waypoln t Is lhnJted to less than 180~, Second.thIs type is rcqulrec If the arrival time at the v:.lypoin t Is specifie d, Speclfic ation of arrival time ut an ordinary waypoin t lacks precisio n since the waypo!n t coonlin~ ;ttes themsel ves do not fall on the trajecto ry.By requirin g all aircraft that are merging to fly through a poInt on the merging path with a common heading , the llsslgnnl Cot of art'lnil times :It the merging wnypoin t can oe used to achieve precise spacing of aircraft .In the spceJfJc atIon of a trajecto ry, ordinar y and flnal heading waypoln ts can be alternat ed In arbitrar y fashion.The general procedu re for calculat ing the trajecto ry l)[lrame ters Is illustra ted In Fig. 4 with a flnal headIng waypoln t, 1, embedd( 'd between waypoin ts 1-1 and i+l of arbitrar y type.As bl..'fore, the trajecto ry Is compute d bach>va rds from the last waypoln t.The fin;ll hC<Idlng , IfIJ+l to be achieved at waypoln t I was previ- ously deternun e':i in the calculat ion for waypolil t 1+1 and Js therefor e II known quantity .It is evident from Fig, 4 that the desJ red final headIng at waypoln t i can be achieve d with two trajecto rIes, one endIng with a left turn, tile other with a right tum.The criterjo n for selectio n is to choose Ow one with the shorter path Jcnf,>th between waypoin ts i-I and 1.To make the selectio n, Ule coordin ates of the Centers of the two turns are calculat ed:x ni ->:i H. sin 1f!i+l ' I Ym Yj + II, cos 1f!j-tl (right turn!

Altftude ProfIleThe calculat lon of the altitude profile is sImple, requirin g only the determi nation of a flight path angle Y l belween waypoln ts J-l and L Since the horizon tal path lenb1h between waypoln ts Is known, the flight path angle Is given by (29)where Sf fs the flOrll-on tal path length, between waypoin ts I and i-I and hi and h) 1 are the altItude s speclfle d at wHypoJn ts I Hod 1~1 le-spect lvely.In order to compute s from the sef:,'11lCn ts of turns and strulght I1nes it is Tho first two condI tions Imply tlwt the flying time betwe en any two poInt s on the trajec tory I s bound ed above nnd below by HlC minIm um nnd maxIm um Urnes corre spond ing to the maxim um and mInim um airsp eeds, respe ctive ly.Conse quent ly, If arriv al times nt the tlIne-contr Qlled wayp olnts ure ussig ned arbltr arfly , then a feasib le speed profil e rn~y not ex.! at.In order to assur e the existn nce of a feasIb le speed profll e, ATe assIg ns orrlv al tllnes baBed on tile minim um and maximum possI ble flying Umes betwe en succe ssive pairs of timecontr olled wayp olnts.The deter mina tion of a feasIb le speed profil e in tile absen ce of \v1nd wOllid be a relati vely simpl e task, for in this case airsp eed and groun dspee d are ident ical.In the prese nce of wind, howe ver, the relatI onshi p Letwe en airsp eed and groun dspee d is highl y nonli near, and the probl em becom es consi derab ly more comp lex.Assu m-ing a stead y wind, the expre ssion for the magn itude of the groun dspee d, V (t), at any time t Is given by: g)7; : --•2 2 V (l) ~ V (t) -V sin ~ (t) + V cos ~ (t) g a w w w w (30)where V,t{t) and Vw are the magn itude s of the airsp eed tind wlnds peed respe ctive ly, nnd Ww(t) 18 the angle from the wind dJ rectio n to the groun d headi ng, /.  ulong the 'clrcu lar arc is given by Eq.

The only remaini ng quantity still to be detenn!ned is tile desired airspee d profile.Since tile earliest and latest possible arrIval Hrnes are achIeve d by flying the aircraft on the boundar ies of the admIssi ble speed ranges, the actual airspee d profile correspo nding to an 1nterrne illate arrival time must He between the speed bounda ries (see FIg. 5).The nonHne ar relatton sh1p between arrival time and airspee d necessi tates the use of an IteratIv e procedu re for the determi nation of t.~e desired airspee d profIle.Basicall y, the procedu re adjusts the cruls1ng Bpeed level between each pnlr of time-co ntrolled waypotn ts so that the prescrlb ed arI"1val times are achieve d.This is done by using express ions of the form (37) and (41).A more detailed dlBcUss ion of the enUre Bpeed profile computa tion can be found In Ref. 6.A final remark concenl illg the wind Is in order.In this paper only the case of steady wind fs consIde red.It is well knov,:n, howeve r, that both the magnitu de and directio n of the wind are function s of ti1C altitude .If theso functIon s were known, they could be easny jncorporuted 1n the speer!profile computa tion.~'tject ory Synthes is: An Exampl eThe precedi ng sectIons describ ed the techniqu es used to calculat e the two mujor element s of u 4-0 trajecto ry, the 3-0 path and the aIrspee d profile along the path.These element s must now be ussemb led to produce the complet e referenc e trajecto ry conSisti ng of the referen ce otates (positio n, altitude and headIng ) and the referen ce controls (turning ratUus, aIrspee d and flight path angle) as a function of tlme from Initial to final time.The i'aferen cc states and comman ds are calculat ed by a procedu re which makes usc of the chosen parame terization of the 4-0 trajecto ry to mlnlmlz .e~omputer storage.The calculat ion is done In two steps.In the flrst step, t1w 3-D pnth and the airspeed acceler ation time hIstory nlong the path are ul'cd to constru ct a comman d table consisti ng of a scquenc e of cootrol Inputs arrange d In chronolo gIcul order.Since the referen ce controls are piecewi se conot.'wt in time, the comman d table givcs the V:1!lICS of tile referenc e controls only at time instants where they change to new constun t values.In the second step.the referenc e states between comman d times are compute d analytic ally from the Initial conditio n at Ow comman d time and the value of the control s during the comman d IntervaL Compar ed to the techniqu e of storing the referenc e trajecto ry at a large number of time instants , thIs techniqu e uses slgnlfic antly less storage , an Importa nt c('>nside ration in Implem enting the techniqu e on an airborn e compute r.The example trajecto ry shov,'ll Hl Fig. 2 Is used to Illustra te the techniqu e of 4-D traJ.<:!ct ory synthes Is describ ed In this paper.The pJlot speeifie s the trajectory to the system by entering the data given in table 1.In the onboard system the waypoln t types are replace d by numeric :,l codes.Both, the Initial posItion (lIft off) and the touchdo wn poInt are treated as final heading wuy-poInts, In synUws Izing the trajecto ry.The initial heading and the runway he:ldlng associa ted with these waypoin ts are bOUI 0° in thls cuse, Final heading waypoint 6 and tile touchdo wn point are time control pOints wIth arrival times of 300 and 350 sec, respecti vely, The wind Is assume d to be from O~at 25 ft/see.The airspeed range BpecWe d for each waypofn t In table 1 is valid from tile end of the turn perforn led at that waypoint to ti10 end of the turn perform ed at the next way- point.ThIs require s choosin g starting times of deceler ations/a ccelerat ion such that the aIrspeo d will faIl In the next speed range at precise ly the end of the turn.These fixed boundar y conditio ns nre met by syn-thesizIn g tho aIrspeed profile backwa rd from the last waypoln t.The 4-D comman d sequenc e generat ed for this input is given 1n table 2.

The m(Xlcl consists of II 10th order dynamic system with hard limits on roll, roll rate, airspeed, airspeed acccl- craUon, flight path angle and flight path angle rate.The actual wind vector Js also an input to the model.Output quantities arc the actual aircraft states.Fl'om Ulcse the navigation system simulatlon obtaIns the measured aircraft states and the estimated wind vector, A complete analysis of simulatlon results cannot be given withIn the length of t.hls paper.We shall show only the response of tiw control law to track a STOL type reference trajectory in the !tori'wntal plane consJsting of a 3GO o circular segment with racUus 1220 ft and alrsjx)ed of 135 ft/sec.The reference trajectory, which has a duration of 5G.7 sec.Is generated WiOl two flnal heading waypoints located on the cIrcle as shown in Fig. D.
