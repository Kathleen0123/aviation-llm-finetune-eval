Desired CPTP PGUI CapabilityThe human factors team conducted a preliminary familiarization and evaluation process during which a number of broad design issues were identified.The human factors concerns related to the CPTP PGUI design were as follows"1. Color a.A color use philosophy did not exist.b. Color was not consistent.c.Color was used extensively and somewhat randomly, thus diluting the impact of its usage.d. Color use did not address the issue that controllers are not currently screened for color blindness.e. Perceptually problematic colors such as saturated reds and blues were widely used.f.Text and graphical information was generally presented in light shades against a black background.,, There was a hardware limitation of eight bit color and a software limitation of a three level color scheme with only three top level colors.2. Display parameters a.No philosophy regarding how and when the PGUI should constrain the user regarding setup of system parameters.b. Large display setup differences were common across users, thus confounding some of the computer human interface (CHI) issues.3. Global display a. Global commands forfunctions such astrend vectors, flightdatablocks, range tings, and range/bearing required difficult torecall keyboard entries.b. Activeaircraft inputs such asspeed, altitude, and routechanges were difficult tomake.c. Track histories were notdisplayed inaformat thatused adequate update rates and symbology.ck Aircraft symbols were displayed using nonstandard textsymbology.e. Zoom andcentering functions were very difficult touse, requiting excessive keyboard entries, a.f. General setup functionality wasdispersed throughout avariety offunction keypanels.g. Helpfunction was limited, outdated, and hard to understand.:_i' _ _'i!i_ 'i !_i_ii!i'!' _!'_ !:i_i i_i _i?? i___iii/i _/1% _ _i_/!i! _ _ ..... _?_ _ii ¸?i!i_ii i_ !_i ? !,iii_iii!il i!ill !!i!i!!_iiii ¸_i_!!!iii!i_i_ _i_!_i_i_!i!i_!_!iii_i!_i!!_!_!!!_!_!!_i!!_i_!i_!_i!ii?!_!!!_iiii_ _!ii_iiii_iiii_i!_!!ii!i!i_i_i_!iiiii!_!_i_ii_ii!ii_!i!_i_iiiiiJ_!_highly interactive and iterative process that included input from human factors, software development, and domain experts.The following is a summary of the design changes that were made in response to the PGUI human factors evaluation.Each item is referenced to the human factors concerns listed in the Desired Capability section above.Following this section is a complete history of the changes made to the CPTP PGUI that will provide the reader with much more detailed information about each of the design changes noted here.
Color Redesign of PGUI(1a-g) Development of a new color design for the PGUI was enabled by the implementation of a double buffer color infrastructure.The double buffer scheme provided access to 127 top level colors, which was enough color flexibility for the implementation of a total PGUI color redesign.
Conflict
Detection Graphics Enhancement
(4a)The graphical conflict ambiguities were addressed by the addition of red conflict prediction lines that extended from the conflict aircraft to the point of first loss of separation.This removed the need for the trial planning panel and related keyboard inputs.
ConflictSimplification and linking of the capture waypoint and auxi!iary waypoint functions were provided along with the simplification of the user input process for vectoring an aircraft.The purpose for these initial changes was to link functionality that was conceptually related and to take a first step in the evolution of a trial planning functionality.There was no easy way for the user to dete_ne whether a predicted conflict in an active trajectory had been resolved.The initial solution was to put an "R" for resolved in the time slot of the conflict prediction list.Conflict resolution enhancement (5c)-Initially, there was no easy way for the user to determine whether a predicted conflict in an active trajectory had been resolved, as the user had to monitor the conflict list and note when separation criteria had been met.The initial solution was to put an "R" for resolved in the time slot of the conflict prediction list.The "R" proved to be a good preliminary fix, but something more salient was required for a better graphical representation of trial plan resolution status.For that reason, a Trial Conflicts list was designed as shown in figure 11 to allow the user easy access to resolution information.The user was then able to determine whether sending the aircraft "direct to" that new VOR would resolve the predicted conflict.If the Trial Conflicts list showed that this maneuver would solve the problem, then the user could use the new heading and time advisories provided (in green) next to the aircraft symbol and issue them as a clearance totheaircraft.Afterissuing theclearance theycould then accept, andhence activate, thechange totheaircraft's route offlightbyleftclickingontheyellow"V."
PGUI CPTP user manual (9a)-If the"direct to"vector mode trialplandidnot provide a resolution fortheconflict, anauxiliary waypoint could be used tobuildanewroutefortheaircraft that wouldsolve theconflict.Afterthedefault VORhasbeen chosen, left clicking anywhere ontheredPFS route would create an auxiliary waypoint.Theuser could thenmiddle clickand dragtheauxiliary waypoint untilthePFS route changed toyellow, indicating aconflict freerouteasshown in figure13.Thecontroller could thenissue theprovided heading andtimetoturnback tothefiledroute offlightas aclearance totheaircraft.When thealtitude trialplanfunctionality wasaccessed, an altitude trialplanboxappeared withtheaircraft's current altitude highlighted asthedefault andallother possible altitudes listedabove andbelow it asshown infigure14.Analtitude fortrialplanning wasselected byleftclicking onthedesired altitude in thelist.When atrialplan altitude wasselected, theletters "TP"and theselected altitude appeared inyellowonthefifthlineoftheFDBas seen infigure15.When thespeed trialplanning functionality wasaccessed, aspeed trialplanpop-up appeared withalistofspeed modes (Ascent IAS,Descent IAS,Cruise IAS,Cruise MACH) asseen infigure16.Leftclicking onthedesired speed mode produced aspeed +/-IASorMACHvalue boxshown in figure17.Thetrialplan+/-IASorMACH speed (indicate +/-fromcurrent speed, i.e., +30or-30) wasselected byleftclicking onthedesired value.The current "active" indicated airspeed and thenew trialplan inputvalue +/-were displayed in yellowonthefifthline oftheflightdatablockasshown in figure18.The design changes that were actually incorporated in preparation for the CPTP Field Test are listed below:The default capture waypoint for arrival aircraft was specified as the meter fix.The default capture waypoint was always specified beyond the point of conflict.The initial pop-up window for vector trial planning was deleted from the design and the capture waypoint list displayed immediately with the default capture waypoint highlighted.A reject button was also included at the top of the list.4. When a conflict was resolved and "R" appeared in the time to go field in the conflict prediction list, the conflict aircraft callsign in line four of the FDB was removed.
Theconflict probability colorcoding intheconflict listwasmade user selectable fromtheF9ConflictProbe setup panel.6. Theconflict graphic display wasmade accessible through point andclickfunctionality viathefourth lineof theFDB.7. Aglobal trialplanclear function wasimplemented using a "shift-t"input.8. Thesector number in line1,field2oftheFDBwas replaced withthedestination airport three letter identifier.9. The "TP" text label was used for all trial plan modes.10.All of the heading advisories provided by the system were displayed in full three digit standard nomenclature.
The time and distance components of the ConflictPrediction list were displayed rounded up to the five mile critical separation value as shown in figure 19.
PGUI CPTP user manual enhanced (9a, b)-CPTP UserManual Release 1.0 was updated with all the new software and functionality changes and Release 2.0 was released for printing.There are ongoing updates and addenda to the current c.
Color sensitivity:The human eye is more sensitive to colors in the yellowish green portion of the spectrum than to reds and blues.As a result, saturated greens and yellows will appear to be brighter (hence more conspicuous)than saturated reds and blues.Blue has a particularly low subjective brightness.
d.Use of color with lettering: Dark lettering on a light background is more legible than light lettering on a dark background.e.
Color discrimination:Small changes in green and yellow are easier to detect than small changes of red or blue.f.Color and peripheral vision: Reds and greens are not resolved in peripheral vision as easily as blues and yellows.
Use of a variety of colors:The fewer the colors used the greater the impact on the user.
h.Use of alerting colors: Alerting colors should only be used for alerting functions.
Additional FunctionalityThere are additional proposed design changes related to new functionality for the CPTP PGUI as follows:1. Incorporation of point and click functionality to provide easy access to PFS and flight plan routes for new aircraft entering the sector.
2.Provision of user request "autoprobe" to monitor aircraft and allow delivery of request as soon as an aircraft is in conflict free status.3. Presentation of "hard" versus "soft" conflict status.Hard conflicts are those predicted where there is no clearance expected between an aircraft and the predicted point of conflict, and soft conflicts are those where there is a clearance expected that will result in a conflict.Aircraft track histories to be consistent with radar histories in shape and update rate.The aircraft symbol to be redesigned to a circle enclosing a triangular pointer giving aircraft direction.Flat track/free track information to be made available through the flight data block.Zoom and centering functionality to be redesigned.The current zoom and centering functionality is quite crude and can easily result in disorientation of the display.Trial plan routes to be drawn thicker.Flight plan amendment panel to be redesigned to provide support for trial planning and active inputs and possibly extend to provide total paper strip replacement.
Global Display Commands (3a, c, e)There were design suggestions related to the implementation of a button bar for global commands (some of which are currently driven from the keyboard and some of which are additional functionality), including trend vectors, trial plan clear, flight data block quick deconflict, strip management, range and bearing, future situation display, zoom/center, latitude/longitude of cursor, and track histories.
Proposed
Redesign of Selected Graphical Elements(lf) Flight data blocks to have backfill and borders identifying alert and planning status.(2a, 3b) Mouse inputs to be redesigned to use a standard of action method: left button for action (selection of specific menu items), middle button for move (drag), and fight button for planning (access to menus)._i _ _i _i __ _i_ _ _i _ _ _ _ _ _,_ _ _i _ _!

Occlusion of traffic display a.Large setup panels and pop-up windows occlude the traffic display at the start of operation.b.Conflict prediction list can occlude traffic easy to provide design suggestions in an ideal world of limitless resources.The more challenging situation is the application of sound principles in an environment that demands constant compromise in order to meet resource constraints and the limitations of existing hardware and software architecture.Decisions of this sort were and are made on a daily basis during PGUI (and all CTAS related) design and implementation processes and required knowledge of system hardware and software as well as general human factors principles.It is important to realize that in the development of an automated system, an engineering interface will evolve that meets the initial prototyping needs of the researchers (the PGUI as it existed in November 1996 was such an engineering interface).The use, and therefore the design, of an engineering interface is likely to be quite different from the kind of CHI that will be demanded by an end user.There are principles of design that can be applied in the development of an end user CHI and it is important to realize that these principles might conflict with the personal preferences of individual researchers who are likely to have adapted to the engineering interface.It is also important to note that, while end user input is quite important in CHI design, end users are not qualified interface designers.An interface design will serve its purpose most effectively if it is designed using basic human performance and design principles as well as domain specific expert input and engineering expertise.The design process used in the implementation of the PGUI changes documented here was arrived at through an interdisciplinary and .... ?!_?i, _ i...... ¸¸_¸_ _,_ ..... ........... _ _ _iii _''¸i:¸_ i!?_ ii_i!!i!i_': :i! _i i_?? _: __
b) A multitrajectory capability was designed and implemented by the engineering team that allowed the system to display both a trial plan trajectory that could be manipulated by the user and the active aircraft trajectory that displayed the actual position of the aircraft.Trial plan graphics were developed for altitude, speed, and vector changes using the new multiple trajectory capability.In addition to the multiple trajectory graphics, a panel was developed for use in trial planning inputs.This preliminary attempt at a "real" trial planning functionality allowed for situation awareness of the active trajectory while in trial planning mode and was the second large step in the evolution of the trial planning functionality.As trial planning functionality was tested and evaluated by human factors, engineering, and end user teams, there was a strong consensus reached that the functionality had to evolve to a point and click interface that would remove the end user's hands from the keyboard.The point and click functionality the aircraft's flight data block.
to producing only one trajectory per aircraft so that all trial resolutions were conducted using active trajectory inputs.The active inputs for speed and altitude were complex but manageable, as long as the user followed the right sequence.The user inputs required to examine various routing changes were disordered and quite unmanageable.For this reason, the redesign process began with a focus on the routing functionality needed for planning a direct waypoint or vectoring maneuver.A direct waypoint maneuver consists of sending an aircraft direct to a waypoint in the filed route of flight.A vector maneuver consists of giving an aircraft a heading off the filed route of flight and then having the aircraft rejoin the filed route of flight at either a waypoint in the filed route or an auxiliary waypoint that is created by the system.The first change to the CPTP vector trial plan functionality included a simplification and linking of the capture waypoint and auxiliary waypoint functions used to vector aircraft.Additionally, the user input process for vectoring an aircraft was greatly simplified.The purpose for these initial changes was to link functionalities that were conceptually related and to take a first step in the evolution of a trial planning functionality.March 1997 Conflict resolution enhancement (5a, b)-The CTAS CPTP system was initially limited to the construction of one PFS route per aircraft.This limitation resulted in an inability to display the active trajectory during trial planning.The loss of active trajectory situation awareness was not considered to be acceptable, and engineering redesign to provide dual trajectory capability was required.A new multitrajectory capability was designed and implemented by the engineering team that allowed the system to display both a trial plan trajectory that could be manipulated by the user and the active aircraft trajectory that displayed the actual position of the aircraft.Trial plan graphics were developed for altitude, speed, and vector changes using the new multiple trajectory capability.In addition to the multiple trajectory graphics, a panel was developed for use in trial planning inputs.This preliminary attempt at a "real" trial planning functionality allowed for situation awareness of the active trajectory while in trial planning mode and was the second large step in the evolution of the functionality.The user entered trial plan mode by dwelling on the aircraft to be trial planned and typing "shift-t."The trial plan panel, shown in figure 7, would appear next to the aircraft.The trial plan panel allowed the user to trial plan
The original PGUI user manual was found in the initial human factors evaluation to be outdated and inaccurate.An effort was begun to incorporate the CPTP functionality and PGUI setup parameters into a CPTP User's Guide.Release 1.0 of the Conflict Prediction and Trial Planning User's Guide was completed on March 31, 1997 (ref.2).April-May 1997 Conflict resolution enhancement (5a, b)-As trial planning functionality was tested and evaluated by human factors, engineering, and end user teams, there was a strong consensus reached that the functionality had to evolve to a point and click interface that would remove the end user's hands from the keyboard.The point and click functionality was to be accessed through the relevant fields on the aircraft's flight data block.This removed the need for the trial planning panel and related keyboard inputs.Access to the trial plan vector mode was made via a dwell and right click on the callsign located on the first line, first field of the aircraft's FDB.Altitude trial plans were accessed via altitude information on the second line, first field of the FDB.Speed trial plans were accessed via the speed information located on the third line, second field of the FDB.Additionally, flight plan information (not strictly speaking a trial plan function) was accessed via the aircraft's sector identifier number located in the first line, second field of the FDB.All trial planning was accomplished with point and click graphics and pop-up menus which provided text, _aphics, and color cues regarding the trial plan modes and status.Trial planning mode information was provided in yellow text on the fifth line of the FDB.Upon accessing the Vector trial planning capability,-a Vector menu pop-up would appear asking the user to select "change capture waypoint" option, "auxiliary waypoint" option, or reject (to exit).(This first menu pop-up proved to be an unnecessary extra step and was soon deleted.)The next menu pop-up (which soon became the first menu option box) enabled the user to select a capture waypoint.The system defaulted to the next VOR in the aircraft's flight plan and the user selected an alternative if desired.A yellow "V" appeared in the fifth line of the trial plan aircraft's FDB to indicate that the aircraft was in Vector trial plan mode as seen in figure 12.
.designed to provide researcher access to the color parameters for each of the PGUI elements.The ability to easily respecify the red, green, blue, and brightness values of each PGUI element is crucial for any color effort.The new color infrastructure provided the extended color capability needed to address elements 1a-f of the human factors evaluation.Controller evaluation of the CPTP PGUI-An informal end user evaluation was conducted at this point in the PGUI design process.Three air traffic controllers representing FAA Headquarters, Boston ARTCC, and Fort Worth ARTCC were asked to use and evaluate the CPTP PGUI functionality during a two day period.The controllers also evaluated the training materials and user's guide that were being developed concurrently with the PGUI.Design suggestions were sorted into three categories: changes to make immediately in preparation for field test, longer term redesign changes to existing functionality, and completely new functionality.The design suggestions are listed below along with whether they were immediate changes (I), redesign of current functionality (R), or completely new functions (N): 1.The default capture waypoint for arrivals should be the meter fix.The default capture waypoint should always be beyond the predicted conflict point.(I) 2. When vector trial plan is selected by clicking on the aircraft callsign, the initial pop-up window should be deleted from the design and the capture waypoint list should be displayed with the default capture waypoint highlighted.A reject button should be included at the top of the list.(R) and (I) 3. The conflict aircraft callsign for a trial plan, which is currently displayed on the forth line of the FDB, should be deleted.(R) (Note: restored later after further consideration.)4. When a conflict is resolved and "R" appears in conflict prediction list, the conflict aircraft callsign in the fourth line of the FDB should be removed.(N) and (I) 5.The conflict probability color coding in the conflict list should be user selectable from the F9 Conflict Probe setup panel so that color coding may be turned off if desired.(N) 6. Infrastructure and PGUI panel should be colored to allow the following: a. Aircraft not owned or in conflict should have a low conspicuity relative to conflict aircraft.(N) b.Aircraft not owned or in conflict should have a limited data block (altitude only).(N) c.New aircraft symbols that show direction should be incorporated.(N) d.Red, yellow, and green colors should be reserved for conflict status.(R) should be clear (clear whole screen of all trial plans via keyboard input).(N) Capability to dwell and click on all PGUI elements that are not part of trial plan function should be turned off when in trial planning mode.(R) 10.Flight plan route should not be displayed when a trial plan is activated.(R) 11.In line 1, field 2 of data block, sector number should be replaced with destination airport three letter identifier.(R) and (I) July 1997 PGUI CPTP training material developed (9b)-Development of the Conflict Prediction and Trial Planning tool training packet to be used for training air traffic controllers at Ames and at the Denver ARTCC was completed.National Air Traffic Control Research Institute (NARI) controller evaluation of the PGUI-A second evaluation of the CPTP PGUI was conducted with input provide by NARI controllers from New York ARTCC, Chicago ARTCC, Houston ARTCC, and Los Angeles ARTCC.The controllers participated in one day of training on the use of the Conflict Prediction and Trial Planning tool followed by one day of simulations and evaluations.to transition between the use of the conflict list and the conflict graphics.Provide access to the conflict graphics via the conflict aircraft callsign in the fourth line of the FDB.(N) and (I) .It was difficult to determine whether an aircraft was in conflict with more than one other aircraft.The system needs to provide explicit information (text or , , graphics) about all aircraft that a single aircraft is in conflict with.(N) There is too much clutter when all conflict aircraft data blocks are displayed.The system needs to provide a way to dim or suppress conflict data blocks.(N) The flight plan amendment panels need to be redesigned into a single panel and should provide feedback to the user when flight plan amendments are made.(R) Do not use "V" for vector in trial plan, it means VFR.(R) and (I) Display all heading advisories in a three digit format (standard nomenclature).(R) Place aircraft callsign on the route lines for ease of identification.(N) Remove altitude information from the conflict list.It is not used and it is confusing.(R) The accept function on trial plans needs to be easier and quicker to use.(R) 10.If an aircraft is "close" to the next waypoint in its route of flight, make the default capture waypoint the fix after rather than the next one.(I) 11.In the conflict list always round down to four miles if the separation is not five miles.(R) and (I) 12. Display conflict probe parameters (F9 setup panel information) on conflict prediction list for situation awareness purposes.(N) August 1997
Release 2.0 of the Conflict Prediction and Trial Planning User's Guide (ref.3).There is also ongoing development of quick reference guides and training materials to serve as an adjunct to the user manual.PGUI CPTP training material developed (9b)-A CPTP training packet was completed for use in training air traffic controllers at the Denver ARTCC who were scheduled to participate in the CPTP field study.color design for the PGUI was enabled by the implementation of the double buffer color infrastructure.Some suggestions to be considered in a redesign of use of color on the PGUI are as follows: 1.A general philosophy of color use should be articulated prior to the beginning of the design process so that color use will be consistent throughout the display.A standard philosophy of color use in displays is that of color defined visual layers.The layers are defined by variation in color contrast, hue, .saturation, number, and size of similarly colored features.If the color factors defining layers are manipulated correctly, the user will tend to group the appropriate objects in a layer.For air traffic control displays, a back layer might consist of a sector map and related static information displayed in low saturation colors of similar hue.A middle layer might consist of aircraft, data blocks, and related dynamic information in a more conspicuous color range than the back layer.A top layer might consist of alerting information in the most conspicuous color range.Color should be used with care, as improper use of color can lead to eye strain, optical illusions, and cue confusion that can result in operator errors.A few basic principles are listed below: a. Use of saturated blues and reds: Shorter wavelengths of light (blue) are refracted more than longer wavelengths of light (red) as they enter the eye.As a result, reds and blues are brought into focus at different points within the structure of the eye.Constant refocusing is therefore necessary to resolve reds and blues, and this can lead to eye strain.b.Use of contrasting colors: Color contrast can result in figure ground illusions, particularly when using bright, highly saturated colors.

Graphical information consisted ofsmall red asterisks marking the point of initial loss ofseparation accompanied by a textual listing of the con-flicting aircraft callsign above the asterisk. Consequently,it was difficult to determine which two aircraft were inconflict from either textual or graphical information.Thetextual presentation of conflict informationwas accom-plished by the addition of the conflict aircraft callsigndisplayed in red in the fourth line of the data block asAnauxiliary waypoint (white asterisk) wascreated witha leftmouse clickonthePFS route.A center mouse click was used todrag thenewauxiliary waypoint todesired position (fig.6).Thesystem wasable toupdate theroute quickly enough toprovide arubber band effect in the construction ofatrialroute.Theuser wasable toexitthe auxiliary waypoint mode withadwell and leftclickonthe aircraft.
