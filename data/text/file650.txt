Previous Relevant ResearchTo control altitude in a hovering helicopter, pilots likely use many feedbacks," but they at least close the two outer loops shown in Fig. 1.The feedback of vertical rateof-climb is important, as pilots are' basically controlling vertical acceleration with collective position, and the feedback of only altitude to a collective command would result in a poorly damped closed-loop system.Visual flow rate is the angular rate that an object moves in the visual scene.It is proportional to speed and inversely proportional to the distance from the contour or object.The number of contours or objects that pass by in a given time measures visual edge rate.It is also proportional to speed, but it is inversely proportional to the object's size.Studies have shown that some people inappropriately use edge rate when flow rate would be more appropriate,13 some are more sensitive to one or the other,14 some adapt over time," and that the ability to switch between the two may not be consciously possible but may depend on unconscious perceptual ~kil1s.l~The studies agree that both cues contribute towards speed and acceleration perception, but edge rate may have a more pronounced effect."Figure 2 shows two objects placed at the same distance in front of an observer, and each object moves upwards with a speed v. Object 2 has twice the spatial f&quency of object 1, since its pattern repeats twice as often per degree Subtended at the observer's eye.For the same speed, v, the edge rate provided by object 2 is twice that of object 1, but the flow rates provided by both are the same.V tR R-r.
Object 1Object 2 Figure 2 -Spatial frequency example If observers gaze separately at one of the above objects, previous research indicates that the perceived velocity of object 2 will be greater than' that of object 1 .I*However, the perceived increase in velocity depends on the increase in spatial frequency.That is, object 2 will not seem to move twice as fast as object 1, even though the spatial frequency has been doubled.Specifically, Ref. 18 found a 31% increase in perceived velocity when the spatial l?equency was doubled from 0.016.to 0.033 cyclesJdeg.When the spatial frequency was quadrupled (from 0.016 to 0.066 cycles/deg), the perceived increase in velocity was 240%.An additional result is that if the two objects moved at the same speed and had the same spatial frequency, the one covering the larger field-of-view seems to move slower."The above results are for a fixed gaze.If, instead, the eyes track the moving object, the perceived speed is less than with the eyes fmed.The disparity between the eye-tracked and the eye-fixed 'perception decreases as the spatial frequency decreases.IgIn fact, with an object consisting of a single edge, the disparity disappears.Platform motion research.The effects of vertical platform motion on helicopters for tracking and disturbance rejection tasks were examined by Bray.4He concluded that the phase fidelity of the yeitical acceleration cues should be accurate down to l&1.5 radlsec.This conclusion was reached using several qualitatively different natural scenes, including tracking over a runway and behind a target aircraft.Sinacori suggested a useful translational platform motion criterion based upon considerable experience by him and others in the simulation field?That criterion compares the accelerations provided to the .pilot.by the motion platform against those produced .by the simulation mathematical model.Taking a 1 rad&c math model acceleration as an input and the simulator platform acceleration at 1 rad/sec as the resulting output, the damping root at -0.122 is augmented by a lead-lag that relative attenuation and phase shift between these two approximates the effect of dynamic inflow.All states in signals is plotted.the other vehicle degrees-of-freedom remained zero.Figure 3 shows such a plot with the six platform motion configurations examined in this study, as later discussed.Sinacori conducted a limited study to validate his suggested fidelity boundaries?Reference 7 documents a detailed validation of the criterion and suggested modifications to the fidelity boundaries, which are those of Fig. 3.However, systematic variations in the visual cues were not made during the criterion's validation.Motion Svstem.The vertical axis of the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS), shown in Figure 4, was used.Reference 21 gives a detailed description of the simulator and facility.The large vertical travel of the VMS allows pilots to fly reasonable altitude-repositioning tasks without any motion cue attenuation.The phase response of the vertical-axis servo dynamics matches an equivalent time delay of 120 msec.As discussed above, eqn. 1 needs.an additional 60 msec of time delay in order to be representative of the AH-64.Rather than insert this additional 60 msec in the math model, it was more than subsumed by the 120 msec of motion system delay.Thus, the visual and motion cues in the vertical axis of this AH-64 simulation had 60 msec more delay than would be expected in the actual vehicle.This amount of additional delay is within that allowed for FAA helicopter training sim&tors.'_ Visual Svstem.The experiment used the Evans and Sutherland ESIG 3000 image generator.A pure time delay was added to the nominal visual system time delay so that the total visual delay from stick input to image refresh was 120 msec.Thus, the visual and motion time delays were effectively identical.The VMS's RCAB was used, but the visual scene was presented on only the top three windows (the chin window was not used in order to prevent the ground from being viewed in the "no background" visual case discussed later).The horizontal field-of-view spans &78 degrees, and the vertical field-of-view spans -16 to 12 degs for the upper three windows, as shown in the Fig. 6 Hammer chart.This available field-of-view is less than that in most actual helicopters.4Figure 6 -Cockpit field-of-view Cockpit.The only cockpit control was a left-handed collective from a UH-60 Black Hawk.This collective was freely moving (not spring loaded), with static friction that could be adjusted by the pilot.No instruments were present, so that the pilot had to extract all cues from the motion system, the visual system, and the inceptor characteristics.Subjects.Five pilots participated in the study.Four of the pilots were rotorcraft test pilots with extensive experience.The fifth pilot had minimal helicopter experience, but significant fixed-wing jet transport experience.Four pilots were from NASA Ames, and one from the U.S. Army at Fort Rucker.
Task and ProceduresThe task consisted of four segments, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Pilots started at a 45-r?hover 150-e in front of a 4-ft diameter red disk.The first segment was a 32-ft.ascent to the 4-ft diameter red disk at the top of the diagram.Pilots pushed a button with their right hand when initiating this first segment.After placing a set of crosshairs fixed on the canopy within the red disk, and when confident that the crosshairs could be maintained within that disk, the pilots again pushed a button to start the second task segment.In this segment the pilot had to stabilize for IO-set, keeping the crosshairs within .thered disk.The third segment was a 32-ft descent to the bottom red disk, again with button pushes beginning and terminating the reposition.The final segment was a loset stabilization keeping the crosshairs within the bottom q-150 ft--Figure 7 -Altitude repositioning taskThe performance standards for each segment am given in Table 1.A set of colored lights on top of the cockpit panel indicated the performance to the pilots for each task segment.After completing the task, pilots assigned a Cooper-Harper.handling qualities rating," a Motion Fidelity rating (using the definitions in  Three stripe widths were tested: 2 ft, 8 ft, and 32 ft.The vertical plane containing the stripes was 150 feet in front of the pilot's eyes.These widths correspond to spatial frequencies of 0.65,0.16,and 0.041 cycles/deg, respectively, as measured directly in front of the pilot's eyes.

ConfimrationsThe two variables K-and w, for the motion filter of Fig. 5 were varied as shown in Table 3.The filter's damping ratio was held constant at 0.7.These values were selected to span a range of predicted motion fidelities per the criterion in Ref. 7, and each configuration number is plotted on Fig. 3.These predicted fidelities apply to tasks that have both tracking and disturbance rejection components.Here, no disturbances were present, so the task involved only tracking.For tracking-only tasks, previous work has shown that the predicted motion fidelity is affected by motion filter natural frequency, rather than by motion filter gain4*' As such, the predicted fidelity for the configurations with K=O.5 would be expected to be that for K=l.O at each corresponding natural frequency.This is reflected in the last column of Table 3.The amount of platform travel requited for particular filter depends upon the frequency content of the task.For the full motion configuration (K=l.O, o,=O.OO), if a pilot stays within the desired performance boundaries for the altitude reposition, the required platform travel would be 36 ft (32 ft between the two points plus 2 ft of allowed error at both ends).The amount of platform motion required for the other two configurations for which K=l was determined by randomly sampling 10 runs for each motion configuration and finding the range of platform motion used in each during the task.The mean and standard error of the travel required for the K=l, 0,=0.52 configuration was 19.0&0.9 ft and for the K=l, o&=0.89configuration was 12.4ti.8ft.When the The stripes were presented without and with a background, as shown in Figs. 8 and9.The red disks, representing the ascent and descent end points, and the crosshairs are also shown in both figures.The position of the crosshairs indicates that the aircraft is centered between the two red disks.The numerals on Figs. 8 and9 were not shown to the pilot.Without the background, the stripes covered the entire field-of-view across all three windows.With a background, the stripes were on a vertical board 4 feet wide.A sky and flat textured ground plane, including a runway (giving some familiar size cues), was behind this vertical board.The sky and ground plane projected into both side windows.Since the horizon is always level with the pilot's eyes, it cuts through the vertical board at that particular eye height.This provides a very compelling height cue.Also, with the background, the visual scene was more natural appearing, and it was chosen as a configuration to break the monotony of flying against the laboratory-like scene without the background.
Figure 8 -Visual scene without backgroundEven with this simple background scene, many additional visual cues for altitude and altitude rate become available.These cues include the additional visual flow rate from the contours on the ground, and angular size changes of the ground polygons, and the interposition cues arising from areas behind the vertical board appearing and disappearing during altitude changes.Reference 24 reported that pilots make effective use of the depression angles to lines that ate orthogonal to the forward gaze in order to control altitude.Specifying these cues quantitatively is more difficult than in the laboratory-like scene without a background, and no attempt was made to do so.Here we can only determine whether or not these additional cues had an effect on pilot performance or opinion.The configurations were randomized and unknown to the pilots.
ResultsBoth objective and subjective data were ,analyzcd.The objective data consisted of the time to ascend and descend between the targets and the maximum error at the top and bottom targets.These four measures were examined, since the pilot based the performance part of his subjective handling qualities rating on these four measures (Table 1).The subjective data analyzed consisted of the handling qualities ratings, motion fidelity ratings, and pilot induced oscillation ratings.To determine how both the objective and subjective measures depended upon the experimental manipulations, a repeated measnres analysis of variance was performed.25Only the statistically significant results (pcO.05) ate reported.This means that the odds of being incorrect in saying a particular measure was affected by a particular manipulation (rather than the difference being due to chance) is less than one in twenty.All of the subsequent plots are in a consistent format in that means and error bars indicating the standard error of the mean are plotted.The standard error of the mean provides a confidence band around the experimentally determined mean.The probability that the true mean of the entire pilot population lies outside twice the error bars is less than one in twenty.
Obiective Performance DataTracking error at uouer disk.Motion filter natural frequency and scene background each affected tracking error at the upper disk.No. interactions among the manipulations occurred.Figure 10 shows the means bounded by the standard errors of the mean for the maximum tracking error at the upper disk as the motion filter natural frequency varied (p=O.O03).Here each mean is determined from the runs with motion filter natural frequencies of 0.00, 0.52, and 0.89 rad/sec, respectively, regardless of the other manipulations, since no interactions were found in the statistical analysis.So, it can be said that the motion filter natural frequency affected tracking error independent of the other variables in the experiment.As indicated, there are 60 points used for each mean (5 pilots x 2 motion filter gains x 3 spatial frequencies x 2 scene backgrounds).All means were in the &2 ft desired performance range about the center of the disk (Table 1).Tracking error degraded as the natural frequency of the filter increased.This is consistent with previous results, which have shown that the distortion introduced by the motion filter natural frequency reduces the phase margin of the tracking ioop, which in turn negatively impacts the closed-loop damping ratio of the pilot-vehicle system.4*7More overshoots occur, and larger maximum tracking errors then follow.Although having the stripes span the entire field-of-view provided extremely precise altitude and altitude rate information, pilots performed slightly worse overall without the background versus with it.Although Ref. 13 showed that perceived speed becomes slower as the stimulus field becomes larger, more than just stimulus field size varied here.As discussed earlier, pilots also received additional altitude and speed cues from having the natural background.In addition, the presence of the horizon line always showing the pilot's height relative to the vertical board was likely a compelling and precise altitude cue.Tracking error at lower disk.Motion filter natural frequency was a main effect for the tracking at the lower target.However, in addition, a two-way interaction occurred among motion filter natural frequency and background presence.The other two objective performance measures in the task were time to ascend and descend between the targets.No statistically significant effects were found in going to the upper target, but a three-way interaction among motion filter gain, motion filter natural frequency, and spatial frequency occurred when going to the lower target (p=O.O05).Plots of this complex interaction did not reveal any interpretable trend.-Figure 12 shows the effect of motion filter natural frequency (p=O.O03).Again, tracking error degraded as motion filter natural frequency increased as with the upper disk.The interaction is shown in Fig. 13 @=0.031),but the interaction does not appear particularly strong.The error appears to perhaps be worse in going from 0.00 to 0.52 radlsec with the background scene than without the background and vice versa when going from 0.52 to 0.89 rad/sec.One may ask why motion filter gain did not affect i' A++$ +i e-4 -J 42 n=308 lthe tracking error in this experiment.The fact that no t: gain effects were revealed is consistent with previous results in Refs 4 and 7. Since this was a tracking task in z which the pilot generates all of his or her motion, the 5 I-effect of motion filter gain is not an influence for vehicles 3 with reasonable control sensitivities.It is when a s! disturbance rejection task is added, in which the pilot does not generate all of the motion, that motion filter gain has 0 an effect.4r70.00 0.52 0.89 As to why spatial frequency did not have an effect on Motion filter nat.freq., rad/sec tracking error is unknown.Perhaps a large enough range Figure 13 -Effect of motion filter f.o,, and scene in spatial frequency was not examined.Or, pilots may background on lower tracking error have been able to extract sufficient velocity cues using the angular rate of the edges as opposed to using the edge rate of the objects.Subiective Performance Data Handling aualities ratings.Motion filter natural frequency and the visual background again were the main effects.Also, a three-way interaction among motion filter gain, motion filter natural frequency, and visual background accurred @=0.032).Figure 14 shows that the motion filter natural frequency affected handling qualities ratings (p=O.OOl).As the natural frequency increased, the handling qualities degraded one point from just over 3 to slightly over 4.Only the natural frequency of 0.00 rad/sec received Level 1 ratings on average.Motion filter nat.freq., rad/sec Figure 14 -Motion filter co, effect on HQRs Figure 15 shows that HQRs were better with the visual background than without it (p=O.O14).However, the mean differences were not as great as the variations caused by motion filter natural frequency.Since desired performance, on average, was achieved by the tested configurations, the differences in HQRs were attributed to variations in the required pilot compensation.Motion fidelitv ratings.As with the handling qualities ratings, motion filter natural frequency and the visual background were the main effects on motion fidelity ratings.Figure 16 shows that motion fidelity degraded as the motion filter natural frequency increased (p=O.O02).A motion filter natural frequency of 0.00 resulted in a mean rating between high and medium.When increased to 0.52 radlsec, the average rating was medium, and that rating decreased to below medium for the highest natural frequency tested.As discussed when the motion fidelities were predicted in Table 3, motion filter natural frequency is the primary determinant of motion fidelity for tracking tasks without a disturbance rejection component.For the three natural frequencies tested, one would expect the motion fidelities to be nearly high, medium, and low, for 0.00,0.52,and 0.89 rad/sec, respectively.Here, the 0.52 radlsec case was exactly as predicted.The 0.00 rad/sec case was on the borderline between high and medium.The 0.89 radkc case was worse than the 0.52 rad/sec configuration, but did not receive average ratings of low, as the criterion would predict.
Low :0.00 0.52 0.89 Motion filter nat.freq., rad/sec Figure 16 -Effect of motion filter o, on motion fidelity rating Figure 17 repeats the criterion shown previously in Fig. 3 but with the means (and their standard error) of the data for each of the six motion configurations added These means arise from assigning numbers to the ratings as follows: Low = 1, Medium = 2, and High = 3.So, for the averages, it is reasonable to draw dividing lines between the fidelity regions to be: Low I 1.5, 1.5 < Medium I 2.5, and 2.5 < High.Recall from the discussion of Fig. 3. that the criterion applies to tasks combining tracking and disturbance rejection.If only tracking was performed, as was the case here, then gain variations normally do not affect fidelity.Figure 17 shows this to be the case.Configurations 1, 2, 4, and 5 are in excellent agreement with the above discussion (which is effectively consistent with the discussion of Fig. 16).Data for configurations 3 and 6 did not agree with the criterion's prediction, although configuration 6 is nearing Low fidelity.Also motion filter gain may be having a slight effect at this high level of phase distortion.So, it may be plausible to raise the Mediumto-Low fidelity border near the criterion's y-axis in light of these results.As shown in Fig. 18, the presence of a background improved perceived motion fidelity @=0.046).This result is somewhat surprising.One might expect no difference between having or not having the natural visual background present, as the rating is a motion fidelity rating., Yet pilots rated the no background case as having poorer motion fidelity.Perhaps the lack of any real world objects (such as the runway) without the background made the determination of how the vehicle was actually moving more difficult.This difficulty may have affected their impression of the motion fidelity.
ConclusionsA piloted simulation evaluated the effects of changes in platform motion, visual scene spatial frequency, and visual scene background in an altitude control task for a helicopter.Pilots controlled only altitude and had to accurately move between two points 32 feet apart within a specified time.Six motion configurations were tested that included one configuration in which the pilot physically moved the full 32 ft required in the task.Three spatial frequencies and the presence or lack of a natural visual background were evaluated.As motion filter natural frequency increased, tracking error, handling qualities rating, motion fidelity rating, and pilot-induced oscillation rating degraded.No statistically significant effects of motion filter gain changes were found on the above measures.These results are consistent with previous data on tracking tasks without disturbances.However, at the highest level of motion filter phase distortion tested, there was some indication the motion filter gain might be a factor.When a natural sky-earth background was included in the visual scene, tracking error, handling qualities rating, and motion fidelity rating improved.Motion fidelity changed slightly when the background was added; however, these changes were small compared to the motion filter effects.Figure 18 -Background effect on motion fidelity rating No effects of the spatial frequency variations were found.Since pilots were a fixed horizontal distance from the object on which the spatial frequency variations were made, perhaps they instead used visual flow rate (angular rate) of the elements in the visual scene.For a particular vehicle velocity, this flow rate does not change when the spatial frequency changes as long as a fixed distance from the object is maintained.Overall, the motion fidelity criterion was good pmdictor of fidelity including these visual scene variations.This was especially the case for platform motion filters with low-to-moderate levels of phase distortion.When the motion filter had a high gain and high phase distortion, the criterion underpredicted the fidelity, aud adjustment of its boundaries may be warranted.
RecommendationsThree values of spatial frequency were examined in this experiment.Future experiments should evaluate a wider range, perhaps focusing on larger, rather than smaller spatial frequencies.The lowest value tested here was 0.041 cycles/deg, and such values would seem to be easily achievable by any modem flight simulator visual system.Thus, it would seem little value would gained by testing even lower spatial frequency values.Also, the variation in visual scene backgrounds here was qualitative rather than quantitative.Additional systematic visual scene variations should be measured and examined to determine what influence they might have on motion fidelity criteria.These effects should be examined in disturbance rejection tasks and tracking tasks.1.

4.5.Figure 1 -1Figure 1 -Outer loops in altitude control Visual research.Pilots must determine rate-of-climb from the available simulator cues.Although previous research has shown that estimates of rate-of-climb improve with addition of platform motion," a variety of visual cues from the simulated scene predominate in the determination of speed, or here, rate-of-climb.Two of the most studied cues are visual flow rate and visual edge rate.13-17Visualflow rate is the angular rate that an object moves in the visual scene.It is proportional to speed and inversely proportional to the distance from the contour or object.The number of contours or objects that pass by in a given time measures visual edge rate.It is also proportional to speed, but it is inversely proportional to the object's size.Studies have shown that some people inappropriately use edge rate when flow rate would be more appropriate,13 some are more sensitive to one or the other,14 some adapt over time," and that the ability to switch between the two may not be consciously possible but may depend on unconscious perceptual ~kil1s.l~The studies agree that both cues contribute towards speed and
Figure 3 -3Figure 3 -Vertical motion criterion Summarizing the above previous visual and motion efforts, pilots use rate-of-climb to control altitude.Many different visual cues contribute towards their rate-of-climb estimate.Visual edge rate, which is directly proportional to spatial frequency, is an easily manipulated visual cue and seems to provide profound effects on velocity perception.Platform motion criteria have received considerable attention, but without systematically varying the visual cues.This experiment manipulated visual spatial frequency to determine ifit affects the validity of a previous vertical motion criterion.Exueriment Descriution Simulator S ubsvstems Vehicle Math Model.The model was intentionally simplified to have only a vertical degree-of-freedom.This allowed pilots to focus on the vertical cues.The rate-ofclimb transfer function was:
Figure 9 -9Figure 9 -Visual scene with background Each of the five pilots evaluated the above four factors, which combine to give 36 configurations (2 motion filter gains x 3 motion filter natural frequencies x 3 spatial frequencies x 2 backgrounds).The configurations were randomized and unknown to the pilots.
Figure11, shows that the presence of a visual background also influenced tracking error (p=O.O17).Although having the stripes span the entire field-of-view provided extremely precise altitude and altitude rate information, pilots performed slightly worse overall without the background versus with it.AlthoughRef.13   showed that perceived speed becomes slower as the stimulus field becomes larger, more than just stimulus field size varied here.As discussed earlier, pilots also received additional altitude and speed cues from having the natural background.In addition, the presence of the horizon line always showing the pilot's height relative to

natural frequency affected this measure, as shown in Fig.19(p=O.O23).Less of a tendency for a pilot induced oscillation occurred for a motion filter natural frequency of 0.00 than for either 0.52 or 0.89 rad/sec.Platform motion has previously been shown to affect PI0 ratings.26Here, poorer motion made the configurations more PI0 pronefilter nat.freq., rad/sec Figure19-Effect of motion filter w,, on pilot induced oscillation rating
