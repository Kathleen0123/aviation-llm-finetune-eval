ceiling and poor visibility can also reduce airport capacities significantly.Reduction in airport capacity may induce delays among flights.Typically, under reduced capacity conditions at an airport, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implements a Ground Delay Program (GDP), in which certain flights are assigned pre-departure delays (or ground delays) at their respective origin airports.This is done to mitigate the demand-capacity imbalance at the destination airport caused by weather.If weather conditions become more severe than anticipated, some aircraft may also face airborne delay while is en-route to the destination airport.Airborne delay, although quite common in the National Airspace System (NAS) during adverse weather conditions, is undesired mainly due to expensive fuel consumption and safety issues related to controlling aircraft and maintaining separation standards while they are airborne.This has motivated researchers, since late 80's, to develop optimization models and algorithms to decide on the amount of ground delays that must be imposed on various flights when there is capacity shortfall at one or more airports.The problem of assigning ground delays to various flights subject to the airport capacity constraints in order to minimize an objective function, which is typically the sum of ground and airborne delays, weighted by their relative costs, is known as the ground holding problem (see Odoni (1987) for a systematic description of the ground holding problem).Within the domain of the ground holding problem, there are two sub-problems: the single airport ground holding problem (SAGHP) and the multi-airport ground holding problem (MAGHP).In the SAGHP, the problem is solved for one destination airport at a time.In the MAGHP, a network of airports is considered, so that delay on a given flight segment can propagate to downline segments flown by the same aircraft.In this paper, we will focus on the SAGHP.As theoretical research on ground holding problems has progressed, air traffic flow management has evolved from a completely centralized system to one in which users have more autonomy about how to adapt their schedules when adverse conditions reduce airport capacity.At the first stage of implementing a GDP, the FAA allocates arrival slots to airlines based on their original flight schedules and the first-come/first-served principle, commonly known as the ration-by-schedule (RBS) allocation.To counter uncertainty in airport capacity during future time intervals, which may change depending on how the weather materializes, the FAA might also exempt certain flights, which originate from airports that are located beyond certain geographical distance from the destination, from the GDP.The exempt flights are allowed to arrive at their scheduled times.After the initial round of slot allocations, airlines are allowed to perform substitutions among the slots they have been assigned in order to reduce their internal costs and achieve their business objectives.Airlines may also cancel some of their flights and utilize the vacant slots by substituting some other flights they own and operate.However, in certain circumstances, an airline may not be able to substitute one of its flights to such a slot, maybe because the time stamp associated with the slot is too early for substituting any flight.Therefore, after a round of intra-airline substitutions, it is possible that some arrival slots remain open.The FAA then runs the Compression Algorithm to re allocate arrival slots among flights that are not cancelled.The basic principle behind this algorithm is that whenever possible a delayed flight is assigned an earlier arrival slot, so that the unused capacity during any time period is reduced (or eliminated if possible).While reallocating a flight to an open slot, preference is given to flights that belong to the airline which has released the slot.Such collaborative planning of ground delay programs has resulted from adopting the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) philosophy in the air traffic flow management world since mid 90's (see Hoffman 1997, andVossen 2002 for detailed discussion on CDM and its implications on planning GDPs in real world).In this paper, we present models that will enable collaborative decision making while planning GDPs in face of uncertainty in airport capacity.We first describe two recently developed stochastic optimization models for the SAGHP.The first is a static model, which means ground delay decisions are made once at the beginning of planning horizon and not updated later.In the second model, decisions are dynamically revised based on updated information on airport capacity.We then present a methodology which will allow collaborative planning of ground delay programs in face of uncertainty using these stochastic SAGHP models.We describe how the FAA can use these models to do initial slot allocation to airlines, who can then perform intra-airline substitutions and cancellations.
BACKGROUNDIn a deterministic setting, where the airport capacities during future time intervals are known in advance with perfect information, the SAGHP can be formulated as a minimum-cost network flow problem (Terrab and Odoni, 1993); although, there are certain variants of the deterministic SAGHP that are computationally harder (Hoffman and Ball 2000).In reality, however, weather forecasts are rarely perfectly accurate.In a stochastic setting, where airport capacities in future time intervals are uncertain, the formulation of the SAGHP becomes complex.There is a moderate amount of literature on stochastic optimization models for the SAGHP.In most of the models, the objective is to minimize the expected total cost of delay.The optimization models are of two types: static stochastic, and dynamic stochastic.Static (or single stage) stochastic models account for uncertainty, but do not utilize updated information on the evolution of airport capacity, while the dynamic model accounts for the ability to re assign ground delays depending on what weather conditions unfold.Richetta and Odoni (1993) first proposed an integer programming model to solve the multiperiod static stochastic SAGHP.In their model, uncertainty in airport capacity is represented by a finite set of scenarios, each of which represents a time-varying profile of the airport capacity that is likely to occur.Recently, Kotnyek and Richetta (2006) showed that when the ground holding costs are marginally increasing the dual of the Richetta and Odoni (1993) model becomes a minimum cost network flow problem in formulation, and hence integer solutions are guaranteed to obtain by solving the LP relaxation of the model.Ball et al. (2003)  Quite frequently, in practice, traffic managers make adjustments to a ground delay program to compensate for unanticipated change in airport capacity.This served as a motivation behind the development of dynamic stochastic models for the SAGHP, which are capable of revising ground delay decisions based on evolving forecasts.Richetta and Odoni (1994) formulated a (partially) dynamic multi-stage stochastic IP model.Rather than assigning delays to all flights at once, the Richetta-Odoni model assigns delay as the scheduled departure time approaches, so that decisions can be made with the most up-to-date forecast information.Uncertainty in airport arrival capacities is represented through a finite number of scenarios arranged in a probabilistic binary decision tree.As the day progresses, branches of the tree are realized, resulting in better information about future capacities.In Richetta-Odoni model, however, ground delays, once assigned, cannot be revised, even though this is technically possible so long as the flight has not yet departed.More recently, Mukherjee and Hansen (2003) developed a dynamic multi-stage stochastic IP formulation for the SAGHP, in which ground delays assigned to various flights can be revised during different decision stages, based on updated information on airport operating conditions.An additional advantage of the Mukherjee-Hansen model is that it can handle a wide range of linear and non-linear cost functions in the objective.For example, in addition to the standard linear delay cost function with different weights for airborne and ground delay, we can minimize expected squared arrival delay against schedule, and expected squared deviation between the assigned arrival slot and the ideal RBS arrival slot.Multiple objective functions can also be considered through weighting schemes that either balance different objectives or introduce subsidiary objectives as "tie-breakers" when the original model has multiple optima.In all the stochastic SAGHP models discussed above, uncertainty in airport conditions is captured through a finite set of scenarios, each representing a possible evolution of the timevarying profile of the airport capacity.The dynamic models require more than just the set of capacity scenarios and their unconditional probabilities.In both Richett-Odoni (1994) and Mukherjee-Hansen (2003) models, a probabilistic scenario tree is required, whose branching reveals updated information on the evolving conditions.Recently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a methodology for constructing capacity scenarios, using statistical clustering techniques, and scenario trees from the recorded data on airport acceptance rates.Figure 1 below shows six possible capacity profiles, each of which is likely to occur at San Francisco Intl.airport (SFO) on any given day.Figure 2 shows the corresponding scenario tree, who branching points reveal which scenario or a set of scenarios are likely to prevail.
STOCHASTIC MODELS FOR THE SAGHPIn this section we review the two recently developed stochastic models for the SAGHP: (1)the Ball et al. (2003) static model, and (2) the Mukherjee and Hansen (2003) dynamic model.We first present the formulations and then compare the solutions obtain by applying these models for a realistic problem.3.1.The Ball et al. (2003) Static Stochastic Model for the SAGHP As in most of the discrete optimization models, the planning horizon is divided into T equal time-periods.Let there be Q capacity scenarios, each scenario depicting a possible evolution of airport arrival capacity over the planning period with the scenario q(q = ],2,...,Q) having a probability of occurrence equal to pq.Let M? denote the capacity at time period / under the scenario q.In order to ensure that all flights that are scheduled to land do get assigned to land during a time period, let there be a time period 7" + l with unlimited capacity under all scenarios.Let N, be the number of flights scheduled to arrive during time interval t{( = 1,2,...,T + l).The PAARs are the decision variables, and are denoted by A, (t = 1,..., T +1).Let G, denote the number of flights that are delayed on ground from time period t to / + 1.If the numbers of aircraft that arrive at the terminal airspace exceed airport capacity, certain flight might face airborne holding.Let W{q denote the number of aircraft that are unable to land during time period / under scenario q, and hence faces airborne holding during that time period.Let A. denote the cost ratio between unit airborne and ground delay of any flight.The objective function and the set of constraints are defined as follows:Min. Zf=1G, + I^,^lf=1/l^ (1)s.t. GT+l=O) (2) ^ {! W«+]=0)(3)A,,Gt, W,q > 0 and integer (4)The objective function minimizes the weighted sum of expected ground and airborne delays.Constraint set (2) is required for flow conservation, whereas constraints (3) ensures that the number of aircraft that actually land during any time interval under a scenario do not exceedCorresponding to the variables X%t is a set of corresponding auxiliary variables for the departure time period, defined as follows:{1 if flight f is released for departure by the end of time period t under scenario q; 0 hi 0 otherwiseThe departure release variables track the planned arrival times but are displaced earlier in time by the amount aj-df.Hence the variables y}j are related to X}j as follows:[l otherwiseThe objective function and the set of constraints are given as follows:Min q=\ f I T (t-Arrf)[xyXyt_^xlw) € <D t = Arrr v J J J t = 1(6) s.t:(7)(8)(9)As in most of the models for SAGHP, the objective function minimizes the expected total delay cost.Constraint set (7) ensures that the decision variables X%t are non-decreasing.Constraints (8) are similar to constraints (3) described above.Constraints (9) are the set of "coupling" constraints, sometimes known as non-anticipatory constraints in the literature (see Birge and Louveaus, 1997), on the ground-holding decision variables Y%t.These constraints force ground delay decisions to be made solely on information available at time /.For a given time period /, it is required that the ground holding decisions are the same for all scenarios associated with the same scenario tree branch b (in other words the scenarios belonging to the set Clb) in that time period.When weather clears, the capacity of the airport rises to its visual-flight-rule value, which is 135 arrivals/hour.Figure 3 shows the capacity profiles for the six capacity scenarios q = 1,..6.The scenario probabilities are assumed as follows: pq = (0.4,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1).Table 1 shows the expected ground and airborne delays and the total delay costs that are obtained when the Ball et al. (2003) static and the Mukherjee and Hansen (2003) dynamic models are applied, under two different cost ratios X = 3 and X = 25, to the above problem.When the cost ratio is relatively low -i.e.X = 3 --airborne holding is faced in both models.Such dynamic revision capability is absent in the static model, which faces about 42% more total delay cost compared to the dynamic model.
COLLABORATIVE GDP PLANNING UNDER UNCERTAINTYThe stochastic models described above can be used as decision support tools to plan ground delay programs in face of uncertainty.However, in order to implement them in practice, it is necessary to provide a methodology which will allow the airlines to make intra-airlinc substitutions after the FAA assigns slots to them using the solutions from either model.In this section, we discuss how the Ball et al. (2003) static and the Mukherjee-Hansen (2003) dynamic stochastic models for the SAGHP can be used to plan GDPs while allowing collaborative decision making involving the users (the airlines) and the controlling entity (the FAA).The collaborative GDP planning using the Ball et al. (2003) static model is described through Figure 4 below.As mentioned before, the Ball et al. model produces the optimal set of "planned airport acceptance rates" (PAARs).The FAA can use these numbers to assign slots to the airlines using any rationing scheme of their choice.For example, geographical exemptions followed by ration-by-schedule algorithm can be used for the initial slot allocation.Airlines can then perform substitutions and cancellations, and provide their updated schedules/flight-plans to the FAA, who can then run the Compression algorithm to re-allocate slots among airlines while utilizing the vacant slots created by some of the cancelled flights.An important property of the Ball et al. model is that its objective function remains invariant under intra-airline substitution.As time progresses, updated information on capacity and demand becomes available, and the whole process can be re-executed in order to be adaptive to the evolving conditions.The solution to the Mukherjee-Hansen (2003) model, although assigning slots to flights, may in practice be used as a means of allocating slots to airlines.The arrival slots are however, contingent upon which scenario (or a bundle of scenarios) is realized at the time a flight is released.The planned arrival time of a flight / e O under a scenario q is given by the expression £ t(Xi, -X%t_^).We denote this value by 0j.Therefore for each flight, the t=af model solves for an optimal portfolio of scenario contingent arrival times.For any given flight and a portfolio of scenario contingent arrival time periods (or slots) it is possible to perform a feasibility check of assigning the portfolio of slots to the flight.Feasibility depends on the fight's scheduled departure time and the coupling constraints given by expression (9).Definition 1: The assignment of flight f to the portfolio of scenario-contingent arrival time periodsrq,qe{1,..,Q) is feasible, iff Tq>aj-, and the variables Yjt>df satisfy the coupling constraints (9) defined in Section 3.2.Any substitution involving two flights requires swapping the scenario specific arrival slots between them.Therefore, for the substitution to occur, each flight must be assigned a new portfolio of slots that was owned by the other flight.Definition 2: A substitution of scenario contingent slots between any two flights /, and f2 is allowed if 0? (q e {1,.., Q)) is a feasible assignment for f2, and 6% is feasible for fx.Scenario based substitution interchanges arrival time periods between two flights under different scenarios, and therefore doesn't affect the arrivals (and hence ground delays) of other flights that are not involved in the substitutions.Also, the scenario-specific ground delays are not affected by a substitution of scenario-contingent arrival times between two flights.This is proved in the following proposition.Proposition 1: A scenario contingent slot substitution between two flights does not change the total ground delays under different scenarios.Proof: Let /, and /2 be two flights involved in substitution.Let scenario-specific ground delays of any flight /e<D before substitution be denoted by g%,q e{\,~Q) ■ After substitution, the scenario-specific ground delays of flight /eO\{/|,/2) remains unchanged.For flights f\ and fa the ground delays after substitution are given by g%+6% -6% and g|+#?-#? respectively.Therefore the scenario-specific total ground delays of the two flights involved in the substitution remains unchanged.The proof follows.Proposition 2: Scenario-specific planned arrival rates during any time period t e {1,.., T +1} remain unchanged after substitutions.Proof: Let /j and /2 be two flights involved in a substitution.Scenario-specific arrival time periods of flights /eO\{/j,/2} -i.e.X%t -remain unchanged after substitution.Therefore for time periods te{l,..,T + l}\{0i [}$% } scenario-specific planned arrival numbers remains unchanged.Before substitution the expression (X% t~X%.,) attains a value 1 for / = 6% and 0 otherwise.Similarly before substitution (Xj f -Xqf M) = 1 iff t = 0j .After substitution, (XJ f -Xqf M) = 1 iff / = 0J.and(X% -Xi]) = l iff t = 9l .Therefore during time periods t&{6% \J6% }, the scenario specific planned arrivals after substitution remains same as that before.Q.E.D.Corollary I: Scenario-specific airborne delays remain same after substitution.Proof: From proposition 2, during any time period, the number of planned arrivals -(jfy-,-Xy-,_])~ remains the same before and after substitution.Therefore, it is easy to see, from expression (8), that the time-varying airborne queueing delay -Wtq -remains unchanged.Corollary 2: The value of the objective function of the Mukherjee-Hansen model, given in expression (6), remains invariant to a feasible substitution.Proof.The proof follows from Proposition 1 and Corollary 1.The above discussion focused on scenario-contingent slot substitution between two flights at a time.However, an airline may want to perform substitutions involving multiple flights.For example, a flight /j may be substituted for fa under a particular scenario, and for f$ under a different scenario.Furthermore, an airline may cancel some of its flights and utilize the vacant slots to reduce delays of some of its other flights.From the solutions to the Mukherjee-Hansen model it is possible to determine the scenario-specific numbers of slots -v1t -assigned to each an airline a e A during a time interval t, where A is the set of airlines.The FAA allocates these scenario-contingent slots to airlines.The airlines can then assign a ground delay cost function to individual flights they own, and re-allocate slots among flights.This is similar to present day substitutions performed in a ground delay program.However, in order to preserve feasibility, airlines must abide by the coupling constraints, given by expression (9), while performing substitutions.Moreover, they must not re-assign more than v|, number of flights during time period t under scenario q.In order to show the benefits of allowing intra-airline substitutions we perform an experiment using the same dataset described in Section 3.3, and assuming the ground delay cost of each flight to be uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 1.5.The flight-specific unit costs reflect differences in operating cost, payload, fare, class mix, downstream connectivity, and other factors that may cause an airline to attach higher or lower priority to certain flights.The cost ratio between airborne and ground holding -k -is set to 25; i.e. there is no airborne holding in the solution of the Mukherjee-Hansen model.Substitutions are performed, for 100 different realizations of ground delay cost for each flight, to minimize airlines-specific total ground delay cost.Figure 5 below presents the box-and-whisker plot summarizing delay cost reduction, by airline, after substitutions.Airlines that operate larger numbers of flights, such as AAL, benefit more from substitutions.This is intuitive, because an airline with a larger set of flights has more substitution opportunities.After a round of cancellations and intra-airline substitutions, airlines submit their revised slot assignment to the FAA.Due to cancellations, there may be some slots that remain un utilized.This can happen if an airline is unable to substitute one of its own flights to a slot that is vacated by a flight that the airline has decided to cancel.Furthermore, the updated information may become available on evolving conditions -i.e.scenario tree branching -in the time that is taken by the entire process of intra-airline substitution.The Mukherjee-Hansen model can then be re-run with updated information on both fronts -capacity and demand.This will allow re-assigning some flights to the vacant slots created by cancellations.A slight modification to the objective function, by assigning airline-specific weights that are proportional to the number of flights cancelled by different airlines, may produce solutions that are analogous to the present-day Compression algorithm which gives priority to an airline that has cancelled a flight while performing slot re-assignments.one in which ground delays decisions are adaptive to the information on evolving airport capacity condition.In order to use these models in practice, it is necessary to allow airlines to participate in the planning process and perform substitutions that improve their internal objectives.In this paper we show how the solutions obtained from the stochastic models for the SAGHP can be used under the CDM paradigm.The Ball et al. (2003) static stochastic model for the SAGHP produces the optimum set of PAARs that can be used by the FAA to set the airport acceptance rates when a GDP is implemented.Thereafter, an equitable slot allocation mechanism may be adopted to assign arrival slots to airlines, who can then perform substitutions and cancellations.After a round of intra-airline slot re-allocation, the FAA can run the Compression algorithm in order to utilize vacant slots that may have been created by cancellations.Thus, the Ball et al. model produces solutions that are easily adoptable in the current system.Their model, although formulated as an integer programming model, can be solved as an LP because the constraint matrix is totally unimodular.This eases the computation time, and thus making the model applicable in real time.The Mukherjee-Hansen (2003) model, on the other hand, assigns scenario-contingent slots to individual flights.This however, does not restrict airlines to perform substitutions and cancellations.The solution to the Mukherjee-Hansen, although assigning slots to flights, may in practice be used as a means of allocating slots to airlines.Airlines can then perform substitutions among their flights while abiding by certain constraints discussed in this paper.Our experimental results show significant benefit, in terms of delay cost reduction, to airlines from this process.Both models require as input the information on capacity scenarios and their probabilities.The Mukherjee-Hansen dynamic model also requires a probabilistic scenarios tree whose branching reveals unfolding conditions at the airport.Constructing capacity scenarios and scenario trees pose a challenge to the implementation of these models in practice.Recent work by Liu et al. (2006) shed some light in this direction.The research on stochastic models for the SAGHP, integrated with that on developing capacity scenarios and scenario tree, may lead to an efficient decision support tool in planning ground delay programs in face of uncertainty in the future.= 1 q = l q = 3 g-4 q = 5 q = 6 0:00 8:00 8:30 9:00 9:30 10:00 10:30 12:00 Time of Day3. 3 .3Static vs. Dynamic SAGHPWe apply the above models -theMukherjee and Hansen (2003) and theBall et al. (2003) to a realistic problem, and compare the solutions.The FAA -ASPM1 database was use to obtain flight schedules at the Dallas Fort Worth Intl.airport (DFW) on a summer weekday of 2003.A hypothetical ground holding problem was constructed, described as follows.It is assumed that weather impacts the airport capacity by reducing it to 60 arrival operations per hour during the morning hours.There are six capacity scenarios, each corresponding to a possible weather clearance time between 8:00AM and 10:30AM in 30 minutes increment.
The static model assigns relatively low ground delay compared to the dynamic model and releases some flights placing a bet on the capacity to improve.The dynamic model on the 1 www.apo.data.faa.gov/other hand adopts a "wait-and-see" policy and assigns relatively more ground holding initially.If capacity improves, ground delays are revised and flights are released earlier, otherwise, ground delays are extended The adaptive policy of assigning ground delays leads to less risk of facing airborne holding in the dynamic model.When the cost ratio is high -i.e.X = 25 -both models adopt a conservative ground holding policy.The dynamic model achieves lower expected ground delays by virtue of releasing flights if conditions improve.
Figure 5 also shows the variation in cost reduction for the 100 different realizations of flight-specific ground delay unit cost.The upper and lower edge of each box represents the upper and lower quartiles respectively, while the diamond depicts the two standard deviation interval around the mean.There is considerable variability in cost reduction for certain airlines such as DAL and CHQ.In the former case, the explanation is that one DAL flight was assigned delay by the DRGH model.Depending on the cost reduction, this flight is substituted with another flight with lower unit delay cost in the substitution phase.
we describe two recently developed stochastic optimization models for the single airport ground holding problem, and present a methodology on how these models can be used to plan ground delay programs in face of uncertainty in airport capacity.The first model -the Ball et al. (2003) model --is static stochastic, which means the ground delay decisions are made once and are not revised based on updated information on the airport conditions.The second model -the Mukherjee-Hansen (2003) model -is dynamic stochastic

the corresponding airport capacity.The solution to the model yields the optimum values of the decision variables -A, -that reflect the number of aircraft that are planned to arrive, not necessarily land, at the terminal airspace and desire to land during various time intervals.3.2.Mukherjee and Hansen (2003) Dynamic Stochastic Model for the SAGHP Wherever possible, we use the same notations as in the static stochastic model described above.As mentioned before, in addition to the capacity scenarios and their unconditional probabilities, the dynamic model requires as input how the scenario tree unfolds.The following parameters are used to provide the scenario tree information (see Mukherjee, 2004, andLiu et al., 2006 for details).Let B be the total number of branches in the scenario tree; B > Q.Each branch corresponds to a set of scenarios.The n^ scenarios corresponding to branch be{\,..,B} is given by the setQ6 = {Sf,..,s£,..,S* };S% e{l,..,Q}.The time periods corresponding to start and end nodes of branch b are denoted by Of, and/jb;be{\,..,B} .The other input parameters are the set of flights O = {\,...,F}, their scheduled departure and arrival time periods -ay and df respectively, scenario-specific airport capacities M?, <7 = 0> ••>(?}. and the cost ratio between unit airborne and ground delay -X.The decision variables X%t {q e {1,..Q), f e <D,/ e {ay,.., T +1}) are binary, and are defined as follows:(1 if flight f is planned to arrive by the end of time period t under scenario q;
