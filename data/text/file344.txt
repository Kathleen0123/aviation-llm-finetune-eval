IntroductionNASA's UAS Traffic Management (UTM) Project has been tasked with research and development of technologies and requirements for a small UAS traffic management system.This system is designed to support small UAS operations in low altitude airspace, complementing the FAA's Air Traffic Management system [1,2].The UTM Project planned a phased approach in four Technical Capability Levels (TCL) to accomplish the task.In TCL1, completed in 2015, Visual Line-of-Sight (VLOS) operations such as agriculture, firefighting, and infrastructure monitoring were addressed with a focus on geofencing and operations scheduling.Technologies and requirements for Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLOS) operations in sparsely populated areas were examined in TCL2 in 2016, and for operations over moderately populated areas in TCL3 in 2017 and 2018.TCL4 built on the earlier TCLs and focused on BVLOS operations in higher-density urban areas for tasks such as newsgathering and package delivery, and for managing large-scale contingencies [3~6].The TCL4 demonstration in 2019 was a set of scenario-driven activities that integrated the UTM project objectives.Several scenarios were created focusing on different challenges associated with operations in a potential operational TCL4 environment, such as persistent, mixed tempo, and high-density BVLOS operations over an urban area.A total of 144 live operations were flown from June 18th to June 28th in the Reno, Nevada flight test range for some of the scenarios with nine Unmanned Aircraft (UA) made by three manufacturers.These included one vehicle from AirRobot GmbH & Co. KG, five from Drone America, and three from SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.Five UAS Service Suppliers (USS) developed by AirMap Inc., AiRXOS (a GE venture), ANRA Technologies, Avision Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc. supported the operations.A total of 208 operations were flown from August 12th to August 16th, and August 19th to August 23rd in the Corpus Christi, Texas range for all scenarios with nine UA made by two manufacturers, including two from 3DR and seven from SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.Seven USS developed by AirMap Inc., AiRXOS (a GE venture), ANRA Technologies, Avision Inc., Collins Aerospace (a unit of United Technologies Corp.), OneSky (Analytical Graphics, Inc.), and Uber Technologies Inc. supported the operations.For all operations, arrangements were made to allow only demonstration participants in the defined range.Extended VLOS operations were used to emulate BVLOS operations.That is, the UA was in sight of designated visual observers when the operator was unable to see it due to obstruction (e.g., UA behind a building) or distance, and the observers and the operator maintained a line of communication among them to keep track of the operation.Details of the TCL4 demonstration are in reference [7].A small UAS off-nominal situation reporting system developed in the UTM project was implemented by the participating USSs for the TCL4 demonstration.This system was designed to capture information from off-nominal situations to understand their nature and reduce occurrences.To test this reporting system, scripted Communications and Navigation (C&N) offnominal events, such as loss of Command and Control (C2) communication and degraded navigation performance, were included in the demonstration.Operators participating in such events were directed to act as if their operation had encountered the scripted off-nominal situation and resolve the situation.The occurrence of actual (i.e., unscripted) off-nominal situations was anticipated and the operators were directed to prioritize safe resolution of the situation over scenario participation.When either scripted or actual off-nominal situations occurred, operators were required to submit an off-nominal report including a narrative of the situation to their supporting USS upon resolution of the situation.When the airborne operation became nonconforming or rogue, the report submission was required as well.A total of 116 reports were collected by USSs.This TM describes the TCL4 off-nominal situation reporting system implementation and analysis of 45 unique cases identified from the reports.Off-nominal situations data including the reporter narrative for the 45 cases are provided in the Appendix.The TM ends with suggestions for the future off-nominal reporting process.
Off-nominal Reporting Setup for the TCL4 Demonstration
Reporting scripted off-nominal operational situationIn each of the TCL4 demonstration scenarios, one or more scripted C&N off-nominal events were featured.Events are changes to the operations, environment, and/or conditions that elicit a response from the small UAS Operator, USS, and/or UA.In particular, there are four events designed to test C&N off-nominal operational situations, on a small or large scale.Table 1 describes these events.
Table 1. Communications and Navigation Off-nominal Event

Name of the EventDescription Test Event 10Small-Scale Loss of C2 LinkIn this event at least one but not more than 25% of UA in a scenario encounters a loss of C2 Link condition at a specific time, individualized for each encounter.Each affected UA must initiate mitigation steps.
Test Event 11Large-Scale Loss of C2 LinkIn this event at least 90% of UA in a scenario encounters a loss of C2 Link condition at a specific time and all affected UA must initiate mitigation steps.
Test Event 12Small-Scale
Loss of NavigationIn this event at least one but not more than 25% of UA in a scenario encounters a degraded navigation performance condition at a specific time, individualized for each encounter.Each affected UA must initiate mitigation steps.
Test Event 13Large-Scale
Loss of NavigationIn this event at least 90% of UA in a scenario encounters a degraded navigation performance condition at a specific time and all affected UA must initiate mitigation steps.The operator who participated in a scripted C&N off-nominal event was required to submit an offnominal report once the operation closed.To facilitate this submission process, USS implemented a feature to prompt the operator to file an off-nominal report when the following conditions occurred during an operation.These conditions are associated with operation states maintained by USS, shown in Fig. 1.Additional information about the states is in the USS specification [8].USS developers were given the freedom to choose the reporting interface and prompting method as they saw fit.For example, two options were prompting operators by handing out a stand-alone device with an online survey form to the operator or opening a dialog window on the USS interface display showing a report form.A sample off-nominal reporting form provided by NASA is shown in Fig. 2.
Reporting unscripted off-nominal operational situationIn the TCL4 demonstration, the director of flight operations at the flight test range communicated with the operator, visual observers, and range safety personnel to manage unscripted (i.e., actual) off-nominal situations.Public safety officers provided support when needed.When the operation encountered an off-nominal situation, the operator informed the director about the situation (e.g., "Communications with UA is lost").The director assessed the risk posed to the public by checking with the visual observers and the range safety personnel.When a risk was identified, all airborne operations were directed to land or loiter and planned operations were halted, depending on the nature of the risk.If no risk was identified or the risk was sufficiently mitigated, the operator was directed to return to the demonstration in progress upon the safe resolution of the situation.The operator was required to submit an off-nominal report before starting a new operation.
Off-nominal Data ModelNASA provided a data model to USS implementers for submission of off-nominal reports to NASA, after the removal of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).The data model in YAML 1 format is provided as follows.The fully expanded off-nominal data model and associated models are publicly available on GitHub [9].

TCL4 Off-nominal Reports Analysis
Experiential ReportsExperiential incident reports were collected as part of the TCL4 UTM flight test initiative conducted at the Nevada and Texas test sites between June and August 2019.There were 118 initial experiential reports in the data set, of which 72 were from the Nevada test site, and 46 from the Texas test site.Of the 46 Texas reports, 2 were determined to be duplicate reports2 , and were therefore removed from the data set.In summary, there were 116 unique reports in the data set -72 describing events at the Nevada test site, and 44 from the Texas test site.All available unique reports were screened and provided initial evaluation and classification for relevance and quality of narrative information.This evaluation and classification process is known as coding in aviation safety taxonomy.Of the 116 unique reports, 71 reports contained no, or insufficient narrative data to support analysis 3 ,and 45, termed "Qualified Reports" were determined to contain sufficient qualitative narrative data to perform coding and analysis.
Event TypesInitially, a team of UTM researchers created a list of off-nominal event types to describe potential events in TCL4 flight testing.This list was derived from observations from previous UTM flight testing:• Exit lateral or vertical geofence However, these previously derived event descriptions were not readily matched to narrative information contained in individual reports in the data set.Therefore, a more appropriate set of event descriptions for the TCL4 data set was developed.The events descriptions and count of the events from the TCL4 test are shown in Table 2.The descriptions are applicable to the TCL4 flight test and should not be taken as a comprehensive set for UA operations in general.
Event Type DiscussionTable 2 shows nine categories to capture 45 unique events.Following associates each category with information derived from report review.
C2 simulated loss (19 of 45 reports)Nevada conducted a simulation of loss of overall Command and Control (C2).Overall, the results were positive, with operators landing their vehicles in place, at an alternate landing site, or returning to the launch site as appropriate.Many were landed "outside of the operational volume," but that would be considered acceptable in emergency or urgent circumstances.Non-conformance with Flight Plan and/or USS requirements (7 of 45 reports) In 7 incidents, operators did not or were unable to complete the programmed flight plan or were not in conformance with USS flight path and/or airspace (volume) requirements.One reporter noted that "USS does not have a means to schedule position holds.",indicating that the USS could not dynamically update the flight plan to keep the operation in conformance.Ground flight control equipment issues (6 of 45 reports) iPad control issues, such as disconnection, or program failure were commonly noted in these reports.
C2 Loss or interruption (5 of 45 reports)Several reports noted loss of communication.Two reports noted communication loss when line of sight data connection was interrupted by terrain or obstacles.
Track or heading deviation (3 of 45 reports)In each of these reports, the reported deviation was minimal and crew were able to correct the deviation.In one event, the reported track deviation was only 3 to 5 feet.
Navigation simulated loss (2 of 45 reports)Of the two loss of navigation reports, one reporter noted "Simulated event -loss of navigation.Landed on Cal Neva rooftop.In real nav loss, the aircraft would not be able to navigate to a safe LZ."Of the remaining 3 events, 1 involved a potential conflict with a manned aircraft.The manned aircraft event, in which the UA did not respond as planned or directed, had a 900-foot vertical separation.Therefore, a Near Mid-air Collision (NMAC), defined as less than 500 feet vertical and 0.5 nautical miles lateral, did not occur.
Suggestions for the Future small UAS Off-nominal Reporting ProcessDuring the TCLs 1 to 4, the UTM project explored different options to capture off-nominal reports from the UTM-participating operations, such as running a web-form server at NASA and using a commercial online survey service.From this exploration, submission via a USS was identified as the best approach for providing a reporting interface to the operator and collecting the report.Therefore, the following requirements were included in the USS specification [8], the baseline requirements for providing UAS Services within the UTM.There is an expectation that future, operational USSs will collect off-nominal reports.When an operation enters an off-nominal condition (which would include all NONCONFORMING and ROGUE operations), additional reporting will be necessary.For more discussion and definitions for off-nominal conditions, see [UTM-OffNominal].[UTM-USS-076] A USS MUST obtain an off-nominal situation report from the operator for each ROGUE operation.[UTM-USS-077] A USS MUST obtain an off-nominal situation report from the operator for each operation that has an unplanned return to the launch location.[UTM-USS-078] A USS MUST obtain an off-nominal situation report from the operator for each operation that has an unplanned landing.[UTM-USS-079] A USS MUST obtain an off-nominal situation report from the operator for each operation that enters an unplanned loiter.The definition of "unplanned" in the previous requirements relates to the active operation plan at the time of the landing or at the time of the loiter.It is quite possible in these cases that the operation goes ROGUE in the process of such a landing or loiter, but this is not necessarily the case.Thus, the separate requirements are needed.The separate requirements for unplanned landing ([UTM-USS-078]) and unplanned return to launch location ([UTM-USS-077]) stem from the way in which those landings may occur.For example manual versus automated or controlled versus uncontrolled.Through further discussion with stakeholders, these requirements may be refined and potentially collapsed or further expanded.[UTM-USS-080] A USS MUST obtain an off-nominal situation report from the operator for each operation results in the loss of the UA.The "loss of the UA" means either• a total loss of the vehicle due to a crash or hard landing, or • a vehicle that is unrecoverable due to its known or unknown landing location.[UTM-USS-081] Whenever a USS is required to obtain an off-nominal situation report from an operator, the USS MUST do so within 3 days of the operation completion.[UTM-USS-082] A USS MUST obtain data from the operator's platform per a Data Management Plan.Formatting of off-nominal situation reports will be codified in the future and may allow for reporting multiple events in a single form, but currently the expectation is that for each requirement that is met above for an operation, there will be a unique off-nominal situation.So an operation that goes NONCONFORMING twice would submit two reports.An operation that suddenly loiters and then later in the operation goes NONCONFORMING would need to file two off-nominal situation reports.Again, this process will be developed further in the future to streamline as much as possible without losing potentially vital airspace safety information.Data management plan details will be published in a separate document in the future.For the TCL4 demonstration, the USS collected of off-nominal reports were sent to NASA and UTM project personnel performed evaluation and analysis.Given the scheduled closing of the NASA UTM project in FY 2020, it is suggested that in the future USSs should collect and submit off-nominal situation reports to the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) [10] so that evaluation and analysis continues to understand off-nominal situations and reduce their occurrences.This reporting should be understood as an additional process to the FAA reporting requirements.For example, operations under the Federal Aviation Regulations Part 107 are required to submit Part 107 Accident Reporting Form 4 to report an accident.The ASRS gathers incident reports from pilots, air traffic controllers, dispatchers, cabin crew, maintenance technicians and others via four electronic reporting forms, General, ATC, Maintenance, and Cabin, and USS can use the first three forms for submitting the small UAS offnominal reports it collected.When USS fills the ASRS form, it is suggested to include data elements that are pertinent to small UAS operation, such as UA autopilot and ground control system information.The TCL4 off-nominal data model [9] should be used as a reference for identifying such elements.
SummaryAs a part of NASA's UTM project, a small UAS off-nominal situation reporting system was developed and implemented to captured information from scripted and actual (i.e., unscripted) off-nominal situations, from 144 small UAS operations in Reno, Nevada and 208 operations in Corpus Christi, Texas.A total of 116 off-nominal situation reports were collected using this reporting system.From these reports, 45 unique cases were identified, and this TM provides the description of the reporting system and analysis of the 45 cases.Given the scheduled closing of the NASA UTM project in FY 2020, it is suggested that in the future small UAS off-nominal situations reports to be sent to the Aviation Safety Reporting System so that evaluation and analysis continue to understand off-nominal situations and reduce their occurrences.
