The essential characteristics of the optimal trajectories and differences between these results and the comparable fixed-wing results are emphasized.Finally, the application of the optimization algorithm and representative optimal trajectories for the S-61N helicopter are shown in section 4.
DEVELOPHENT OF A HELlCOPTER PERFORMANCE MODELIn the development of a performance model for the helicopter, two goals influence our approach.The first goal is to recognize that the primary aim of this effort is to develop an on-line procedure such that operational helicopters with only moderate onboard computational capability can utilize this model to perform on-line trajectory optimization.The second is to ensure that the model is accurate enough over the entire operating envelope of the vehicle so that l!optimal!! trajectories that are computed using this model will not deviate significantly from the "true ll optimal policy.This "t rue" optimal p o is of course unknown and hence it is impossible to check this second attribute directly.Rather~the accuracy of our model is gauged by comparing the predicted performance with the performance values given in the helicopter flight manual (ref.4).To implement the flightpath-optimization algorithm three rmanc e quantities are required.These are;(1) Power for level flight (cruise power).(2) Rate-of-climb and rate-of-descent data.power ava.iLab Le and fuel-flow data.These three items are needed for all velocity and altitudes within the vehicle-flight e nve as weLl.as for the range of weights and engine-power settings.Our trea.tment of each of these items is found in sections.
Cruise Power RequiredThe difficulties of analytically modeling nonaxial flow through a rotor, and accurately accounting for various important effects such as stall, compressibility, etc., make a strictly analytical approach to this problem unreasonable.Yet without some account of the significant effects on required power caused by these items the mathematics of the optimization procedure frequently lead to invalid or nonsensical results.The approach taken in this report is to use only a simple phenomenological model based on momentum and blade element theories.The flight manual data are then fit to this simple model using variable coefficients that are functions of vehicle weight and altitude.We consider the power required for level cruise to be of the form The induced power PI which uses the Glauert approximation is written(2.2)where T is the rotor thrust and Vi is the induced velocity given implicitly by T In our model we use the assumption T::; lv.(2.3)The parasite power represents the power dissipated by fuselage and hub drag and is written: (2.4)The rotor prof ile power, that is, the power dissipated by the rotating blades, is given by the simple blade element expression (ref.These power expressions are quite simplistic and neglect several important terms such as nonuniform rotor inflow, azimuthal variation of drag coefficient, and additional unmodeled power terms such as the tail r o t o r power.The model is qualitatively correct, however, and becomes quite accurate when the coefficients c 1 ' c 2 ' c 3 are obtained by a least-squares fit of this mode I to the flight manual data.Several methods were used to fit a set of coefficients c r' c z, c 3 to the flight data.In one method, labeled "model B," a least-squares fit was obtained for a range of weight and altitude combinations.At each weight-altitude combination, the cruise-power data from the flight handbook was discretized (at 10 knot increments) and the coefficients obtained from the least-square algorithm.The quality of the curve fit was good as observed in figures 2.I(a)-2.l(d).For low weights and altitudes the coefficients ci are close to 1 and behave consistently, indicating that the simple power model expression (2.1) is indeed a good approximation to the data.At high altitudes and weights, the behavior of the coefficients is erratic, indicating difficulty in fitting to the simple model (see figs.2.2(a)-2.2(c».The source of the difficulty can be partially resolved by replotting the estimated coefficients as a function of thrust coefficient cT (cT = W/pV~A) in figures 2.3(a)-2.3(c).At high thrust coefficients (corresponding to high rotor-lift coefficients) the erratic variation in fit coefficients (particularly c, and c,) is an indication that the simple rotor power expression (2.1) is inadequate to model the true power variation with speed.In particular, it is apparent that unmodeled variations with speed in the rotor profile power are being absorbed into the body drag term which has a V' variation.To improve the quality of the model the ad hoc stall and compressibility corrections given by Keys (ref. 7) were included in the least-square algorithms.These corrections did little to improve the consistency of the coefficients and were subsequently omitted.The primary concern in using these data in the power model is the necessity of interpolating between points to obtain data for the intermediate weights and altitudes.The optimization algorithm is sensitive to derivative information; hence, there is conCern about the validity of the trajectories obtained in this case.To improve upon the smoothness of the model an alternate fit technique was applied which a s sume d that for each weight the coefficients c 1 ' c 2 , c 3 were linear functions of altitude.The resultant coefficients are shown in figure 2.2 labeled as "A" t-lodel.This method does indeed improve the smoothness of the fit coefficients; however, the quality of fit, particularly at high weight and altitude, is decreased as seen in figure 2.4.In determining the optimal flightpaths, primary use was made of this smoothed "A" l-lode L, Comparisons of flightpaths computed from the two models are used to indicate the sensitivity of the trajectory generating algorithm to the slight differences in the simplified performance model.Mass density of the air is the primary atmospheric parameter which determines aerodynamic forces (temperature is significant if Mach effects are considered).Consequently, in parameterizing a model based on altitude it is assumed that "density altitude!! is the appropriate definition to use.Since the flight-manual cruise data are presented for the standard atmosphere, the effect of using this model in a nonstandard atmosphere cannot be evaluated at this time.
Propulsive ModelThe S-61N is a dual-turbine-Gngine-powered helicopter using one of two engine models currently available.These are the General Electric CTSS-110 engine having a maximum ccntinuous power (MCP) rating of 1050 SHP and the GE CTSS-140 with an MCP of 1250 SHP per engine.The flight manual contains complete data for both engines; however, in this report the performance wi th the CT58-140 engine is discussed.Engine power available is shown as a function of altitude in figure 2.5 for standard conditions.Performance for off-nominal temperatures is available in the manual but was not used in this report.Engine fuel-flow characteristics corrected for altitude effects are shown in figure 2.6.Note that for this engine the fuel flow is a linear functiou of power at all altitudes.Data are available in the manual only at the two altitudes, sea level and 5000 ft.Using standard engine normalization techniques these data are extrapolated to other conditions by using the "corrected" fuel flow W Fc = WF/618 and the corrected power HP c = HP/6 , where 8 = pIp,.e = T/T o are the pressure and temperature ratios, respectively.This scaling is validated for the current engine by noting that under this transformation the corrected fuel flows for h = sea level and h = 5000 ft coalesce to a single curve.Optimum steady state cruise performance can be established by using the performance models of the previous section in conjunction with the fuel-flow data.The parameter (I-IF/V) (dimensionally the weight of fuel expended per unit distance traveled) is referred to in this report as the \I c r u i s e cost.1f In addition to its importance in conventional quasi-steady performance calculations} this quantity is shown in succeeding sections of this report to be of fundamental importance in determining the structure of the fuel optimal trajectories.For each altitude and weight the minimum fuel cruise cost (WF/V)* = min(WF/V) and the corresponding optimt~cruise V speed V* = arg min(WF/V) are determined.Variations in these quantities for each of V the two performance models of the previous section are shown in figures 2.7 and 2.8.We expect that the minimum cruise cost of the model B is reasonably accurate at each of the match points.The smoothed model (A) agrees very well at the low gross weight (13,000-15,000 Ib) and is a poor fit only for the heavy weights (W = 17,000-19,000 Ib) at the higher altitudes.The large discrepancy at the high altitude for W, := 19~OOO Ib is not of significance since the optimal trajectories do not enter this region.At the intermediate weight, W = 17,000 Ib, the two models predict opposite trends with increasing altitude.In this area the fuel optimal trajectories must be examined carefully to assure that the computed optimal performance is not significantly sensitive to potential modeling errors.The minimization shown in figures 2.7 and 2.8 was done without consideration of the operating limits imposed upon the S-61N.Superimposed with V* on figure 2.8 are the handbook VNE (velocity-never-to-exceed) curves~I t is seen that the unconstrained minimization results in optimal cruise speeds consistently falling outside the VNE curves at the higher altitudes (it should be pointed out tbat handbook cruise data are also frequently outside this boundary).in subsequent trajectory minimizations V NE is used as an upper limit on the allowable speed; hence, the cruise cost shoi\.'Uin figure 2.7 is frequently not achieved.
Climb-Descent CalculationsCru Ls e-cpowe r curves of helicopter in level flight cannot be directly applied to the computation of climb performance, unlike those for the fixed-wing aircraft.The reason is that, in contrast to the fixed-wing aircraft, the helicopter in a climb experiences very little fuselage rotation.Consequently~a vertical velocity component significantly affects the inflow into the rotor; hence, the force and power characteristics may Lcan t between level flight and maximum climb rate, though in a continuous vJay.points out in his report (ref.7) that climb in a helicopter is affected an increase in the of producing thrust~download on the increased transmission losses and increases in tail rotor power, all of which have no in f a i r c raf L Using a technique suggested by Keys (ref. 7) the helicopter climb is simplified by introducing an empirical climb (or descent) factor and writing the climb rate h as (2.6) where ( ) indicates either climb or descent, P A is the rotor-shaft power available, and P R is the level-flight cruise power required.For the climb factor Keys reports typical values as k CLB ~0.70-0.85.The corresponding descent factor kDST ~1.The climb factor for the S-6lN is estimated by comparing the flight manual maximum-rate-of-climb data to the computed maximum-rate-of-climb data using equation (2.6).The factor becomes difficult to assess accurately for very low rates of climb because of inconsistencies between the cruise data and climb data published in the flight manual (ref.4).A summary of the computed climb factors for a number of points is shown in figure 2.9.On the basis of these data a climb factor of 0.75, shown as a dashed line in figure 2.9, is used throughout this report.Limited descent data obtained from single-engine operation data indicate that kDST ~1 is reasonable in the descent phase of the trajectory.The relationship of these factors to the structure of the optimal trajectories is discussed in the next section.In the case of fixed-wing aircraft, potential energy (altitude) and kinetic energy (velocity) are often assumed to be interchangeable and in fact if E = (h + V 2 ) / 2g , then E= (PA -PR)/W is a frequently used performance relation.For the helicopter, it is seen that potential energy changes are complicated by the climb and descent factors.We speculate also that when undergoing velocity changes, an acceleration factor can be introduced, such that The numerical value of such an acceleration factor is needed if a true-energy-type analysis is to be performed.Unfortunately, only little data are available at the present time to allow determination of such a factor.For the performance analysis carried out in the later sections of this report, this problem is circumvented by neglecting kinetic-energy effects on the optimal trajectories.The validity of this assumption is discussed in section 4.
3.FO~~ULATION OF OPTIMAL TRAJECTORY PROBL&3.
Mathematics of OptimizationUsing the helicopter performance model of the previous section, we will examine fixed-range trajectories which optimize some performance index.Typically, we may be interested in minimum fuel or minimum operating cost~but~in genera1 1 we aSsume the problem can be formulated as minimization of an integral of the formJ i t f F dt c (3,la)The optimal trajectory is a determination of the altitude h and range x as functions of time as well as the supplementary variables such as speed, power setting, flightpath angle, etc. such that performance index (3.1a)achieves a minimum value subject to a fixed-range constraint and any additional constraints reflecting operating limits of the vehicle.The problem as posed fits into the framework of a calculus of variations or "optimal control" problem.While necessary conditions for optimality are rather easy to specify (see, e.g., Bryson and Ho (ref.8» numerical computations of the minimizing trajectory can be a difficult and time consuming task involving iterative solutions of a nonlinear two-point boundary-value problem.This problem can be simplified if we assume at the outset an a priori structure for the optimal trajectory.Using the methodology of Erzberger and Lee (ref.9) we assume the trajectory can be split into three distinct segments as shown in figure 3.1.These are:(1) an ascent segment, (2) a constant altitude cruise segment, and (3) a descent segment.The cost integral (3.la) can then be written asO.lb)To further simplify, we assume the energy per unit we.Lgh t ("energy height")0.2)is monotonic on the ascent and descent portions of the trajectories and can be used as an independent variable.In the fixed-wing case used by Erzberger.the energy height satisfies 0.3) where P is the available power from the propulsive system and P R is the power required for equilibrium (constaut energy) flight.Also in (3.3), the acceleration normal to the flightpath is considered small.To extend this concept to a rotarywing vehicle requires certain additional assumptions.First, on a helicopter, the rotor itself can serve as a significant energy storage device.If variable rotor speeds are to be considered then rotor energy should be an additional term in (3.2).For this study a fixed rotor speed, which is consistent with the flight manual performance curves, was usedo Hence, this term is not present" Second, the performance model of the helicopter discussed in section 2 differentiates changes in potential energy (h) and kinetic energy (V 2/2g) by use of the climb, descent, and acceleration factors.This suggests that potential and kinetic energy are not interchangeable on a trajectory as is generally the case with a conventional aircraft.These complications can be suppressed by noting that being an inherently low-speed vehicle, the kinetic-energy term and, in particular, the kinetic-energy changes, are generally fairly small for a that at V ~100 knots, V 2/2g ~443 ft).Further, since the changes on the ec t or Le s occur over a fairly substantial time 5 it is reasonable then to assume that the term can be ted the need for the acceleration factor.This also that the !I energy s t a t c" to be used in this Converting to altitude as the independent variable, the cost function (3.1b) can be written asI hCR ~(F) (F) 1 ( J = - + - dh + o ft UP -h DST V F ) R + Vw CR CR (3.4)where V w is the wind and R CR is the cruise range.In addition, the range must satisfy J"rtFR F = (V cos y + Vw)up dt + RcR + J~(V o t DST cos y + VW)DST dtwhere y is the flightpath angle.Written in terms of h as the independent variable, this becomes~(V cos. y + V w). + (V cos_. y + V w) Jdh + RCR L h UP h DST (3.Sa)The integral constraint (3.Sa) can be more easily treated by introducing a range variable R(h) and rewriting as a differential equation constraint:(3.

Properties of Optimal Controls(3.11e)The minimization of H up and H DST in (3.11) is a double minimization that must be performed at each altitude.For this study we look at functionals of the form: For the particular problem in this study we show that the available power that minimizes HUp or HDST must always lie on the boundary of the admissible set.We consider separately the ascent and descent segments of the trajectory.For simplicity we assume that the wind is zero.F = + cFWF3.2.1 Ascent-In the ascent segment, the rate of cUmb is given by (3.14) where PR = PR(V) is the cruise power required at some h, V. On ascent the power must satisfy the constraint: The graph of (3.16) is as shown in figure 3.2.Since (3.16) is a bilinear function of P, its derivative is nowhere zero and the region P:: P R is excluded from the allowable control region by (3.15).Consequently, for the ascent segment of the traj ectory we have (3.17)Since the optimal P is established by (3.17), we c.an now consider the variation of H Up with V. Generally, we can assume the optimal V will lie on the increasing region of P R and must be less than some specified V ma x for each altitude.Further V is bounded by V J • the equilibrium flight veloeity for P = P ma x' The numerator of (3.18), being linear in V with F ma x and both positive~has one zero which we call V z' that is~z ~O.Depending upon whether V z > VI or V z < Vl~the graph of B Up takes On different shapes as shown in figures 3.4(a) and 3.4(b).If V 1 < V ma x' VF ma x V z ( F) min - V V Ih=hCR (3.19)Consequently, we see that for case (b) to occur minV (~)h-h -CR (3.20)That is the optimum cruise cost increases with altitude.Further, if the cruise costis not an absolute minimum on rO-~-hCR]--at the cruise altitude, thenthis case must occur at some point, causing the b re akdown in the optimality conditions.The situation changes slightly if there exists a velocity limit, V ma x' which makes the equilibrium speed V, unattainable.In this case, as shown in figure 3.5, the minimum of H Up occurs at V = V ma x' Can this case actually occur?From the definition of V z we haveF V ma xHence, the V ma x limitation in this case forces the helicopter to climb at a speed which is more fuel expensive than at the cruise altitude.Physically this seems to be a realizable situation.In the alternate case where V z < V ma x < V" then H~p < 0 and Fmax/Vmax < 1jJ.Physically it seems contradictory to even want to climb in this condition since by lowering the applied power (thereby lowering F) we can cruise at a lower altitude than heR and expend les~fuel per unit distance traveled.This apparent paradox is caused by the fact that we are treating hCR as a fixed limit.Consider min(F/V) V as a function of altitude, where F is evaluated at the cruise power.If min (F/V)V is increasing on the interval [h,h CR] then direct construction shows that a lower cost can be achieved by cruising at h rather than at hCR' The optimality of hCR (for small perturbations) must be ascertained examining the t r ave r sa Li.ty condition O.lle).This condition is examined later in this section.

Behavior of Optimal Solution as h + h CRIn the fixed-wing case Erzberger and Lee found that the optimal climb/descent speed and power generally blended in smoothly with the corresponding cruise parameters as h + h CR.In addition a nonzero cruise segment generally only oecurred at one altitude the altitude for optimum cruise, where ~i s a minimum.For the helicopter problem in this report, the assumed linear fuel-flow relationship with power forces the power to be discontinuous at the eruise altitude.We shall show, however, that the velocities at cruise are continuous.In addition it will be shown that the climb and descent coefficients introduced in section 2 cause the cruiae behavior of the helicopter to be significantly different from that of the fixed-Wing aircraft.At any altitude below hCR the optimum power on the climb/descent segments are Pmax/Pmin as derived previously.Hence, we fix the power at these levels to investigate the behavior of the optimal speeds as in the vicinity of hCR.Our conclusion then is that the optimal ascent and descent speeds approach the cruise speed as h + hCR'While the optimal power is discontinuous at cruise.we see that as 11 -+ heR and V + VCR the hyperbolic variations of H Up and H nST shown in figures 3.2 and 3.6 tend to a rectilinear hyperbola implying that the Hamiltonians are effectively independent of power in this region.Thus, while the limits of the minimizing values are discontinuous, the Hamiltonian itself is very insensitive to these variations at the point of discontinuity.Nato that tho two terms in Hare H Up and HOST implying that for this case these terms are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.For the case where the climb and descent factors are not equalH* = cFbW (If---. _1 ) CLB "uSTThere exists a nonzero cruise distance at all cruise altitudes given by:(3.33) (3.34) Equation (3.33) also confirms our earlier result that the cruise cost must be decreasing at the cruise altitude since otherwise the cruise range from (~.34) would be negative.As hCR + h*, the derivative (d/dh) (FCR/VCR) + 0 while H ~O. Hence, for this case the optimal cruise altitude for any fixed range trajectory is always below the optimal cruise altitude h*.The use of the climb and descent factors introduces an additional dilemma, however, which is yet to be resolved.For the data used in this report we have assumed (and verified computationally) that kCLB < kDST.For this case H* > 0 and the optimum range can be ascertained by use of (3.34).The dilemma concerns the hypothetical case where k CLB > k DST' If this case were to occur then H* < O. Equation (3.34) can only be satisfied if FCR/V CR is increasing with altitude.Tbis, however, is precisely the case which was disallowed in minimization of H Up, HDST at altitudes below cruise.
NUMERICAL RESULTS
Characteristics of Fuel Optimal TrajectoriesA computer program was written which generates the optimal trajectories using the helicopter model and optimization algorithm developed in this report.The program numerically integrates the climb and descent portions of the trajectory optimizing the ascent and descent Hamiltonians at each step, simultaneously.For the cruise segment the cruise cost and speed are computed using a cruise weight computed as the average of the beginning and end weights on the cruise.Since these weights are not known initially, this process is done iteratively until the weights converge.Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all results in this report are for the case of minimum fuel cost in zero wind.A typical set of trajectories is as shown in figure 4.1 for an initial weight of 14,000 lb.To generate these curves tbe cruise altitude was first specified, then the cruise range was calculated based on boundary condition (3.lle), which must be satisfied at the optimal altitude and range.A descent rate constraint of 30 ft/sec was used on all trajectories.As a consequence of a nonunity climb factor (k CLB = 0.75, kDSI = 1.0) all trajectories have a nonzero cruise range which in fact shows very little variation with altitude.The lack of variation is due primarily to the fact that the derivative dw/db is almost constant in this entire altitude range.Since the final Hamiltonian H* is also relatively fixed, the subsequent At low initial weights (see fig. 2.7) At high weights (~19,000 Ib) the opti-cruise range computed from (3.11e) exhibits very little variation with altitude.The same is true for moderately higher weights as shown in figure 4.2.For weights less than about 17,000 Ib, the cruise cost is a monotonically decreasing function of altitude.Renee, for longer ranges, the optimal cruise altitude is increasingly higher.For the S-61N the maximum allowable altitude is 12,000 ft.At this altitude and using an initial weight of 14,000 Ib, the natural boundary condition on altitude yields a trajectory with total range of about 33 n.mi.(see fig. 4.1).For a trajectory with a specified range greater than this value, the minimrnn fuel trajectory cruises at the limit altitude of 12,000 ft.At this altitude, the cruise segment is determined not from the transversality condition, but from the total range condition:It is important to note that the mathematically optimum altitude is very significantly a function of initial weight.The most important parameter in establishing the optimum altitude is the variation with altitude of the quasi-steady "cruise cost" + = min(WF!V).Using our variational approach, the optimum cruise altitude is at or V slightly below, the altitude for minimum +.the optimum cruise is at hmax = 12,000 ft.mum altitude is at hmin ~O.Although the curves of cruise cost change smoothly with weight, the optimum altitude changes rather abruptly from hmax to hmin at a weight slightly greater than 17,000 lb.It should be pointed out that at the higher weights and higher altitudes, the smoothed power model (A) departs significantly from the pointwise model (B).Thus, while at 17,000 Ib the smoothed model (A) predicts improved cruise performance up to hmax' the pointwise model (B) predicts rapidly deteriorating performance for altitudes greater than about 8,000 ft.Similarly at the 19,000 Ib weight, for altitudes above 8,000, the smoothed model (A) predicts substantially less degradation than the pointwise model (B).The significance of these differences can be more easily evaluated by observing the fuel variation on minimum fuel trajectories, where the cruise altitude is constrained at a nonoptimal value.Figure 4.3 demonstrates this effect using the smoothed (A) model.For the 14,000 Ib vehicle, cruise at the optimal altitude of 12,000 ft represents about a 5% improvement over cruise at 1,000 ft.Since the two fitting techniques (A and B) agree so closely in this low-weight range these results are felt to be reliable and represent a true fuel savings.For the heavy weight of 19,000 Ib, the figure similarly predicts a substantial fuel saving of about 10% by choice of the lowest possible cruise altitude (here 1,000 ft).Comparison of the optimal cruise costs in figure 2.7 indicates that at the lowest altitude the "A" model predicts significantly better fuel consumption than the "B" model, hence the low value of about 480 Ib fuel in figure 4.3 is probably not attainable.At high altitudes the reverse is true, however J as the "A" model does not fit the cruise data well in this range and predicts significantly better fuel consumption than the "B" model.Thus, while the trend predicted in figure 4.3 is correct the actual minimum fuel used is probably in error and the penalty for high cruise altitudes may be greater than that shown.At the intermediate weight of 17 ,000 lb the cruise cost of 2.7 shows little variation with altitudes for performance model "A."Similarly in figure 4.3 the total fuel consumed varies by only about 10 Ib for all cruise altitudes from 1,000 ft to 12,000 ft.Thus, in this weight range there is little to be gained by optimizing cruise altitude (of course velocity must still be optimized!).In view of the differences between the "A" and "B" models at the high altitudes, conservative engineering judgment indicates that a cruise altitude below 8,000 ft is probably appropriate.The identical curves for a 100 n. mi.range mission are shown in figure 4.4.While the behavior is similar, we observe that there is slightly more variation in the 17,000 lb case.The reason for this is that the cruise fuel is based on the average cruise weight.Thus, while the initial weights on figures 4.3 and 4.4 are the same, the "average cruise weight" for the 100 n .mf., range is almost 200 lb less than in the former case.Note also that since the ~is different, the ascent and descent Hamiltonian is slightly different; therefore, the resulting climb and descent profiles are not exactly the same in the two cases.In general, a smaller, more favorable cruise parameter y causes the ascent leg of the optimal trajectory to be steeper and to climb more quickly, making the climb segment shorter and the cruise segment longer.
Speed Variation on Optimal TrajectoriesOptimal climb speeds on the minimum fuel trajectories tend to be much faster than tbe speeds for fastest climb rate (60-70 knots).At comparable altitudes the speed in descent is generally faster than the speed in climb.The variation of the optimal speeds for one particular weight is shown in figure 4.5 for various cruise altitudes.Dumerical minimization of the Hamiltonian does confirm, in fact, that at the cruise altitude, the three speeds VUP' VnST' and VCR all coalesce to a single value.The advantage of trading off climb rate for forward speed can be seen in table 4.1 which compares an optimal climb-cruise-descent profile with a fastest climb-optimal cruiseoptimal descent profile of the same total range.For the fastest climb rate, flight speeds are between 60 and 70 knots true airspeed.,"'hile the advantage is slight, only about 2%, it should be pointed out that the fuel consumed in this case is dominated by the long cruise.In a shorter-range trajectory, it is antitipcated that the relative advantage of the optimal profile will be increased.Sensitivity of the speed profile to the helicopter performance model can be deduced by computing trajectories under different hypotheses.Thus, figure 4.6 shows the effeet of using the smoothed model (A) or the pointwise model (8).In this case the speed differences are less than 5 knots everywhere on the trajectory.Even less important in determining the elimb velocity is the climb factor keLB' Figure 4.7 shows that the optimal speed Is essentially independent ef the climb factor for the case shown.The optimal trajectory will of cour se differ substantially.The lack of sensitivity to these model parameters is typical of the cases examined and seems to indicate that the optimal results presented here can be applied (judiciously as alw8Ys) even if there exists some uncertainty regarding the correctness of the helicopter dynamic model.
Effect of WindsThe magnitude and direction of winds are known to have a substantial effect on the optimal performance of any aircraft.This effect is accentuated on a conventional he licopter because of the low flight speeds which make even a moderate wind fairly important.The minimum fuel consumption for the l7,OOO-Ib helicopter flying in -20, 0, and +20 knot,wind is shown in figure 4.8 (negative values are headwinds, positive values are tailwinds).The effect of the wind on the fuel consumption is obviously an important factor, but it is perhaps more important to note that there is a substantial difference in the "optimal lf flight profile through such an environment.Figure 4.9 compares the optimal airspeeds on these same trajectories.A tailwind tends to decrease the optimal airspeed at all altitudes and to increase it for a headwind.This is in accord with the generally accepted effect of wind on the quasi-steady performance quantities.Wind variation with altitude is also easily handled by the optimization algorithm and again the altitude variation can have an important role in determining the optimal speed profile and the optimal altitude.Figures 4. 10 and4.11show the fuel cost and the optimal climb speed for trajectories with various winds, including a linear wind wher e the wind velocity varies from 20 knots at h = 0 to SO knots at h = 12,000 ft.While these winds are fairly substantial, they do represent, in fact, a typical environment for helicopters operating in off-shore areas.The winds are added into the trajectory logic with little or no increase in complexity.The main difficulty with incorporating winds into an on-line procedure is the problem of determining the actual wind profile in the area of flight.If such knOWledge can be obtained, the potential payoff is substantial.
General Cost OptimizationThe previous results have all applied to a direet fuel minimization.The general cost function specified in this analysis allows a weighting between time and fuel.This can be used to minimize a "dollar" cost if an appropriate cost of time and fuel is specified.In addition, by varying the weight factor on time (cT)' the total flight time ean be controlled.Determining an appropriate numerical value for cF is done by simply inspecting the cost of fuel.For standard JP-4 at $1.l6/gal at 6.5 Ib/gal, this leads to cF = SO.18/1b.The time weight factor, cT' is a more subtle number to select.While direct operating costs are generally quoted as $500-$1,000/hr, the cost savings due to a decreased time is probab less than this value.Using cF = SO.18/1b, the effect of c T on the time of flight and the fuel required is plotted as a function of the cruise altitnde in figure 4.12.Even when cT = 0 (direct fnel minimization) the optimal speeds lie close to, or on, the VNE boundary (compare the VNE profiles shown in figure 2.8 to thc speed profiles as in figures 4.9 and 4.11).The sudden slope discontinuity, at h CR" 8,000 ft in figure 4.12 on the cT =:: 0 curve indicates the point where the optimal cruise speeds are being pushed back by the receding VNE boundary, thereby increasIng the time of flight.By making cT positive, optimal speeds are increased.When cT reaches $lOOjhr, the "optimal" speed is simply VNE at all points on the trajectory independent of the cruise altitude chosen.In this case, the minimum flight time occurs at about a cruise altitude of 5$000 f t , whe r e the maximum VNE this weight)occurs.If the cruise altitude is ixed, increasing cT beyond $IOa/hr cannot change the trajectory since the velocity is aLr e ady at a constraint bcun da r y • It will change the "coa t " certainly and will change the "op t t rnurn" cruise altitude -w.it.h larger values of the optimal cruise altitude to drop to the minimum time altitude.The values of to use in a realistic environment must be determined by the helicopter operator.For this j with a fixed 50 n~mi.range, the minimum-fuel ectcry cruises at 12}OOO ft and uses 375 Ib fuel with a flight duration of 0,45 hr, or 2; min.For the minimum-time ector], on the other hand, the cruise is at 5,000 ft, the total trip time is about 5 min shorter, and the fuel consumed is an extra 100 lb.
CONCLUDINC REMARKSThe on-line determination of optimal flightpaths for helicopters has been shown to be useful and computationally feasible.The two developments which permit the solution to this problem are:(1) an efficient, simple performance model for the helicopter and (2) use of the simplified "climb-cruise-descent," trajectoryoptimization model.To ensure the accuracy requirement for the helicopter performance model it seems mandatory that the analytical model be empirically curve-fitted to the flighttest data.The model used in this report is based on a simple power model fit for various altitudes and weights.For more general studies, a more refined model would be desirable and should probably be based on a parameterization in terms of more fundamental performance variables such as thrust coefficient and advance ratio.Nevertheless, for the specific vehicle under consideration, the optimal trajectories dS computed are believed to be quite realistic.The primary characteristics of the optimal trajectories can be summarized as follows:1.The speeds on fuel optimal trajectories tend to be fairly fast, that is, near the maximum speed of the vehicle.Speeds on the climb leg of the optimal trajectories tend to be significantly faster than the speed for greatest climb rate.As the length of the cruise segment increases, the optimal climb speed does, however, tend to approach that for greatest rate of climb.For many cases, particularly at high altitudes, the optimal climb speeds are limited by the V NE boundary of the aircraft.This situation and the fact that much of the flight manual power required data are also outside the VNE boundary seems quite unusual.If the quoted VNE boundary can reasonably be extended some improvement in performance could be achieved.2. In contrast to the fixed-wing aircraft, all optimal helicopter trajectories have a nonzero cruise segment because of the nonunity climb factor used in the performance model..The cruise segment distance tends to be relatively constant at a small value until the cruise altitude approaches the altitude for minimum cruise cost at which point the cruise segment is determined by the range constraint..In practice the optimal altitudes are at sea level for the heavy weight case (I' ~17,000 Lb ) and at 12,000 ft (the maximum altitude) for low weights (W ~15,000 lb), For the intermediate weights (16,000 c 17,000 Ib) the optimal altitudes change from the minimum to the maximum value.The difference in fuel consumed for all cruise a.ltitudes is slight, however, in this weight range and in view of uncertainty associated with the high altitude performance model for this weight, the low to intermediate cruise altitude should be chosen.3. The descent segment of the trajectory is always flown on a minimum power constraint of some type.While the fuel consumed in the descent segment is generally much less than on the remainder of the trajeotory (henoe, fuel optimization is much less critical)~the descent range is crucial in determining the length of the remainĩ ug trajectory segments.A primary consideration in establishing any descent criteria is to avoid autorotation and the vortex ring state, The constraint used almost exc in this report was a fixed descent rate of 1,800 ft/min.This was judged reasonable for VFR eetories based on conversations with several helicopter pilots.on weather and to the ground} lower descent rates
AbstractAn optimal flightpath algorithm using a simplified altitude state model and an a priori climbcruise-descent flight profile has been developed and applied to determine minimum fuel and minimum cost trajectories for a helicopter flying a fixed-range trajectory.In addition, a method is developed for obtaining a performance model in simplified form which is based on standard flightmanual data and which is applicable to the computation of optimal trajectories.The entire performance-optimization algorithm is simple enough that on-line trajectory optimization is feasible with a relatively small computer.The helicopter model used in this study is the Sikorsky S-6lN.The results show that for this vehicle the optimal flightpath and optimal cruise altitude can represent a 10% fuel saving on a minimum-fuel traj ec tory.The optimal trajectories show considerable variability because of helicopter weight, ambient winds, and the relative cost trade-off between time and fuel.In general, "reasouab Ie' variations from the optimal velocities and cruise altitudes do not significantly degrade the optimal cost.For fuel-optimal trajectories, the optimum cruise altitude varies from the maximum (12,000 f t ) to the minimum (0 f t ) depending on helicopter weight.If time of flight is an important component of the cost function, then significant reductions in flight time from the minimum-fuel trajectory are achieved with only minor increases in fuel cost.FIGURES

could be imposed.It should be noted that optimum flight speeds are independent of the particular descent rate chosen.Because the descent range is crucial in determining the length of the other trajectory segments, additional input is needed, particularly from pilots, to determine what type of descent criteria is most appropriate for either manual or automatic flightpath control.
4.Substantial decreases in time of flight can be achieved with only a small fuel penalty.Generally, the weighting of time on the optimal trajectory tends to force the cruise altitudes toward the altitude for greatest true airspeed -about 5,000 ft for this vehicle (the exact altitude depends on weight).Speeds in this case are generally on a VNE boundary.Further work needs to be performed to improve and/or validate the performance model used in this report.This should include more detailed analytical modeling as well as flight-test verification.Topics for further study include:(1) trajectory integration with the takeoff and landing phases of vehicle operation, (2) integration of the optimal trajectory system with 3-D and 4-D flightpath guidance systems, and (3) more rigorous comparison of the optimal trajectories with the results of an unconstrained optimization.
