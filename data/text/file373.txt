IntroductionRunning air traffic simulations usually requires a way to visualize and interact with traffic data and airspace.Though existing simulation tools [1,2,3] may be used, they are heavily integrated with software modules that have been built to meet specific research and/or simulation needs.In addition, in order to easily add new capabilities to visualize geospatial, air traffic, weather and environment data, there is a need to have a general, simple yet powerful, responsive and extensible visualization tool.To address these challenges, the Air Traffic Management (ATM) TestBed under the ATM-eXploration (ATM-X) Project [4] provides a two-dimensional, layered traffic and airspace visualization tool called Traffic Viewer that allows users to customize features and extend capabilities to meet their project needs.Based on the ATM TestBed architecture, Traffic Viewer can be used to visualize live, historical and simulated traffic and airspace data.For example, Figure 1.1 shows a screenshot of a Traffic Viewer (version 2.0a) subscribing to four live data feeds from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) System Wide Information Management (SWIM) via the NASA's Sherlock ATM Data Warehouse [5].Aircraft icons are color-coded to indicate their originating data feeds.
Getting StartedThe Traffic Viewer project is stored in a Git repository1 located at NASA Ames Research Center.The project can be built using Gradle build tool and Oracle Java Standard Edition (SE) Development Kit 8.The tool requires Apache ActiveMQ and Oracle Java 8 to run; the required software is listed in Table 2.1.After building the source code and launching the application in the TrafficViewer directory, a user will see an application frame.The Traffic Viewer project stores default application settings in a configuration file located at config/TrafficViewer.properties.Default settings are always loaded during start up and their values may be overridden in a separate, project-specific configuration file.The run script accepts an optional parameter -config and the parameter expects a path of a configuration file to be used.Configuration files typically use the file extension .propertiesand are stored in the config directory.Listing 2.4 lists an example to run the visualization tool using an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) project configuration file:
Project Directory LayoutThe ATM TestBed and Traffic Viewer projects use the standard Maven project directory layout [10].The description of each major directory in the project is listed in Table 2.2.Whenever building or running the visualization tool, additional directories will be created in the project directory.These directories can be kept or deleted without affecting the functionality of the application:1.The build directory stores the build-related folders and files generated by the build tool.2. The logs directory stores the log files generated by application loggers.3. The sntb.record directory stores the metadata generated by TestBed framework.
Configuration FilesConfiguration files store application settings that are bound at launch time and the settings can be modified without rebuilding the project.User-configurable settings can also be declared in the Component Definition File.During development, a user may override the userconfigurable settings in the User-Defined Properties File and modify simulation run settings in the Simulation Run File.When adding new features to the visualization tool, a user may introduce project-specific configuration files.By coding convention, all configuration files are stored in the $SNTB_HOME/TestBedPlugins/TrafficViewer/config directory.The following subsections describe each configuration file in detail.A user may modify any of the following three sections in the component definition file for specific project needs.1. Unique Component Identifier (line 3)-The ucid field value is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [12] string consisting of three segments separating by a forward-slash (/) delimiter: a. Project name, e.g., SNTB Simulation b.Component name, e.g., Traffic Viewer c. Component version, e.g., 1.0 Any or all of these segment values may be modified to support project branding and versioning control, e.g., My Project/My Traffic Viewer/2.0a.Note that the field value must also be updated in the simulation run file located at config/sntb.run.
Input interfaces (lines 16 to 25)-The inputs field value is a JSON array of inputinterfaces supported by Traffic Viewer.For example, the input interface datasets.TrackDataset is supported and whenever a Track message is received from the messaging middleware, the method TrafficViewer.processTrackDataset (String, Track)3 will be called.A user may add new input interfaces and their corresponding process dataset methods must be added.3. Output interfaces (lines 26 to 31)-The outputs field value is also a JSON array of output interfaces supported by Traffic Viewer.By default, no output interface is specified.A user may replace the value "None" with a specific dataset type, e.g., datasets.TrackDataset and the method PluginAdapter.publish(Track) defined in the superclass is expected to be called inside the Traffic Viewer class.Additional output interfaces may be added.In addition, the component definition file stores user-configurable settings and their default values in the properties field (omitted in Listing 2.5).
User-Defined Properties FileDuring development, a user may override any default values in the User-Defined Properties File located at config/sntb.properties in JSON format.
Simulation Run FileATM TestBed supports concurrent simulations whereby their simulation settings are defined in a JSON file located at config/sntb.run(see Listing 2.6).Each simulation is uniquely identified by a 24-hexadecimal simulation run identifier.The identifier value is specified in the runId field and its default value is a string with 24 zeros ("0000000000000000000000000").Whenever the file is loaded, the default value will be replaced based on the simulation launch mode:1.For simulations launched from a web browser accessing the TestBed Web Portal, the value will be replaced with a unique string generated by a back-end database, e.g., "5de9596a4a57cbd97d445d01." 2. For simulations launched from a local development environment, the value will be automatically resolved into a string using the local Internet Protocol (IP) address prefixed with 12 zeros, e.g., "000000000000192168001002" for the IP address 192.168.001.002.Keep in mind that if a simulation requires running multiple Traffic Viewer instances, the instances need to have unique, positive component sequence values.The sequence value is specified in the componentSeq field and its default value is one (1).Listing 2.6.Default sntb.runproperties { "componentId": 0, "componentSeq": 1, "componentUcid": "SNTB Simulation/Traffic Viewer/1.0","runId": "000000000000000000000000" }
Application Configuration FilesThe default application settings are stored in the configuration file located at config/TrafficViewer.properties.A project may override any default settings in a projectspecific configuration file.The settings are fully discussed in Section 4.
User InterfaceTraffic Viewer is a graphical user interface application.A user interacts with the application via toolbar, viewer canvas and status bar widgets using mouse and keyboard.This section briefly describes each widget.
ToolbarThe toolbar located at the top of the application frame provides menu buttons for accessing features supported by layers (see Section 4).Initially, each layer has a menu toggle button to allow a user to enable (menu button is selected) or disable (menu button is deselected) the layer.Whenever a layer menu has more than one menu item, the menu toggle button becomes a split drop-down button.A split drop-down button has a down-pointing arrow on the right-hand side.Clicking on the split drop-down button will pop up a menu listing all available menu items.To illustrate differences between a menu toggle button and a split drop-down button, Figure 3.1 shows a toolbar with three selected layer menu buttons: (a) Map Tile, (b) Boundary, and (c) Clock.Notice that both (a) and (b) are split drop-down buttons while (c) is a toggle button.In addition, the drop-down menu (d) of the Boundary layer is shown.The menu buttons can also be accessed by pressing a number key 1 (to select the first menu button) through key 0 (to select the last menu button) on the keyboard.Pressing the space key will toggle a menu toggle button or show a menu.Menu items and descriptions of each toolbar button will be described in Section 4.
Viewer CanvasThe viewer canvas component located at the center of the Traffic Viewer provides a rectangular region for layers to draw elements such as map tile images, airspace boundaries and vehicle icons.The top-left corner of the viewer canvas represents the anchor of the world map; thus, resizing the application frame to a higher or a lower dimension will not affect the anchor reference.The viewer canvas supports the following mouse interactions:1. Panning the anchor by dragging (click on the left mouse button and then drag).2. Zooming the view by scrolling the mouse wheel (rotate up/down to zoom in/out).3. Tracking the world location by moving the mouse cursor.4. Locking or unlocking a visual element that is closest to the cursor (double click on the left mouse button when the cursor mode is selected).Whenever a user interacts with the viewer canvas using the mouse, the current geo-location at the cursor tip is indicated on the Location Information status bar (see Section 5.7), element keys (such as vehicle IDs) of the currently locked visual elements are displayed on the Cursor status panel (see Section 5.9).The viewer canvas also has a registry for storing information extracted from messages received from the TestBed messaging middleware.The registry may be accessed by individual layers.
Status BarThe status bar located at the bottom of the application frame provides status bar buttons and information for individual layers.Clicking on a status bar button will show a setting dialog.Figure 3.2 shows the status bar with the Map settings dialog after the map status bar button is clicked.Menu items and descriptions of each status bar button will be described in Section 4.
LayersIn computer graphics, graphical elements of a complex drawing are rendered in separate layers in order to provide modularity and improve the performance of the application.Many graphical applications and visualization tools use layers to separate rendering elements [13,14,15].Layers are used in Traffic Viewer to support the following features:1. Same elements can be rendered on the same layer.2. Individual layers can be enabled, disabled or reordered.3. New layers can be added, and existing layers can be removed.4. Separate elements can be handled in separate layers.
. Layers in Traffic ViewerEach layer must be a subclass of the abstract class Layer 4 and the subclass requires implementing the four abstract methods listed in Listing 4.1.A layer instance is initialized with a config parameter storing settings defined in the application configuration file.A toggle button or a split drop-down menu button to be shown on the toolbar is constructed by a layer menu.Whenever a change that might affect the draw operations is made by a user, the layer will be notified by a change type parameter.Finally, the paint method is called to draw elements on the layer.Both geo-coordinates and screen-coordinates affine transformations are supported when drawing graphical elements in a two-dimensional space.The former one is used for rendering elements based on geo-coordinates (, ) in degrees decimal form; the latter one is used for rendering elements based on screen-coordinates (, ) in pixels.Table 4.1 lists the affine matrices, where  ! and  " are the pixel coordinates (see Section 4.1.1).The screencoordinates affine transformation is used by default, and its affine matrix is an identity matrix.Listing 4.2 lists an example code snippet illustrating how to draw the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airport code "KSFO" at San Francisco International Airport using the geo-coordinates affine transformation.The fully qualified class names of the layers to be shown to the users need to be defined in the property layer_class_list.A layer is disabled by default unless its fully qualified class name is also defined in the property layer_class_list_enabled.Table 4.2 lists the properties that may be used to control the availability of the layers.Note that long property names are split into two lines, and the values are defined in project-specific configuration files.In order to avoid unnecessary computation whenever a repaint operation is performed, generated graphical elements and incoming messages can be stored in in-memory, time-based caches and registries.The properties specific to retention periods have the name suffix retention_period, e.g., cache_retention_period, and they are listed in Table 4.3.Layers provided by Traffic Viewer are described in the following subsections.
Map Tile LayerThe Map Tile Layer displays a world map by drawing map tile images provided by map providers.This layer is the first, i.e., bottommost, layer on the viewer canvas in the default settings.The map tile images are square images with dimension 256 pixels in width and 256 pixels in height, i.e., 256  × 256  7 .Images are generated from sources using Web Mercator Projection [16] based on zoom levels.A zoom level is a non-negative integer determining the number of map tile images needed to cover the world map.At zoom level zero, only one map tile image is needed (see Figure 4.2), i.e., the entire world is rendered in a single map tile image.At each subsequent higher zoom level, both the width and the height dimensions of the world map are doubled.For example, at zoom level one, the world is composed of four (two by two) map tile images and each map tile image still has the dimension 256  × 256  (see Figure 4.3).(0,0)(1,0) (0,1) (1,1) 8 Source:• https://basemap.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/USGSImageryOnly/MapServer/tile/0/0/0 9Sources:
px pxThe higher the zoom level, the higher the number of map tile images the world map is composed of.In general, at zoom level , the world map is covered by 2 # × 2 # = 2 $•# number of map tile images.Since each map tile image has the dimension 256  × 256 , the world is covered by 2 $•# × 256 $ pixels.At each zoom level, map tile images can be referenced by tile coordinates ( !,  " ), where (0, 0) represents the tile at the top-left corner, and (1, 0) represents the second tile in the first row.Thus, a world map at zoom level  has tile coordinates ranging from (0, 0), the top-left tile, to (2 # -1, 2 # -1), the bottom-right tile.Without loss of generality, the map tile image coordinates can be represented by a tuple of three integers (,  !,  " ), where  ≥ 0, and  !,  " ∈ [0, 2 # -1].
Web Mercator ProjectionThe Web Mercator Projection is a special form of Mercator Projection which projects the world onto a square image using four types of coordinates [17], as described in Table 4
Pixels with integer precisionLinear projection of pixel coordinates onto the tile space.Table 4.5 lists the projection functions used in Traffic Viewer to project a location from one coordinate system to another.One may apply these functions in series to find the screen coordinates ( !,  " ) of specific map coordinates ( !,  " ).= ⌊2 # • 𝑤 ! ⌋ 𝑝 " = `2# • 𝑤 " a 3. World Tile 𝑡 ! = b 2 # • 𝑤 ! 256 c 𝑡 " = d 2 # • 𝑤 " 256 eInverse functions are needed in order to handle the user interactions such as querying the geo-location ( !,  " ) = (, ) at the cursor location ( !,  " ) on the application screen.Table 4.6 lists the inverse projection functions used in Traffic Viewer to un-project a location from the pixel coordinate system to the map coordinate system.Thus, given a cursor's location on the viewer canvas, the inverse functions can be applied to find the latitude and longitude location at the cursor's location.

Windows in ${user.home} 10 \.sntb\TrafficViewer\cache\map_tile\.2. Linux in ~/.sntb/TrafficViewer/cache/map_tile/.  10 The macro ${user.home}represents the user's home directory, e.g., C:\Users\clai\.
Map Tile Layer PropertiesTable 4.7 lists the properties related to the map tile layer with the property name prefix map_tile.These properties apply to enabled map tile providers.Since map providers may have different maximum zoom levels, to ensure map tiles from all the map providers will be displayed, Traffic Viewer limits the maximum zoom level.Given a list of map providers,  = { & ,  $ , … ,  3 }, defined in the properties, the upper zoomable level supported in the map tile layer is the minimum value of the maxZoomLevel properties among the map providers regardless they are enabled or not, thus,    = min4∈[&..3]{( 4 )}
Map Tile Layer MenuTable 4.10 lists the menu items associated with the map tile layer.Each menu item and its description in the drop-down menu will be listed in this section.A checkmark (✓) symbol on the first column indicates a check box menu item is initially selected, thus, the associated feature is initially enabled.The sources, attributions, and copyright information of the map tile image providers are shown in the "About Map Tiles" dialog (see Figure 4.6).The information is obtained by the map provider's three properties: name, attribution, and source.
Map Tile Setting MenuSetting menus on the status bar can be found in the following subsections: Map Settings …………………………………………………………………………... 5.7.Location Information ………………………………………………………………….. 5.9.Cursor Status …………………………………………………………………………..
Boundary LayerThe Boundary Layer draws named boundaries of airspace such as Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), sectors, and subsectors using polygons and texts that are defined in boundary definition files.The polygons are represented in GeoJSON format [22] and an example snippet of a boundary definition is listed in Listing 4.4..json.gzGZIP [23] file of a plain text file.Linux platform.3..json.zipZIP [24] archive file of a plain text file.Windows platform.Users may show or hide a specific group of boundaries via the layer drop-down menu.For example, all the high-altitude sectors are initially hidden, and a user may change them to visible by selecting the "High Sector" menu item.In addition, specific boundaries may be shown or hidden by entering their names in the Boundary settings dialog (see Section 4.2.3).
Boundary Layer PropertiesProperties related to the boundary layer have the prefix boundary.Table 4.12 lists the properties used in this layer.
Boundary Setting MenuSetting menu on the status bar can be found in the following subsection: 0.Clicking on the Darker button or moving the slider's knob towards the Darker button will decrease the brightness of the map tiles (see Figure 5.3(a)).On the other hand, clicking on the Brighter button or moving the slider's knob towards the Brighter button will increase the brightness of the map tiles (see Figure 5.3(b)).Boundary Settings …………………………………………………………………….47
Range Ring LayerThe Range Ring Layer draws range rings on the canvas to measure the distance from a specific location.Clicking on the layer menu button will enable or disable the layer.Though the layer menu is a toggle button and does not provide additional menu items, a user may control the range rings in the Range Rings settings dialog (see Section 4.3.1),including the center location of the range rings, distance labels between two consecutive rings, number of rings, and locations of the distance labels.Figure 4.9 shows a screenshot of Traffic Viewer with ten rings, separated by 20 nmi, centered at the San Francisco International Airport, and the ring distance labels located at both the East (90°) and the South (180°) directions.4.15 lists the properties defined in the range ring layer with the name pattern gov.nasa.sntb.trafficviewer.ui.layer.RangeRingLayer.<Name>.These range ring properties define the colors of the rings and the distance labels.
Range Ring Setting MenuSetting menu on the status bar can be found in the following subsection: 5.4.Range Ring Settings …………………………………………………………………. 47
Flight Plan LayerThe Flight Plan Layer draws flight plan routes and displays their associated waypoint names.Flight plan routes are defined in the Flight Plan Data Exchange Model messages.The routes are values defined in the "Route of Flight" field of the FAA Form 7233-1 [25].A route of flight consists of a departure point, a series of waypoints, and a destination point.An example of the route of flight is listed in Listing 4.5.This layer uses the FAA's Aeronautical Data (formerly called National Flight Data Center) [26] files to resolve the waypoint locations into geo-locations.In simulation experiments, the Aeronautical Data may not cover all the waypoints needed.For example, an experiment may want to use new airspace adaptation data or assign existing waypoints to alternate locations.To address these use cases, Traffic Viewer supports custom mappings of waypoint and geolocation.The resolution of a waypoint to a geo-location is based on three lookup sourcesruntime settings, properties, and custom files:1.The runtime settings are specified using the Flight Plan setting menu (see Section 5.5).This allows a user to dynamically specify mappings during a simulation experiment.2. The properties are specified in the file located at config/sntb.properties.This allows a user to specify mappings while configuring a simulation experiment.3. The custom files, in GeoJSON format, are specified by the property name gov.nasa.sntb.trafficviewer.ui.layer.FlightPlanLayer.waypointFiles.This allows a user to specify mappings for a simulation experiment.4.16 lists the properties defined in the flight plan layer with the name pattern gov.nasa.sntb.trafficviewer.ui.layer.FlightPlanLayer.<Name>.The properties define the colors of the flight plan routes and waypoint names, as well as the location of the custom waypoint files.4.18 lists the menu items associated with the flight path layer.The menu items let a user show or hide flown trajectories that are published from specific data sources.The "cursor" mode, when selected, hides flight paths of all vehicles except the one that is closest to the cursor.
Menu Item Description✓ Enabled Enables/disables the flight path layer.
CursorIf selected, shows the flight path of the vehicle that is closed to the cursor only.All Selects all the data sources.Use this menu item to enable all the data sources.
NoneClears selections of all the data sources.Use this menu item to disable all the data sources.✓ <Data Source> Shows/hides flight paths that are associated with the data source.
Trajectory LayerThe Trajectory Layer draws predicted paths of flights.Figure 4.12 shows a screenshot of the trajectory layer displaying a predicted path of a single flight currently in Fort Worth ARTCC (ZFW).
Track Point LayerThe Track Point Layer shows vehicles at their last known locations.Each vehicle is represented by an image icon and controlled by three vehicle-related properties: vehicle color, vehicle type, and vehicle retention period.Note that these properties have similar sets of property keys and the property value formats in the file config/TrafficViewer.properties.
Vehicle TypeIcon Description

vtolVertical take-off and landing.Traffic Viewer application provides three groups of vehicle icons, as shown in Table 4.21.Vehicles represented by the icons are headed north, i.e., with a heading of 360°.The layer will rotate the icon based on the heading of a vehicle.In order to support image rotation, vehicle boundary in an icon needs to be rendered within a circle inscribed in the image square.
Vehicle Retention PeriodDurations of the vehicle data to be kept in the application memory are controlled by the vehicle retention period properties as shown in Table 4. 25.The duration values are used by layers to draw vehicle related elements such as vehicle icons, flown paths, and predicted trajectories.4.29 lists the menu items associated with the conflict layer.The menu items let a user show or hide conflict information.All conflict information will be displayed in the initial settings.Note that the order of the tag menu items maps to the order of the conflict tags being displayed.✓ Elapsed Time Shows/hides the elapsed time since the detection time.
Conflict Setting MenuSetting menu on the status bar can be found in the following subsection: 5.6.Conflict Settings ……………………………………………………………………….48
Flight Tag LayerThe Flight Tag Layer draws flight information such as callsign, altitude, groundspeed, and heading.Figure 4.15 shows a screenshot of the flight tag layer demonstrating the tags associated with individual flights.To avoid tag overlapping, the layer employs a quadtree data structure [27] to keep track of the tags being drawn.
Clock LayerThe Clock Layer shows the current simulation time at the bottom-left corner of the view canvas as shown in Figure 4.16.Clicking on the layer menu button will enable or disable the layer.The layer menu is a toggle button and it does not provide additional menu items.
Remote Control LayerThe Remote Control Layer allows basic collaboration among different users within a simulation run, especially for simulations involving physically separated locations such as laboratories.Multiple Traffic Viewer instances may be run in a simulation.For example, instance A is running at Building A and instance B is running at Building B. The two instances can be communicated via the remote control layer.
Remote Control Layer MenuTable 4.31 lists the menu items associated with the remote control layer.Whenever the layer is enabled (disabled by default), Traffic Viewer can be set to either client mode or host mode.A client mode (selected by default) allows the viewer canvas to be controlled by a host.Whenever a user interacts with the host, the viewer canvas publishes the current cursor location, zoom level and map anchor information to all the clients.Only one host is allowed.
Duration LayerThe Duration Layer shows the durations of time spent on drawing each enabled layer.Clicking on the layer menu button will enable or disable the layer.Time required to draw each enabled layer is displayed at the top-right corner of the viewer canvas as shown in Figure 4.17.This is useful for identifying draw performance of individual layers so that code optimization can be applied in order to improve the application response time.The layer menu is a toggle button and it does not provide additional menu items.
Status BarThe Status Bar located at the bottom of the application frame provides information about Traffic Viewer.A status bar consists of a series of graphical user interface widgets as shown in Figure 5.1: (a) zoom level, (b) map settings, (c) boundary settings, (d) range ring settings, (e) flight plan settings, (f) conflict settings, (g) location information, (h) track settings, (i) cursor status, (j) user message, and (k) memory monitor.Clicking on any widget will show a detail panel.

.1. Status barEach status bar button must be a subclass of the abstract class Status Bar Button14 and the subclass requires implementing the two abstract methods listed in Listing 5.1.The status bar buttons can be accessed by pressing and holding a shift key while pressing a number key 1 (to select the first button) through key 0 (to select the last button) on the keyboard.Pressing the space key will show a detail panel.The following sections describe each widget.
Zoom LevelThe Zoom Settings panel allows a user to control the map zoom level.A vertical slider is provided for adjusting the zoom level.Move the slider's knob towards the bottom will increase the zoom level and zoom in the map.On the other hand, move the slider's knob towards the top will decrease the zoom level and zoom out the map. Figure 5.2(a) shows a zoom-in operation by adjusting the knob from zoom level four to zoom level five.Figure 5.2(b) shows a zoom-out operation by adjusting the knob from zoom level four to zoom level three.In addition, the Zoom with Mouse Wheel toggle button allows the user to enable or disable the zoom control via mouse wheel.By default, a user may rotate up/down the mouse wheel to zoom in/out.This feature can be disabled ( ) by deselecting the Zoom with Mouse Wheel button.
Map SettingsThe Map Settings panel allows a user to control map layer related settings.Clicks on the Reset Zoom button resets the map to the initial boundary defined by the two properties boundary_home_min and boundary_home_max (see Section 4.2.1).In addition, two buttons and a horizontal slider are provided for adjusting the brightness of the map tile images.Clicking on the Darker button or moving the slider's knob towards the Darker button will decrease the brightness of the map tiles (see Figure 5.3(a)).On the other hand, clicking on the Brighter button or moving the slider's knob towards the Brighter button will increase the brightness of the map tiles (see Figure 5.3(b)).
Boundary SettingsThe Boundary Settings panel allows a user to control visibility of individual airspace regions.For example, the Oakland ARTCC boundary is made hidden in Figure 5.4(a).Clicking on the Show All button will show all the airspace regions.On the other hand, clicking on the Hide All button will hide all the airspace regions.
Range Ring SettingsThe Range Ring Settings panel allows a user to select and configure the center location of the range rings.Four settings are available:1.The Center location of the range rings setting supports values of latitude/longitude coordinates using a degree-minute-direction format (e.g., 4720N/12216W), a degreeminute-second-direction format (e.g., 472030N/1221645W), or a waypoint name (e.g., KSFO).In addition, a user may use the Cursor Selection button to select the center location by clicking on the map.2. The Integer radius, in nmi, of the first ring from the center setting controls the separation distance of subsequent rings.Note that the radius value must be at least one (1) nmi. 3. The Integer number of rings to be drawn controls how many rings will be shown.Note that the number of rings must be between one (1) and 1000, inclusive.4. The CSV of integer headings, in degrees, for ring radius texts setting controls the location of the distance labels, e.g., 0, 90, 180, 270.
Flight Plan SettingsThe Flight Plan Settings panel provides a capability for users to add or overwrite waypoint definitions at the application runtime.The panel (see Figure 5.5) has a text editor pane that allows a user enter waypoint definitions line by line.Each line is a CSV consisting of the following fields: Positive values are east of the prime meridian (E), and negative values are west of the prime meridian (W).Note that whenever multiple waypoints with the same (case insensitive) airspace name are defined, the last one is used.Empty lines or lines starting with hash (#) symbols are skipped.
Cursor StatusThe Cursor Status panel displays identifiers of the visual elements that are currently selected or locked.A visual element is selected if it is closest to the cursor and its layer has the "cursor" mode enabled.A visual element is locked if a double-click action is performed in a layer with the "cursor" mode enabled.Figure 5.9 shows a screenshot of Traffic Viewer with the cursor mode enabled on the three layers: Flight Plan layer ( ), Flight Path layer ( ), and Track Point layer ( ).The panel also indicates that the flight with callsign N939FE is locked ( ).Double clicking on the viewer canvas toggles the locked and unlocked status.In the locked status, the vehicle remains in the focus even if the cursor is moved.On the other hand, in the unlocked status, the vehicle that is closest to the cursor position is selected whenever the viewer canvas is repainted.
User MessageThe User Message panel allows a user to manually publish sample messages to the Traffic Viewer.This feature is useful for forcing the application to receive and handle the sample messages without creating an external TestBed adapter to publish the sample messages.The sample messages are defined in sample files located in the resource folder $SNTB_HOME/src/main/resources/gov/nasa/sntb/trafficviewer/ui/usermessage/.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.1.Traffic Viewer displays four live data feeds .................................................................Figure 2.1.Initial view of Traffic Viewer: (a) toolbar, (b) viewer canvas, and (c) status bar ........

Figure 1 . 1 .11Figure 1.1.Traffic Viewer displays four live data feeds This Developer's Guide provides instructions for a user to access the Traffic Viewer source code, build the project, configure and run the application.The following sections describe the user interfaces, developer manual and widget details.
Figure 2 .21 shows an initial view of Traffic Viewer on the Mac OS X platform.The application consists of three important widgets: (a) A toolbar provides menu buttons for accessing layer features.(b) A viewer canvas displays traffic and airspace information.(c) A status bar allows a user to control layer settings.

Figure 4.1 illustrates the concept of three enabled layers in Traffic Viewer: The bottommost map layer renders the map tile images, the middle boundary layer renders the airspace boundaries, and the uppermost track point layer renders the flown flight paths.Disabling the map layer will hide the map tile images while the airspace boundaries and the flown flight paths are continuing to show.

Whenever an image with a given dimension is not available in the image set directory, the image will be scaled based on the previous and next available images.For example, at zoom level ten, the vehicle size is 14 × 14 and the image will be scaled based on the image with the dimension 16 × 16.Vehicle icon sizes can be overridden by the user to a value between one and 512 pixels via the Track Settings (see Section 5.8).
Track Point Layer PropertiesTable 4.26 lists the property defined in the track point layer with the name pattern gov.nasa.sntb.trafficviewer.ui.layer.TrackPointLayer.<Name>.This sole property controls the text color of the vehicle count message located at the bottom-left corner of the viewer canvas.4.27 lists the menu items associated with the track point layer.The menu items let a user show or hide vehicle icons that are published from specific data sources.The "cursor" mode, when selected, highlights the vehicle that is closest to the cursor.
Menu Item Description✓ Enabled Enables/disables the track point layer.
CursorIf selected, shows the track point of the vehicle that is closed to the cursor only.All Selects all the data sources.Use this menu item to enable all the data sources.
NoneClears selections of all the data sources.Use this menu item to disable all the data sources.✓ <Data Source> Shows/hides track points that are associated with the data source.
Track Setting MenuSetting menu on the status bar can be found in the following subsection: 5.8.Track Settings …………………………………………………………………............ 49
Conflict LayerThe Conflict Layer draws flight conflicts.A conflict involves two flights and each flight will have its own conflict boundary.Figure 4.14 shows a screenshot of the conflict layer demonstrating a conflict between two vehicles, NASA123 and NASA456.The boundaries of the vehicles are indicated by red circles and the conflict information is included.
Conflict Layer PropertiesTable 4.28 lists the properties defined in the conflict layer with the name pattern gov.nasa.sntb.trafficviewer.ui.layer.ConflictLayer.<Name>.The properties define the colors for the conflict boundaries and the information tags, as well as which information tags are displayed.By default, all information tags are displayed.
Flight Tag Layer MenuTable 4.30 lists the menu items associated with the flight tag layer.The menu items let a user show or hide tags.Callsign, altitude, groundspeed, and heading tags are initially selected.In the "always draw" mode, when selected, all the tags will be drawn on the layer regardless tag overlapping.Note that the order of the tag menu items maps to the order of the flight tags being displayed.
Location InformationThe Location Information panel allows a user to view location specific information based on the current cursor location on the viewer canvas.
Track SettingsThe Track Settings panel allows a user to control the size of the aircraft icons to be rendered on the viewer canvas via a horizontal slider.Dimension of track icon sizes range from one pixel to 512 pixels.This feature is used to enlarge the aircraft icons for better visibility.Listing 5.2 lists the content of the sample file named Track.sample.Dynamic values, enclosed by pairs of macro symbols, ${ and }, can be set at the application runtime.For example, whenever publishing the sample track message, the following macros defined in the message will be replaced with the dynamic values:1. ${latDeg} and ${lonDeg} represent the center geo-location of the viewer canvas.2. ${time} and ${tpub} represent the current system clock time, in milliseconds.Listing 5.2.Default Track.samplefile content { "vid": "NASA123", "latDeg": ${latDeg}, "lonDeg": ${lonDeg}, "altFt": 27000.0,"time": ${time}, "gsKt": 123.45, "crsDeg": 45.0, "vsFpm": -30.0, "meta": { "src": "Sample.1","ver": "2.0a", "tpub": ${tpub} } } Whenever a new message type is supported, please include a sample message file in the resources folder and update the method MessageSampler.getSampleSndem(SndemType) 15.
Memory MonitorThe Memory Monitor mimics the heap status area in the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment for Java Developers [28] displaying the current memory usages.Figure 5.10(a) shows the memory monitor status panel in the Traffic Viewer application.Hovering over the status panel will display a tooltip window with yellow background indicated in Figure 5.10(b).The tooltip window lists the heap size and the current memory usages of the Java Virtual Machine (VM).Right clicking on the status panel will show a popup menu with four commands, shown in Figure 5.10(c), to interact with the memory monitor or to run Garbage Collector (GC):1. Set Mark-marks the current heap usage by drawing a vertical line in the memory monitor area.The previous mark, if set, will be cleared.Left clicking on the memory monitor area will also perform this command.2. Clear Mark-clears the previous mark, if set. 3. Show Max Heap-when selected (deselected by default), scales the width of the memory monitor area using the maximum heap size rather than the total heap size.4. Run GC-runs the garbage collector in the Java VM.The memory monitor is useful for a user to see the memory usage of the application.If memory consumption continues to increase over time, it might indicate a memory leak in the application.In this case, it is important to identify and address the issue.
Shortcut KeysShortcut keys provide a faster way to perform action commands without accessing dropdown menus, pressing toolbar buttons, or clicking status bar buttons.Table 6.1 lists the supported shortcut keys in Traffic Viewer.
