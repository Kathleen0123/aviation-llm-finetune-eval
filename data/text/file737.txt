II. BACKGROUND
A. UAS Well-Clear DefinitionThe second FAA-sponsored Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) Workshop defined SAA as "the capability of a UAS to remain well clear from, and avoid collisions with, other airborne traffic" [5].The current study uses the term "detect and avoid" (DAA) instead of SAA because the UAS community in the United States transitioned to using DAA after the publication of the workshop report with no change in meaning.The UAS Executive Committee Science and Research Panel in the United States coordinated research efforts by NASA, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, and the United States Air Force Research Laboratory to develop a quantitative definition of well clear for UAS [6].Several well clear definition candidates for UAS were evaluated by a variety of methods, including an approach based on the safety risk of the relative geometry between UAS and other aircraft [7].Based on the results of these analyses, a well clear definition for UAS was recommended to RTCA SC-228 and the FAA.After incorporating feedback from both institutions, a consensus in the United States on the definition of well clear for UAS was reached.By this definition, a loss of DAA well clear (LoWC)-which is different than the subjective loss of "well clear"-is an event in which a UAS is in close proximity with another aircraft such that the following three conditions are concurrently true [1]:      Figure 1 illustrates the variables and parameters used to define well clear for UAS, each of which will be described in detail in this section.The asterisked parameters are thresholds and the non-asterisked variables are measured or projected values.The dashed objects are projections of the aircraft.This schematic illustrates an encounter between a UAS flying level heading east and a manned aircraft flying level heading west.The UAS well clear definition uses a spatial threshold in the vertical dimension known as * h d to which the current vertical separation is compared (21 h d h h ).The LoWC definition also utilizes a spatial metric in the horizontal dimension known as the horizontal miss distance (HMD), which is the projected separation in the horizontal dimension at the predicted close point of approach (CPA) using linear extrapolation in the horizontal dimension: In the example illustrated in Figure 1 and described in the paragraph above it, HMD is the cross-track distance between the UAS and the manned aircraft because the former is flying due east while the latter is flying due west.The UAS well clear definition also uses a temporal separation metric known as "modified tau" ( mod  ) that estimates the time to CPA between two aircraft.Modified tau is adopted from the collision detection logic of TCAS II (also simply called "TCAS" throughout the rest of this paper) [8].Modified tau is based on the concept of "tau" (  ), which is calculated as the ratio of slant range ( r ) between two aircraft to their slant range rate ( r ) and measured in seconds (sec): As described in the TCAS II Manual [9], one issue with the tau metric is that the calculated tau can be large even when the physical separation between two aircraft is small if the rate of closure is low (e.g., two aircraft flying at about the same speed, on the same heading, and offset by a small distance).In situations like this, the calculated tau value does not assure adequate separation because a sudden trajectory change that increases the closure rate (e.g., a turn) may cause LoWC.To provide protection for these types of situations, a modified alerting threshold referred to as "modified tau" was developed for use in TCAS II.Modified tau utilizes a parameter known as "distance modification" (DMOD) to provide a minimum threat range boundary encircling the ownship aircraft.In TCAS II, modified tau ( mod_ r  ) is calculated using slant range ( r ) and slant range rate ( r ).By comparison, during the second FAA-sponsored SAA Workshop [5], it was decided that modified tau ( mod  ) in the UAS DAA well clear definition be calculated based on horizontal range (                  
B. DAA Warning DefinitionThe DAA Warning alert definition in this study uses the same types of parameters and has the same form as the UAS well clear definition.A buffer of about 0.09 nautical miles (nmi) was added to the UAS well clear DMOD and HMD * thresholds of 4000 ft to model what a DAA system might use to guard against the effects of uncertainty.The modified tau and current vertical separation thresholds of 35 sec and 450 ft, respectively, are the same as in the UAS well clear definition.In the simulations conducted for this study, DAA Warning alerts were issued when the following set of conditions was predicted to occur within 40 seconds, which is the sum of the 25-second minimum average time of alert for the Hazard Zone of DAA Warning alerts [1] and a 15-second buffer that a DAA system might use to guard against the effects of uncertainty:
C. TCASThis study utilized TCAS II version 7.1 software tailored with a convenient interface to integrate into different testing platforms.It computes Proximate Traffic messages, traffic advisories (TAs), and resolution advisories (RAs).This study focuses specifically on TCAS RAs, especially with regard to when they are issued relative to when the CA region is crossed, if ever.The spatial and temporal thresholds used by TCAS II are listed in Table I. (See [9] for additional details.)The tau thresholds listed in Table I are for both modified tau and vertical tau ( v  ).The latter is defined as: 21 where Note that is positive when aircraft are convergingh v rh rh v d v v h h    
D. Collision Avoidance Region Definition CandidatesUAS are projected to interact with manned aircraft on a regular basis [10], [11], [12].In fact, the latter study estimated that UAS and manned VFR aircraft could experience LoWC separation at an unacceptable rate of about once every 50 UAS flight hours in the absence of mitigations such as those provided by UAS DAA systems.In safety-critical situations like LoWC and near mid-air collision (NMAC) when UAS are in close proximity with manned aircraft, interoperability between UAS DAA systems and manned aircraft collision avoidance systems is essential as shown in [2].This study was the basis for the inclusion in the RTCA SC-228 preliminary draft MOPS [3] of a Collision Avoidance (CA) Region within which UAS DAA vertical guidance is restricted if the UAS does not have Vertical RA Complement (VRC) data (e.g., "do not climb") from the manned aircraft's collision avoidance system.To prevent the UAS from maneuvering to maintain or regain DAA well clear in a way that could be incompatible with the manned aircraft's collision avoidance maneuver in this situation, UAS DAA guidance is restricted in two ways: 1) no vertical altitude guidance is provided, and 2) no vertical speed guidance beyond the current vertical speed ± 500 ft/min is provided.The collision avoidance region must be sufficiently large to encompass all geometries that would trigger a TCAS RA (i.e., the TCAS RA region).That is, UAS and manned aircraft must always enter the CA region prior to any TCAS RAs issued by manned aircraft onboard collision avoidance systems in line with the interoperability principles described in [4] and [13].However, the CA region also should not be so large as to limit DAA vertical guidance unnecessarily at DAA Warning alerts when aircraft are further apart.Three CA region definition candidates were evaluated in this paper.The "AND" collision avoidance region definition in the preliminary RTCA SC-228 draft MOPS [3] was developed based on research presented at ATM2015 [2].In addition, two alternative definitions ("OR" and "OR-h") were developed in this study based on careful study of the definitions of TCAS RA (Section II.C) and DAA alerting (Section II.B).All three CA region definition candidates were evaluated in terms of how well they achieved the competing dual interoperability objectives described in the prior paragraph.v v h h vh dd DMOD d             
III. EXPERIMENT SETUP
A. Encounter SetThe three collision avoidance region definition candidates were evaluated on 1.3 million pairwise encounters between UAS and manned aircraft simulated using NASA's Java Architecture for DAA Extensibility and Modeling [14] that cover all combinations of the parameters in Table II.This encounter set is appropriate for this study on interoperability between UAS DAA systems and manned aircraft collision avoidance systems because it encompasses a wide range of horizontal and vertical closure rates, angles, and miss distances that could occur in the airspace.The combinatorial approach was utilized because it naturally captures the rare "corner cases" that may not occur on a regular basis in the airspace.In each encounter, the UAS was simulated flying level at altitude 5000 ft heading north.The UAS ground speeds ranged between 50 and 200 kts to cover the expected performance range of UAS aircraft.To span the range of possible encounter situations, manned aircraft flying level as well as manned aircraft descending and manned aircraft climbing at vertical speeds up to 2000 ft/min were simulated (Figure 2).The manned aircraft were simulated flying at speeds between 50 and 250 kts in encounters at a wide range of angles relative to the UAS from the front, rear, and sides (Figure 3).Encounters were simulated with CPA distances from 0 nmi horizontally and 0 ft vertically up through 1.5 nmi horizontally and 1000 ft vertically (Figure 4 and Figure 5).Lastly, guidance information for the UAS aircraft using different trial plan turn rates and climb and descent rates was also collected.
B. Simulation FeaturesAll encounters were simulated without uncertainty and without mitigations performed by either UAS or manned aircraft to ensure that the sequences of DAA Warning alerts, collision avoidance region crossings, and TCAS RAs were entirely determined by encounter geometries.This is suitable for identifying and resolving the major interoperability issues between UAS DAA systems and manned aircraft collision avoidance systems.However, higher-fidelity simulations with realistic surveillance, sensor, and tracker models, DAA mitigations (as in [15]), and/or collision avoidance mitigations are needed to investigate any remaining interoperability issues and research other aspects of DAA systems (e.g., alerting).
C. Interoperability MetricsThis study evaluates the three collision avoidance region definition candidates in terms of their interoperability with TCAS RAs and DAA Warning alerts.More specifically, this study analyzes when collision avoidance region thresholds are crossed (if ever) relative to when TCAS RAs and DAA Warning alerts are issued (if ever).The interoperability of the collision avoidance region with TCAS RAs is the most important consideration because this is when UAS and manned aircraft are in closest proximity and safety is most critical.
1) Interoperability between the Collision Avoidance Region and TCAS Resolution AdvisoriesIt is essential that vertical guidance provided by the UAS DAA system be restricted to prevent conflicts with TCAS RAs issued by the manned aircraft's TCAS system.To do this, the CA region threshold must always be crossed before a TCAS RA is issued.There should not be any encounters in which a TCAS RA is issued before the CA region threshold is crossed, and there also should not be any cases in which a TCAS RA is issued but the CA region threshold is never crossed.CA region definition candidates that allow these undesirable situations to occur are unacceptable.The corresponding metrics to evaluate collision avoidance region definition candidates are:1. Out of the encounters in which a TCAS RA is issued, the percentage with a TCAS RA issued before the CA region is crossed 2. Out of the encounters in which a TCAS RA is issued, the percentage without the CA region ever being crossed The denominator for both of these metrics is the number of encounters in which TCAS RA is issued: 343,100.This was the same for each CA region definition candidate because all simulated encounters were unmitigated (i.e., no maneuvers).
2) Interoperability between the Collision Avoidance Region and DAA Warning AlertsAs a secondary objective, the CA region should not be so large as to limit DAA vertical guidance unnecessarily at DAA Warning alerts.Ideally, there would not be any cases in which the CA region is crossed before a DAA Warning alert is issued.In addition, a DAA Warning alert ideally would always be issued before the CA region is crossed.However, since UAS and manned aircraft have greater separation at the time that DAA Warning alerts are issued than at the time that TCAS RAs are issued, the corresponding metrics do not necessarily have to be 0% and 100%, respectively:1. Out of the encounters in which the CA region is crossed, the percentage with the CA region crossed before a DAA Warning alert is issued 2. Out of the encounters in which a DAA Warning alert is issued, the percentage with a DAA Warning alert issued before the CA region is crossed These two metrics are used to decide between CA region definition candidates that do not allow either of the undesirable interoperability situations between the CA region and TCAS RAs (Figure 6) to occur.The denominator for the first of these metrics is the number of encounters in which the CA region is crossed, which varies by CA region definition candidate.This number was 829,380 for the "AND" definition, 1,113,180 for the "OR" definition, and 1,194,080 for the "OR-h" definition.On the other hand, the denominator for the second of these metrics is the number of encounters with a DAA Warning alert, which was the same for each CA region definition candidate because all simulated encounters were unmitigated (i.e., no maneuvers): 719,280.
3) SummaryTable III summarizes the set of undesirable and desirable interoperability situations analyzed in this paper.The first two rows are the undesirable interoperability situations illustrated in Figure 6 that correspond to the primary interoperability objective for the CA region to be large enough to encompass all geometries that lead to TCAS RA on the manned aircraft (*).The other rows of Table III correspond to the competing secondary interoperability objective illustrated in Figure 7 for the CA region to not be so large as to limit DAA vertical guidance unnecessarily at DAA Warning alert (**).
IV. RESULTSThe first two interoperability metrics in Table III are the most important for evaluating the three collision avoidance region definitions (Section IV.A): 1) the percentage of encounters with a TCAS RA in which the CA region was crossed after a TCAS RA was issued, and 2) the percentage of encounters with a TCAS RA in which the CA region was never crossed.These metrics capture the most safety-critical situations when the UAS and manned aircraft were in closest proximity such that the vertical guidance provided by the UAS DAA system must not conflict with RAs issued by the manned aircraft's TCAS system.Any CA region definition for which one or both of these metrics are greater than zero is not suitable.After excluding all unsuitable CA region definition candidates, the remaining ones are evaluated (Section IV.B) in terms of having the lowest value for the last undesirable metric in Table III and the highest value overall for the desirable metric in Table III.
A. Results Invalidating the "AND" Collision Avoidance Region DefinitionTable IV shows the prevalence of encounter situations with undesirable events for each CA region definition candidate.The most important difference between them is that the "AND" definition is the only one with the highly undesirable cases in which a TCAS RA was issued before the CA region was crossed or a TCAS RA was issued without the CA region ever being crossed (first two rows of the "AND" column in Table IV).Based on these results, the "AND" CA region definition certainly should not be used in DAA systems since it does not encompass all geometries that trigger TCAS RAs.The "AND" definition could allow for UAS DAA vertical guidance that is incompatible with manned aircraft TCAS RAs.By comparison, these undesirable cases never occurred when using the "OR" CA region definition or the "OR-h" CA region definition (the 0% values in Table IV).Since the results in this section indicate that the "AND" collision avoidance region definition is unsuitable for DAA systems, Section IV.B will only compare the performance of the "OR" and "OR-h" CA region definitions.The one with the highest overall interoperability with manned aircraft TCAS RAs and UAS DAA Warning alerts was recommended to RTCA SC-228.However, before delving into that analysis, the two most frequent types of encounter geometries which disqualified the "AND" CA region definition from contention are illustrated and discussed next.
1) Investigation of the most prevalent encounter geometry in which a TCAS RA was issued before the CA region was crossedOne type of encounter geometry was most prevalent among the cases in which a TCAS RA was issued on the manned aircraft before the "AND" CA region was crossed.In this situation, the two aircraft were separated vertically between 420 ft and 600 ft, which was close enough to trigger a TCAS RA on the manned aircraft.However, since the manned aircraft was converging vertically toward the UAS at a slow rate of 500 ft/min, UAS DAA vertical guidance was not restricted when using the "AND" definition of the CA region because the vertical tau exceeded the 50-second maximum threshold.Figure 8 illustrates one representative example in which vertical tau was 71 sec because the manned aircraft was 592 ft above the UAS and descending toward the UAS at a rate of 500 ft/min.The two aircraft were sufficiently close both spatially and temporally to trigger a TCAS RA on the manned aircraft.However, the "AND" CA region was not crossed because the vertical tau of 71 sec was greater than the 50second maximum threshold.On the other hand, the "OR" and "OR-h" CA regions were crossed in this zero horizontal separation case.With regard to the former, the modified tau of 0 sec was less than its maximum threshold of 50 sec and the vertical separation at CPA of 0 ft was less than its maximum threshold of 800 ft.With regard to the latter, the modified tau of 0 sec was less than its maximum threshold of 50 sec and the current vertical separation of 592 ft was less than its maximum threshold of 800 ft. 2) Investigation of the most prevalent encounter geometry in which a TCAS RA was issued without the CA region ever being crossed One type of encounter geometry was most prevalent among the cases in which a TCAS RA was issued without the "AND" CA region ever being crossed.In this situation, the UAS and the manned aircraft were both flying level and separated vertically by less than 600 ft, which was close enough for the manned aircraft's TCAS system to issue an RA.However, since the vertical closure rate was zero, vertical tau was undefined and, thus, the "AND" CA region was never crossed.Figure 9 illustrates one representative example in which vertical tau was undefined because the UAS and the manned aircraft were both flying level at altitude 5000 ft with vertical rate of 0 ft/min.The two aircraft were close enough both spatially and temporally to trigger a TCAS RA on the manned aircraft, but the "AND" CA region was never crossed because vertical tau was undefined since the vertical closure rate was zero.On the other hand, both the "OR" and the "OR-h" CA regions were crossed because the vertical separation at CPA of 0 ft ("OR") and the current vertical separation of 0 ft ("OR-h") were both less than their respective 800-ft maximum thresholds in addition to the modified tau of 2.4 sec being less than their 50-sec maximum thresholds.
B. Results Supporting the "OR-h" Collision Avoidance Region DefinitionThis section compares the results for the "OR" and "OR-h" CA region definitions in terms of their interoperability with UAS DAA Warning alerts.The first result discussed is the prevalence of encounters in which the CA region was crossed before a DAA Warning alert was issued.In these undesirable situations, the CA region was overly large and DAA vertical guidance for the UAS would have been restricted unnecessarily at DAA Warning alerts even though the UAS and manned aircraft were outside of the safety-critical TCAS RA region.As seen in the bottom row of Table IV in Section IV.A, this metric is more than 20 percentage points lower for the "OR-h" definition than for the "OR" definition.This result supports using the "OR-h" CA region definition for UAS DAA systems because it had a lower degree of non-interoperability with DAA Warning alerts.One type of encounter geometry was most prevalent among the cases in which the "OR-h" CA region was not crossed prior to a DAA Warning alert, but the "OR" CA region was crossed prior to a DAA Warning alert.In this situation, the "OR-h" CA region was not crossed even though modified tau was less than 50 sec because the UAS and manned aircraft were vertically separated by at least 800 ft and the rate of vertical convergence was slow enough that vertical tau was greater than 50 sec.However, the "OR" CA region was crossed because the vertical convergence rate was fast enough that the predicted vertical separation at horizontal CPA was less than 800 ft.Figure 10 illustrates one representative example in which the "OR" CA region was crossed because the modified tau of 49.5 sec and the predicted vertical separation at horizontal CPA of 0 ft were both less than their respective maximum thresholds of 50 sec and 800 ft.There was no DAA Warning alert at this time instance since the vertical separation between the two aircraft was predicted to be more than 450 ft for the entire DAA alerting 40-second look-ahead time horizon.DAA Warning alerts were issued later on as the aircraft converged.The "OR-h" CA region was not crossed at this time because the vertical tau of 61 sec and the current vertical separation of 2033 ft both exceeded their respective maximum thresholds of 50 sec and 800 ft.The next analysis in this section is the prevalence of encounters with the desirable situation of the CA region being crossed after a DAA Warning alert was issued.In these cases, the CA region was not so large that DAA vertical guidance for the UAS would have been restricted unnecessarily at DAA Warning alerts.Although the results for all three CA region definitions are included in Table V for completeness, only the results for the "OR" and "OR-h" definitions are compared because the results in Table IV of Section IV.A already disqualified the "AND" definition from contention.As seen in Table V, the metric is more than 30 percentage points higher when using the "OR-h" definition than when using the "OR" definition.This result supports using the "OR-h" CA region definition for UAS DAA systems because it had a higher degree of interoperability with DAA Warning alerts.
C. SummaryThree CA region definition candidates were evaluated on 1.3 million simulated pairwise encounters between UAS and manned aircraft for a wide range of vertical and horizontal closure rates, angles, and miss distances.The "AND" CA region definition was determined to be unsuitable since it did not encompass all encounter geometries that triggered TCAS RAs-primarily those with slow (e.g., 500 ft/min) or zero vertical closure rates.The "AND" CA region definition could allow for UAS DAA vertical guidance that is incompatible with manned aircraft TCAS RAs, which is unacceptable.Between the "OR" and "OR-h" CA region definitions, the other interoperability metrics indicated that the latter had a lower degree of non-interoperability and a higher degree of interoperability with DAA Warning alerts.Based on the results of this study, the "OR-h" collision avoidance region definition was recommended to RTCA SC-228 at its July 2016 meeting and accepted for use in the MOPS for UAS DAA systems [1].
V. DISCUSSION
A. State-Based Collision Avoidance Region ParametersThe data analysis results in Section IV indicate that the "OR-h" definition of the collision avoidance region has the lowest degree of non-interoperability and the highest degree of interoperability with regard to TCAS II Resolution Advisories and DAA Warning alerts.However, it may be possible to improve the interoperability of the "OR-h" CA region definition by making its threshold values state-based as in TCAS II instead of using constant values in all situations.A set of altitude-based vertical separation threshold values for the "OR-h" CA region definition is proposed in this section for follow-up research.The primary constraint is that each threshold value must be at least as large as its TCAS II RA counterpart to ensure safety.Using state-based threshold values for other conditions and parameters such as modified tau, vertical tau, and DMOD could also improve the interoperability of the "OR-h" CA region definition with manned aircraft TCAS RAs and DAA Warning alerts.The "OR-h" definition of the CA region utilizes a constant vertical separation threshold value of 800 ft in all situations.This led to undesirable cases in which the UAS and the manned aircraft crossed into the "OR-h" CA region prior to DAA Warning alert, such as when they were horizontally converging with modified tau less than 50 sec, vertically separated by at least 450 ft but less than 800 ft, and vertically diverging.In this case, they were in the "OR-h" CA region.However, there was no DAA Warning alert because its current vertical separation condition was never satisfied.Using the smaller, altitude-based TCAS II vertical separation threshold values in Table VI in the current vertical separation condition of the "OR-h" CA region definition could prevent a subset of these undesirable situations from occurring.
B. Suitability of Suppressing Vertical Guidance for Non-Cooperative Manned AircraftThis study investigated a method of suppressing UAS DAA vertical guidance to ensure interoperability with the collision avoidance systems of cooperative (i.e., transponder-equipped) manned aircraft.RTCA SC-228 also identified that it may be necessary at times to suppress UAS DAA vertical guidance in encounters with non-cooperative manned aircraft, which do not have an onboard collision avoidance system by definition.In this scenario, the UAS can only utilize its radar system to track and estimate the state and projected path of non-cooperative manned aircraft.This can lead to significant errors, particularly when estimating vertical speed.This is especially problematic when determining how to regain DAA well clear separation since a poor maneuver choice could potentially result in midair collision between the UAS and the non-cooperative manned aircraft.Research is necessary to determine the circumstances under which suppressing DAA vertical guidance is necessary as well as the situations in which allowing DAA vertical guidance is beneficial (e.g., when the UAS is capable of maneuvering vertically at a faster rate than the propagation of its radar errors).
VI. CONCLUSIONSDAA systems enable UAS to remain well clear of other aircraft, some of which are manned aircraft equipped with a collision avoidance system.In the United States, private industry, government, and academia worked together in RTCA SC-228 to develop MOPS for UAS DAA systems.A safetycritical aspect of this work was ensuring that UAS DAA systems never provide guidance that is incompatible with manned aircraft collision avoidance RAs.As part of this effort, this paper investigated three candidate definitions for a spatialtemporal "collision avoidance region" in which UAS DAA vertical guidance is restricted to preclude interoperability issues with manned aircraft collision avoidance RAs.Three collision avoidance region definitions were evaluated on 1.3 million simulated pairwise encounters between UAS and manned aircraft that spanned a wide range of horizontal and vertical closure rates, angles, and miss distances which could occur.One definition was disqualified because it was not large enough to prevent incompatible UAS DAA vertical guidance from ever being provided in safety-critical situations in which manned aircraft TCAS II systems issued vertical RAs.The two most prevalent types of encounter geometries in these cases involved either slow (e.g., -500 ft/min) or zero vertical closure rates between the UAS and manned aircraft.Of the remaining two CA region definition candidates, the one with both the lowest degree of non-interoperability and the highest degree of interoperability with DAA alerts was recommended to RTCA SC-228.By this definition, two aircraft are in the collision avoidance region and UAS DAA vertical guidance is restricted when the time to closest point of approach (modified tau) is less than 50 seconds and either the time to co-altitude (vertical tau) is less than 50 seconds or the current vertical separation is less than 800 feet.TCAS II experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Lincoln Laboratory and the MITRE Corporation in the United States reviewed the research findings and concurred with the recommendation.RTCA SC-228 accepted the recommended collision avoidance region definition for use in its MOPS for UAS DAA systems to ensure interoperability between UAS detect-and-avoid and manned aircraft collision avoidance.in x-dimension ry v relative horizontal velocity in y-dimension mod  horizontal modified tau INTRODUCTION

The "AND" definition of the collision avoidance regionhas a form like the DAA alerting definition (Section II.B)that connects all conditions by "AND" operators. It doesnot fully encompass the TCAS RA region, though, sincethe two vertical conditions are connected by an "AND"operator instead of an "OR" operator (verified by TCAS IIexperts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Lincoln Laboratory and the MITRE Corporation in theUnited States):
