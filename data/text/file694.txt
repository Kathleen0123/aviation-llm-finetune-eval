Airspace ComplexityThe capacity of airspace is limited by the controller's ability to perform the tasks to maintain a safe system.The controller's ability to perform the tasks depends on the combination of traffic, procedures, tools, and mental models used to perform the tasks.Currently, the capacity of a sector is measured in terms of the maximum number of aircraft that can be accommodated in a sector, a quantity referred to as Monitor Alert Parameter.The traffic load in a sector is maintained at a level below the capacity of the airspace.Although easy to measure and understand, MAP is not a satisfactory measure of capacity.It has been suggested by the Radio Technical Commission on Aeronautics [1] that the monitor/alert function should be extended to include measures of sector complexity and controller workload.These measures should be based not only on the number of aircraft, but their relation to each other, airspace geometry and varying traffic flow conditions.This concept has come to be known as "dynamic density."It is also referred to as airspace complexity [3][4][5].Research on dynamic density relates traffic complexity factors, such as number of aircraft, aircraft separation and others, to controller workload.Researchers have identified dynamic density measures of complexity that correlate well with workload in studied sectors with prevalent procedures [1][2].It has been argued that traffic pattern is a significant factor in a controller's cognitive ability [4].As described later in the paper, published models derived in specific studies do not correlate well with each other and, hence, the generality of these measures beyond studied sectors seems to be in doubt.Dynamic density research identifies factors that contribute to the structural or traffic complexity of the situation.Recently, there have been efforts to generate simplified measures of airspace complexity [13].These models use the principal components of earlier airspace complexity metrics.Three airspace complexity measures are used in this paper.The first utilizes airspace complexity, C1, as described in [2].C1 is a linear function of the number of aircraft in the sector (N), number of aircraft with heading change (NH), number of aircraft with speed change (NS), number of aircraft with altitude change (NA) and number of aircraft with horizontal and vertical proximity parameters (S5, S10, S25, S40 and S70).Airspace complexity is a linear combination of the above factors, i.e.,C1 = W 1 •N + W 2 •NH + W 3 •NS + W 4 •NA +W 5 •S5 + W 6 •S10 + W 7 •S25 + W 8 •S40 + W 9 •S70.The weights, (W1,…,W9) were validated in a real-time operational environment based on the input from a large group of controllers.The second airspace complexity function, C2, is a simplified version of [3] based on the components that contribute the most to that measure: aircraft density (AD1), number of aircraft close to sector boundary (BPR), number of aircraft in the sector (N) and sector volume (SVOL).Although C2 does not correlate well with C1, the principal components of C2, namely, AD1, BPR, N and SVOL correlate well with C1 with an r-squared value of .87.A third complexity function was computed by calibrating AD1, BPR, N and SVOL using C1.With new weights, this function, C3, is used as the third complexity metric.The traffic situation in ZDC32, a sector in Washington Center and one of the busiest sectors in the country, was examined every minute for five days in 2006.A careful examination of the data resulted in 5744 aircraft configurations.The values of C1, C2, C3 and N were computed for each of these configurations.Figure 1 shows the distribution of the sector counts and the three complexity metrics for these traffic conditions.The distributions in Figure 1 are normalized and their critical values are shown in Table 1.The complexity metrics have a Poisson-like distribution.Thus, with C1 complexity measure, maximum complexity value in the data is 141.The value at 95 th percentile was 82.Thus, most traffic situations are not necessarily complex.The complexity function C2 results in negative values for certain aircraft configurations.The negative values are not meaningful and result from the inapplicability of certain complexity functions under all conditions.Dynamic density and its principal components, although not precise, are good indicators of sector controller activity.For dynamic density to be useful, one should be able to predict its behavior.Since dynamic density is a function of the position and velocity of all aircraft in a sector, a trajectory prediction algorithm can be used to predict dynamic density.The trajectory-based models predict sector demand and dynamic density adequately for short durations of up to twenty minutes.However, there are significant sources of error for predictions in the range of two hours.The accuracy of these predictions is impacted by aircraft modeling errors, lack of flight intent information, and departure and weather uncertainties [14][15].
Forecasting ComplexityThe forecasting of dynamic density requires accurate position and velocity for all of the aircraft.As predicting even the correct sector count is hard, it is unreasonable to expect such information based on the current position and velocity of the aircraft and flight plan information.However, it is possible to predict the mean number of aircraft expected for a prediction interval of two hours based on historical data [16].Assuming the mean sector count still leaves many possible configurations for the same number of aircraft.The paper uses a six step approach: (a) To emphasize the impact of errors in congested sectors, select one of the busiest sectors in the U.S. national airspace on days with high delay, (b) select traffic configurations with the mean number of aircraft expected for the prediction interval, (c) perturb the configurations by infusing one, two or three additional aircraft to the configurations and re-compute the airspace complexity metric, (d) group situations where the addition of a single aircraft increases complexity significantly, (e) identify interior regions and boundaries of the sector with significant impact, and (f) characterize the worst case impact locations.The approach thus aims to provide information of practical value.In general, the new aircraft can sometimes be an unscheduled flight (popup) that may appear at interior points or more often a re-routed or delayed aircraft that appears at sector boundaries.These cases will be studied separately.The approach described earlier is examined using ZDC32 as an example in the next Section and provides insights into the impact of poor forecasting on complexity.This is followed by a Section that discusses application of the approach to another sector in Indianapolis Center demonstrating the general applicability of this approach.
Results for Washington Center Sector ZDC32For simplicity, results presented in the rest of this paper utilize just one of these complexity measures, C1.Similar analysis can be conducted for measures C2, C3 and others.As described earlier, traffic situations in ZDC32, a sector in Washington Center, were examined by the introduction of additional aircraft.ZDC32 is a high altitude sector in Washington Center.The primary function of ZDC is the separation of en route traffic and the sequencing of arrivals and departures of aircraft for the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area, the New York Metropolitan Area, and Philadelphia.The traffic situation in ZDC32 was examined for an additional six days for a total of eleven days in 2006.A list of locations where aircraft appear in ZDC32 was created and the resultant data consisted of 6550 aircraft configurations.Even though the exact aircraft configuration cannot be predicted as discussed earlier, it is instructive to examine the impact on a specific configuration.The final results in the paper are based on examining a good cross-section of all possible aircraft configurations.Therefore, the next subsection discusses the impact of a new aircraft on Dynamic Density of a specific aircraft configuration.This discussion is followed by the impact of additional aircraft as the number of aircraft in the configuration varies from a small number to MAP value.To study the impact of an additional aircraft on complexity, first consider a specific configuration with a given number of aircraft.Figure 2 shows the aircraft configuration in ZDC32 at 18:14 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on July 21, 2006.The C1 complexity value for this fourteen aircraft configuration is .73.The airspace complexity of ZDC32 was varied by the introduction of an additional aircraft at 18:14 GMT.It was found that the increase in complexity depends critically on the location of the new aircraft.To study the relation of the increase in complexity with location, the sector was divided into equal intervals in altitude, latitude and longitude.A new aircraft was introduced at each of these locations and the C1 complexity of the resulting fifteen aircraft configuration was computed in each case.For simplicity, the new aircraft was assumed to be flying at the cruise speed and in level flight.This simplification results in a small error in the absolute values and with little impact on the conclusions.The location of the 15 th aircraft corresponding to the maximum of the C1 values provides the aircraft location with the most impact on C1 complexity.Figure 3 shows the contour of aircraft positions (shown in red color), which increase the C1 airspace complexity measure from .73 to .96. Figure 4 shows two aircraft locations (shown in red) that increase C1 to a maximum value of 1.0.The figures show that the locations of the new aircraft where the increase in complexity is the worst are close to aircraft clusters.
Impact of an Additional Aircraft on a Specific Configuration
Impact of an Unexpected Popup AircraftThe previous section identified the contours of positions of worst complexity impact when the exact positions of the aircraft are known.The need for accurate position and speed information is modified in this section by assuming that the expected number of aircraft is known and the actual number may vary by as much as three additional aircraft.For N-aircraft configurations, the approach described in the Section on Forecasting Complexity was used to characterize the impact of new aircraft.Table 2 shows the location of the new aircraft that increases the C1 complexity to its maximum value for different initial values of the number of aircraft in the sector.The data used had aircraft configurations varying from 4 to 18. MAP value for this sector is 18.The complexity of an aircraft configuration with 18 aircraft shown in the Figure 5 had the worst value of 141.All reported values are normalized with respect to this complexity value.The first row in the table describes the impact in the case of fifteen aircraft configurations.In these configurations, the worst-case impact takes place at latitude of 36.8 and a longitude of -79.2 with the value of increase to be 0.21.Thus, .21means that absolute value is 21% of the observed maximum value in the dataset.
Figure 5. Most Complex Observed ConfigurationThe maximum complexity value of observed fifteen aircraft configuration is .94.Thus, the overall complexity after adding an aircraft in worst situation can reach as high as 1.15.The resultant situation can be 15% more complex than the worst situation observed in real data.This is clearly not a desirable situation.The second to fifth rows in the table lists entries for 14, 12, 8 and 4 aircraft.The last row lists results when all configurations are considered without limiting these to a specific number of aircraft in the configuration.If the number of aircraft in configurations considered is larger, then the corresponding worst-case impact is larger as well.As evident from the table, the situation resulting when one aircraft is added to 4, 8, or 12 aircraft configurations is of less concern as the worst complexity after adding an aircraft remains below 1.Most of the time, number of aircraft in a sector will be well below MAP value as can be seen in Figure 1.d and hence, the appearance of an unexpected aircraft does not result in excessive workload.While the points of worst impact in the Table 2 vary in latitude from 36.4 to 37 and in longitude from -79.2 to -79.7 depending on how many aircraft are in the configuration, all are in the neighborhood of each other.Also, these happen to be in the region with highest aircraft density where two major flows in ZDC32 intersect.Figure 6 below shows ZDC32 with the overall worst impact point as a small black rectangle.Visually, one can see that this is in the region of the intersection of two major flows in the sector.One may also identify the worst impacted region.Figure 6 also shows a contour plot with 80 th percentile values of impact on complexity.Again, this region is centered on the intersection of major flows.While popup aircraft and late departure aircraft can appear at interior points in the sector, rerouted new aircraft are more likely to appear at sector borders.Therefore, an attempt was made to identify border segments, where an unexpected aircraft would make the worst impact.This was done by creating four boundary regions at ten flight levels, altitudes at intervals of 1000 feet, in ZDC32.The flight levels were selected in the range 24,000 to 33,000 feet.The four regions are shown as B1, B2, B3 and B4 in Figure 7.The worst possible impact varies significantly depending on the boundary.The variation is illustrated using two borders: (1) B1 at 31000 feet and (2) B4 at 25000 feet.While average probability of an aircraft entering at any of the forty boundaries in 10 flight levels is 2.5%, these are 5% for B1 at 31,000 feet and 1% for B4 at 25,000 feet.
Figure 6. Worst Impact Contours for ZDC32
Impact of an Unexpected Aircraft at Sector BoundariesAs can be see from Table 3, for configurations with aircraft less than fifteen, the worst-case impact does not matter much as the worst-case complexity is already low.For aircraft configurations with fifteen aircraft, the boundary B1 at altitude 31,000 feet had an increase in complexity of 0.21, whereas the boundary B4 at altitude 25,000 feet had an increase in complexity of 0.05.Thus, there is significant variation in the impact on the complexity depending on the region of entry of the aircraft.
Impact of More Than One Unexpected AircraftThe analysis for the impact of an additional aircraft on complexity can be repeated in the event that the actual number of aircraft in the prediction interval of interest is off by two or three aircraft from the expected mean number of aircraft.The positions of worst impact at interior points are very similar to the single aircraft case.However, as can be seen from Table 4, the magnitude of the impact of introducing 2nd or 3rd aircraft is higher than in single aircraft case.If both the first and second aircraft appear at the worst positions, then the overall increase would be 0.25 + 0.29 = 0.54.Just as B1 at 31,000 feet is the worst boundary for a single new aircraft as compared to B4 at 24,000 feet, it is also the worst boundary in the case of a second or a third new aircraft.Second or third aircraft appearing at B1 at 31,000 feet has worse impact as compared to a second or third aircraft appearing at B4 at 25,000 feet.The exact impact value is slightly worse than the impact value in the case of a single aircraft.Table 4 shows these values.
Results for ZID81To examine the generality of the approach, this methodology was applied to another sector in Indianapolis Center.ZID81 is a high altitude sector in the southwest corner of Indianapolis Center.It deals with en route traffic and departures from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Detroit (DTW) airports The MAP value is seventeen.The three major flows in the sector are (1) east-west flights between Cincinnati and Saint Louis, (2) flights between Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee airports to Florida destinations and (3) over-flights between Texas and Tennessee to east coast destinations.The intersection of the three major flows is shown in the Fig. 8.The red contour in the figure indicates the 80 th percentile of complexity.The worst impact point at interior locations, shown as an asterisk in Fig. 8, centers on latitude of 37.90 and longitude of -87.80 and is near the point of intersection of three major flows.Like in the case of ZDC32, the impact of a new aircraft entering a sector at boundary depends on the entry boundary.Figure 9 shows four boundaries of the sector.The differential impact between boundaries can be illustrated with two boundaries, B3 at 31,000 feet and B1 at 28,000 feet.The probability of an aircraft entering B3 at FL310 is 12% whereas the probability of an aircraft entering B1 at 28,000 feet is 8%.As can be seen from Table 5, aircraft entering boundary B3 at 31,000 feet have much more impact than aircraft entering boundary B1 at 28,000 feet.
Concluding RemarksThe forecasting of Dynamic Density metrics for prediction intervals of two hours and longer requires both the position and the velocity of all the aircraft.As predicting even the correct sector count is hard, it is unreasonable to expect correct position and velocity information derived from schedule or flight plan information.However, it is reasonable to assume the mean number of aircraft can be predicted for a prediction interval of two hours based on historical data, but there may be one, two or three additional aircraft.Given the nature of uncertainties of positions of the aircraft, one can question if Dynamic Density metrics can be of any value.The approach outlined in this paper shows that a useful characterization of expected complexity can be made even in the presence of such uncertainties.The impact of additional aircraft on complexity is not uniform for all appearances of an additional aircraft, but depends on the location of the unexpected aircraft relative to the expected aircraft.Knowledge of what is the magnitude of worst-case impact and in what situations the impact would be worst would be useful in traffic flow management.New unexpected aircraft maybe popup aircraft that appear at interior points in a sector or aircraft that appear at boundaries of a sector.Regions of worst impact for popup aircraft were found to be the intersections of major flows in the case of ZDC32 and ZID81.Also, it was found that the impact of a new aircraft appearing at sector boundaries varies significantly depending on the boundary in the case of both sectors ZDC32 and ZID81.This analysis methodology to characterize the prediction characteristics of dynamic density can be extended to other sectors and other models of dynamic density.Depending on the sector and the complexity function, when a sector is highly congested, the method identifies aircraft entering the sector at certain locations, boundaries and altitudes, whose errors in prediction contribute significantly to the increase in workload.If these errors cannot be reduced, it may be necessary to limit the traffic approaching the sector from these altitudes and boundaries.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.a Complexity C1 Distribution
