IntroductionUrban Air Mobility (UAM) can alleviate transportation congestion on the ground by utilizing three-dimensional (3D) airspace efficiently, just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently [1].The envisioned concept of UAM involves a network of small electric aircraft that takeoff and land vertically (eVTOL) that can enable rapid and reliable transportation between suburbs and cities and, ultimately, within cities [1][2][3][4].Recently, technological advances have made it possible to build and flight test eVTOL aircraft [2,4,5].Several companies, for example, Airbus A 3 , Aurora Flight Sciences, EHang, Joby Aviation, Kitty Hawk, Leonardo, Lilium, Terrafugia, and Volocopter, are pursuing different design approaches to make eVTOLs a reality [4].Despite various designs, they all have distributed electric propulsion (DEP) systems in common [2].However, the low specific energy of current lithium-ion polymer (Li-Po) battery technology used in DEP imposes constraints on the flight endurance of such aircraft.In general, multirotor eVTOLs are a relatively low cruise speed aircraft compared to winged eVTOL aircraft; therefore, atmospheric winds play a significant role in their trajectories.The operational benefits of wind-optimal trajectories have been extensively studied for commercial aircraft [6][7][8] but not for eVTOLs in the UAM environment.Therefore, in the current research, the operational benefits of wind-optimal trajectories are studied in the UAM context.The focus of the current research is on the trajectories of a multirotor eVTOL aircraft on short UAM missions (less than 60 miles) [1,9].Therefore, an optimal control model for a multirotor eVTOL is formulated that includes a wind effect model to quantify the effect of wind on the trajectory.The optimal control problem, formulated using a lateral dynamics model and operational constraints, is numerically solved using the direct collocation method.The primary motivation of the paper is to determine if there is an operational benefit using wind-optimal trajectories for short flights (less than 60 miles) in the urban environment.Energy consumption and flight duration flying wind-optimal trajectories between origins and destinations in the Dallas-Fort Worth and New York metropolitan areas are compared with the corresponding energy consumption and flight duration flying on the great-circle paths between the same origin and destination pairs to determine the operational benefit of wind-optimal routing for short flights.In this research, the concept of operations (CONOPs) of the multirotor eVTOL aircraft is assumed to be as follows: i) vertical climb; ii) cruise at a constant altitude along a path between UAM vertiports in metropolitan areas like the Dallas-Fort Worth and New York; and iii) vertical descent.The scope of this research is focused on the low-altitude (1600 ft above mean sea level (MSL)) cruise phase [10]; therefore, vertical climb and descent phases have been ignored in the problem formulation.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: (i) In section III, the optimal control problem with energy consumption as the performance index is formulated to generate 4D trajectories for a multirotor eVTOL aircraft.The optimal control model presented includes a wind model for quantifying the effect of wind on a trajectory; (ii) In section IV, wind-optimal and great-circle trajectories are generated for the multirotor eVTOL in the Dallas-Fort Worth and New York metropolitan areas under different wind conditions using the direct method.The flight duration results for different scenarios are validated using a simulation tool designed and developed by NASA; and (iii) Finally, in section V, the main findings for this research study are summarized.
III. Optimal Control Model
A. eVTOL Aircraft ModelIn this research, a quadrotor eVTOL aircraft concept proposed by Silva et al. [11], as shown in Figure 1, is used to study the effect of wind on a multirotor eVTOL aircraft on UAM missions.The eVTOL has six-seater (up to 545 kg payload) capacity with the best range speed of 50.4 m/s (98 kts).Table 1 shows performance data of the eVTOL aircraft [11] used in this research for trajectory optimization in cruise phase.
B. Flight Dynamics and Kinematics ModelTo study the effect of wind on the cruise phase of the multirotor eVTOL aircraft, a lateral flight dynamics model (two dimensional in space and one dimensional in time) is considered.The four lateral states of the model are: λ, τ, V, ψ; where λ is the latitude, τ is the longitude, V is the true airspeed (assumed to have only horizontal component during the cruise) and ψ is the heading angle w.r.t north [12,13].The three control variables of the model are: the net thrust (T), the rotor tip path plane pitch angle (θ) and the rotor tip path plane roll (bank) angle (φ).Therefore, the quasi-steady cruise flight dynamics and kinematics of the multirotor eVTOL aircraft under wind conditions in a vehicle carried frame of reference are as follows [2,3,8,[12][13][14][15]:dV dt = T cos φ sin θ -D m - dW N dt cos ψ - dW E dt sin ψ(1)V dψ dt = T sin φ m + dW N dt sin ψ - dW E dt cos ψ(2)(R Earth + h) dλ dt = V cos ψ + W N = V GS cos χ(3)(R Earth + h) cos λ dτ dt = V sin ψ + W E = V GS sin χ (4)where D is the parasite drag, V GS is the ground speed, χ is the course, h is the altitude above mean sea level and R Earth is the mean radius of the Earth and, W N and W E are the components of the wind in north and east directions, respectively.In this research, time derivative of wind components is assumed to be zero given the short range operations are expected to be less than 60 miles [1,4].For the quadrotor eVTOL aircraft, assuming that the rotors have negligible interference with each other, the net thrust (T) produced by the four rotors is given by:T = 4 n=1 (T rotor ) n(5)where (T rotor ) n is the thrust produced by the n th rotor.Also, assuming all the rotors produce the same amount of thrust (T rotor ) in cruise phase, the net thrust (T) produced by the rotors is given by:T = 4T rotor(6)
C. Drag ModelThe parasite drag (D) on the multirotor eVTOL is calculated as follows [11]:D = 1.1984q (7)where q is the dynamic pressure (N/m 2 ).The dynamic pressure (q) is calculated as follows:q = ρV 2 2 (8)where ρ is the density of air, which is a function of altitude.
D. Momentum Theory in HoverUsing momentum theory [16][17][18], the hover induced velocity (v h ) is given by: v h = T rotor 2ρA rotor (9) where A rotor is the rotor disk area (πR 2 ) and R is the radius of the rotor.
E. Momentum Theory in Forward FlightConsider an isolated rotor in forward motion at true airspeed (V), with angle of attack (α) between the air-stream and the rotor disk (tip path plane).The solution for induced velocity (v i ) is given by [16][17][18]:v i = v 2 h (V cos α) 2 + (V sin α + v i ) 2(10)where the hover induced velocity (v h ) on the right-hand side of the equation ( 10) is computed using the equation ( 9).The equation ( 10) is a quartic polynomial that can be analytically solved for induced velocity (v i ).Out of the four roots of the quartic equation ( 10), the one with real-positive and value lower than v h is the correct solution for cruise phase.The equation (10) can also be numerically solved using an iterative technique with initial guess for v i as v h .Once v i is computed, the induced power loss of an isolated rotor (P induced rotor ) in forward flight is computed as follows [18,19]:P induced rotor = κT rotor v i(11)where the induced power factor (κ) is assumed to be 1.75 in this research [11].
F. Power Required by the eVTOL AircraftBased on the quasi-steady flight assumption in the current research, the instantaneous power required in forward cruise flight at a constant altitude is equal to the sum of the induced power, parasite power, and profile power as follows [2,3,17,18,20]:P required = P induced + P parasite + P profile (12)The induced power loss of the eVTOL aircraft (P induced ) is equal to the summation of the induced power loss of each rotor (P induced rotor ).Therefore, the induced power loss of the quadrotor eVTOL aircraft is given by [11,18]:P induced = 4 n=1 (P induced rotor ) n = κ 4 n=1 (T rotor v i ) n(13)The power required to propel the eVTOL aircraft forward (the parasite power loss) at a constant altitude is given by [18]:P parasite = TV sin α(14)The profile power loss is calculated from a mean blade drag coefficient (C d mean ) as follows [11,18,21]:P profile = ρA rotor (ΩR) 3 σC d mean F P 8 (15)where Ω is the rotational velocity of the rotor blades, σ is the thrust weighted solidity ratio, C d mean is the mean blade drag coefficient and F P is the function that accounts for the increase of the blade section velocity with rotor edgewise and axial speed [11,18,21].However, F P is assumed to be a constant (Table 1) in this research because of cruise at constant altitude and nominal cruise speed.Therefore, using the equations from ( 12) to (15), the instantaneous power required (P required ) in forward flight is given by:P required = κ 4 n=1 (T rotor v i ) n + TV sin α + ρA rotor (ΩR) 3 σC d mean F P 8(16)
G. Performance Index of Optimal Control ProblemThe performance index for the wind-optimal trajectory optimization problem is as follows:J = ∫ t f t 0 (P required )dt = ∫ t f t 0 (κ 4 n=1 (T rotor v i ) n + TV sin α + ρA rotor (ΩR) 3 σC d mean F P 8 )dt(17)where t 0 is the initial flight time at the top of climb (TOC) placed directly above the origin vertiport at the cruise altitude and t f is the final flight time to reach the top of descent (TOD) placed directly above the destination vertiport at the cruise altitude.
H. Path Constraints of Optimal Control ProblemFor a level flight (cruise) in the presence of zero vertical wind, the net vertical force on the multirotor eVTOL aircraft is zero; therefore, the following path constraint is imposed on the problem:T cos φ cos θ = mg (18)where m is the mass of the multirotor eVTOL aircraft and g is the acceleration due to the gravity.The instantaneous power required (P required in kw) is bounded by the total deliverable power (P max ) of the quadrotor eVTOL aircraft [11,19]:P required ≤ 494.25(19)where P required is defined in equation 16.
I. Great-Circle Path ConstraintThe course angle ( χ) for the great-circle trajectory between the two waypoints is calculated as follows [22]:tan χ = sin(τ 2 -τ 1 )cosλ 2 sinλ 2 cosλ 1 -sinλ 1 cosλ 2 cos(τ 2 -τ 1 )(20)where the origin latitude-longitude is (λ 1 , τ 1 ) and the destination latitude-longitude is (λ 2 , τ 2 ).However, to generate a great-circle trajectory between the two waypoints using the optimal control framework developed in this research, a path constraint as a function of the wind components (W N and W E ), latitude-longitude coordinates of the two waypoints and heading angle (ψ) is required.Therefore, the course angle ( χ) needs to be eliminated from the equation (20).Using the equations ( 3) and ( 4), the heading angle (ψ) required to fly the course angle ( χ) in the presence of the wind is computed as follows:tan χ = V sinψ + W E V cosψ + W N(21)where W N and W E are the components of the wind in north and east directions respectively.Given same left-hand side of the equations ( 20) and ( 21), therefore, the right-hand sides of the equations can be equated as follows:V sinψ+ W E V cosψ + W N = sin(τ 2 -τ 1 )cosλ 2 sinλ 2 cosλ 1 -sinλ 1 cosλ 2 cos(τ 2 -τ 1 )(22)Hence, the path constraint for the great-circle trajectory between the two waypoints is given by:(V sinψ + W E )(sinλ 2 cosλ 1 -sinλ 1 cosλ 2 cos(τ 2 -τ 1 )) -(V cosψ + W N )(sin(τ 2 -τ 1 )cosλ 2 ) = 0(23)
IV. Numerical Study and Results
A. Wind DataThe Rapid Refresh (RR) operational weather prediction system, available on an hourly basis at 13 km spatial resolution from the National Center for Environmental Prediction [23], has been used to extract the wind data for analysis.The wind data are extracted for January 2019 (i.e., 31 days) during peak traffic hours in the morning, i.e., 7 AM to 11 AM at cruise altitude (1600 ft above MSL) in 1-minute intervals at two major metropolitan areas (Dallas-Fort Worth and New York) of the United States.The extracted wind data are analyzed to find the date and local time when the wind magnitude is the highest (strongest wind) at these two metropolitan areas.
B. Optimal Control SolverThe trajectory optimization problems can be numerically solved, either using the direct or indirect method [24].Direct methods typically discretize the trajectory optimization problem, and convert the original trajectory optimization problem into a non-linear program.On the other hand, indirect methods are characterized by explicitly solving the optimality conditions stated in terms of the adjoint differential equations, the maximum principle, and associated boundary (transversality) conditions [25].Using the calculus of variations, the optimal control necessary conditions can be derived by setting the first variation of the Hamiltonian function to zero.A common way to distinguish these two methods is that a direct method discretizes and then optimizes, while an indirect method optimizes and then discretizes [24,26].In this research, PSOPT has been used to solve the optimal control problem to generate wind-optimal trajectories for the multirotor eVTOL aircraft.PSOPT is an open-source optimal control software package written in C++ that uses direct collocation methods such as pseudospectral methods [27].Pseudospectral methods directly discretize the original optimal control problem to formulate a non-linear programming problem, which is then solved numerically using a sparse non-linear programming solver to find approximate local optimal solutions.IPOPT is an open-source C++ package for large-scale non-linear optimization, which uses an interior point method [27,28].IPOPT is the default non-linear programming algorithm used by PSOPT.
C. FACETFuture Air Traffic Management (ATM) Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) is a tool designed and developed by NASA over the last 20 years to provide a flexible simulation environment for the exploration, development and evaluation of advanced ATM concepts [29].FACET models four-dimensional (4D) aircraft trajectories in the presence of winds using round-earth kinematic equations.Aircraft can be flown along flight plan routes or great-circle routes as they climb, cruise and descend per their aircraft-type performance models.Performance parameters of the aircraft are obtained from a data look-up table.Therefore, for the current research, a look-up table is created for the multirotor eVTOL aircraft based on the performance data of the conceptual multirotor eVTOL proposed by Silva, et al. [11].In this research, the flight duration results of the optimal control framework using PSOPT solver are validated using the neighboring-optimal wind routing algorithm [30] implemented in FACET for computing the wind-optimal route.FACET implementation performs a bi-linear interpolation in spatial and temporal dimensions on the available gridded wind data.
D. Case Study -Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan AreaFor the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, as stated earlier, the wind data are extracted at 1600 ft above MSL in 1-minute time intervals at grid points shown in Figure 3.The grid points are equispaced 10 km apart and cover 10 4 km 2 area.To find the date and local time when the strongest wind (highest wind speed) occurred: First, the spatial average of wind speed is computed in 1-minute intervals (epochs).Second, the spatially averaged wind speeds at each epoch are compared to find the epoch at which the highest wind speed occurred.The data analytics results showed that the strongest wind (maximum wind speed) occurred on January 19, 2019, at 8 AM Central Standard Time (CST) i.e., at epoch = 1547906400 seconds.The statistics of the wind data on January 19, 2019, at 8 AM in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area are shown in Table 2.To solve for the wind-optimal trajectories in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area using the optimal control solver PSOPT, the north and the east components of the wind are assumed to be uniform in the chosen region, given the relatively small standard deviations of wind components as shown in Table 2. Therefore, the north component of the wind (W N in m/s) and the east component of the wind (W E in m/s) are modeled as follows in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area: To study wind-optimal trajectories, three routes originating from the vertiport at KKEG (32.901767, -97.193954), are considered.Based on the longest great-circle distance between the vertiports in UAM -X2 engineering evaluation [10], the destination vertiports are chosen 30 nautical miles from the origin.The destinations (as shown in Table 3) are also chosen such that the initial bearing of the great-circle routes approximately faces crosswind, headwind, and tailwind, respectively.From Figure 4, it can be seen that in the uniform wind field, for the multirotor eVTOL aircraft on a short UAM mission (30 nm), the energy consumption and flight duration for the wind-optimal trajectories are same as the corresponding great-circle trajectories.However, because of the slow nominal cruise speed (50.41 m/s), the energy consumption and flight duration while flying in the headwind is 2-3 times higher than flying the same distance (30 nm) in the tailwind.As shown in Figure 4, the flight duration (cruise) results of PSOPT are validated using overall flight duration (climb, cruise and descent) results of FACET.The flight duration results of FACET are in general slightly higher (1 -2 mins) because of the short climb and descent phases.W N = -16.92(24)
E. Case Study -New York Metropolitan AreaSimilar to the Dallas-Fort Worth case study, wind data are sampled at the 1-minute interval at grid locations 10 km apart in the New York metropolitan area, as shown in Figure 5a.Following the earlier process, the maximum value of the wind speed occurred on January 24, 2019, at 10 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) i.e., at epoch = 1548342000 (seconds); Figure 5b shows the corresponding wind field.The statistics of the wind data are shown in Table 4.Because PSOPT requires the equations in an analytical form, the MATLAB curve-fitting toolbox [31] is used for obtaining equations for north and east components of the wind, needed in equations ( 3) and ( 4).This resulted in the following wind model: where λ (rad) is the latitude and and τ (rad) is the longitude.The R-square values of the obtained equations: ( 26) and ( 27), are 0.9764 and 0.9441 respectively.Figures 6a and6b show the fitted surfaces described by the equations ( 26) and (27).W N = 1218 -691.3λ + 539.4τ(26)W E = 380 -253.5λ + 153.9τ(27)To study wind-optimal trajectories, three routes originating from the vertiport at KEWR (40.703869, -74.176071) are considered.Based on the longest great-circle distance between the vertiports in UAM -X2 engineering evaluation [10], the destination vertiports are chosen 30 nautical miles from the vertiport at KEWR in the New York metropolitan area.The destinations (as shown in Table 5) are also chosen such that the initial bearing of the great-circle routes approximately faces crosswind, headwind, and tailwind, respectively.From Figure 7, it can be seen that in the non-uniform wind field, the energy consumption and flight duration for the wind-optimal trajectory are 1.2 % lower than the corresponding great-circle trajectory.However, because of the slow nominal cruise speed (50.41 m/s) and high magnitude of the headwind (approx.28 m/s), the energy consumption and flight duration while flying in the headwind are 4-5 times higher than flying the same distance (30 nm) in the tailwind.As shown in Figure 7, the flight duration (cruise) results of PSOPT are validated using overall flight duration (climb, cruise and descent) results of FACET.The flight duration results of FACET are in general slightly higher (1 -2 mins) because of the short climb and descent phases.To perform the sensitivity analysis on wind-optimal trajectory, the headwind route is further extended to 50 nm (57.54 miles).The headwind route is picked among the three routes because it showed the greatest operational benefit (1.2 %) for wind-optimal trajectory when compared to the corresponding great-circle trajectory.For the headwind route (origin: 41.3661, -74.176071 and destination: 40.2, -74.176071), the operational benefits with the wind-optimal trajectory when compared to the great-circle trajectory are less than 2.5 % as shown in Table 6.
F. Case Study -Simulated Wind in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan AreaTo study the impact of wind field with varying direction on wind-optimal trajectories, a wind field is simulated such that the north component of the wind (W N ) is linearly varied from + 15 m/s at the origin vertiport (32.901767, -97.193954) to -15 m/s at the destination vertiport (32.897850, -96.204208) as shown in Figure 8.The linear curve-fit of the north component of the wind (W N in m/s) obtained using the MATLAB curve-fitting tool [31] is as follows:W N = -1736.68τ-2931.03( 28)W E = 15(29)From Table 7, it can be seen that in the wind field with varying direction as shown in Figure 8, for the multirotor eVTOL aircraft on a short UAM mission (30 nm), the energy consumption and flight duration for the wind-optimal trajectory are approximately 1.4 % lower than the corresponding great-circle trajectory (Figure 9).
V. ConclusionIn this research, the optimal control problem with energy consumption as the performance index is formulated to generate trajectories for a multirotor electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft on a short urban air mobility mission (less than 60 miles).The optimal control model presented includes a wind model for quantifying the effect of wind on a trajectory.To create a wind model, for the Dallas-Fort Worth and New York metropolitan areas, the real wind data from the Rapid Refresh are used.Wind data are then analyzed to find the date and local time when the wind magnitude is the highest (strongest wind) at these two metropolitan areas.Finally, the wind models are created at these two metropolitan areas by performing a linear curve fit on the strongest wind data.Further, this paper presents a framework to compare energy consumption and flight duration flying wind-optimal trajectories and great-circle trajectories to evaluate the operational benefit of wind-optimal routing for short flights.The formulated lateral trajectory optimization problem is numerically solved using the pseudospectral method for a NASA-proposed conceptual multirotor electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.The numerical results in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area in the presence of uniform wind conditions suggest that wind-optimal trajectories are identical to the corresponding great-circle trajectories for short flights (30 nm).The numerical results in the New York metropolitan area in the presence of non-uniform wind conditions suggest that wind-optimal trajectories show slight operational benefits compared to the corresponding great-circle trajectories for short flights (30 nm) with maximum benefit (1.2 %) in the headwind condition.Upon performing a sensitivity analysis by extending the headwind route to 50 nm, the operational benefit increased to 2.4 %.The flight duration results for different scenarios are validated using a simulation tool designed and developed by NASA over the last 20 years for exploring advanced air traffic management concepts.To substantiate the wind effect results from the New York metropolitan area, a simulated wind field was created such that the crosswind component of the wind to the direct route between origin and destination changes the direction completely, whereas the tailwind component remains constant.Under such wind conditions, the trajectory optimization results show the maximum operational benefit to be 1.4 %.In conclusion, this research study suggests that for short flights in an urban environment, the wind-optimal trajectories have a very slight (insignificant) operational advantage over the great-circle trajectories in terms of energy consumption and flight duration.As expected, headwinds and tailwinds along the route of flight have a significant impact on energy consumption and flight duration.D= Parasite drag T = Net thrust T rotor = Thrust produced by an isolated rotor λ = Latitude of the eVTOL aircraft τ = Longitude of the eVTOL aircraft h = Altitude above mean sea level of the eVTOL aircraft v h = Rotor induced velocity in hover v i = Rotor induced velocity during forward flight V = True airspeed of the eVTOL aircraft V GS = Ground speed of the eVTOL aircraft m = Mass of the eVTOL aircraft q = Dynamic pressure of the eVTOL aircraft ρ = Density of air W N = North component of wind velocity W E = East component of wind velocity α = Angle of attack of air-stream relative to rotor tip path plane ψ = Heading angle of the eVTOL aircraft χ = Course angle of the eVTOL aircraft θ = Rotor tip-path-plane pitch angle φ = Rotor tip-path-plane roll angle κ = Induced power factor P max = Total deliverable power A rotor = Rotor disk area R = Radius of the rotor R Earth = Radius of the Earth assuming spherical model Ω = Rotational velocity of the rotor blades σ = Thrust weighted solidity ratio C d mean = Mean blade drag coefficient
