Reference data for all of these documents appears in the bibliography (Appendix B).The source material used to describe NextGen comprises the JPDO documents listed in Appendix B.The paragraphs immediately below briefly summarize the applicable NextGen and ATM-Airspace Project documents.More detailed descriptions of both sets of documents are presented in Appendix A and in Section 2, respectively.The versions used for this study were those in effect when the analyses were performed in early 2008; the publishing date of each document is shown in Appendix B.Integrated Weather, which integrates real-time weather data into decisionmaking tools.The ConOps identifies research and policy issues that must be resolved to implement these and other new concepts.
R&D PlanA further level of detail appears in the R&D Plan, organized into 12 R&D needs areas which address the research issues introduced in the ConOps.This plan was developed to serve as guidance for the JPDO partner agencies and other stakeholders.It defines high-level R&D milestones regarding policies, procedures, and technologies to achieve the capabilities in the ConOps.For each of the R&D needs areas, key NextGen challenges are described as a set of objectives, outcomes, and R&D needs.Each R&D need consists of a statement of what is needed, when it is needed, and which agencies will participate in its accomplishment.Most R&D needs encompass a broad range of activities; hence, many specific research initiatives may be required to support a particular R&D need.These R&D needs, as the final product of the flowdown, provide the information to guide NASA research and ascertain its relevance.
Integrated Work PlanThe final JPDO document is the Integrated Work Plan (IWP).It describes the long-term transition from the current air transportation system to the fully realized NextGen enterprise.It lays out NextGen research, policy, and implementation activities and their dependencies, and provides a collaborative planning and management tool for all of the mission partners.The IWP contains the full spectrum of work required by NextGen, and the R&D activities in the IWP correspond to the R&D needs in the R&D Plan.The IWP also shows the relationships among the R&D elements and other implementation activities.As the governing document, the IWP will be updated periodically.It is organized into the major functional areas of the NextGen enterprise, which were derived from the ConOps and the NextGen enterprise architecture.For each of these functional areas, the IWP describes a number of data elements, such as operational improvements, policy needs, and decision points, including the 167 R&D activities taken from the R&D needs in the R&D Plan.
ATM-Airspace ProjectThe NASA Airspace Systems Program (ASP) performs research on air traffic management (ATM) concepts, capabilities, and technologies for high-capacity, efficient, and safe airspace systems.This report addresses the ATM-Airspace Project, one of the two projects which constitute the program.The ATM-Airspace Project includes research at all levels, from basic research in conjunction with NASA's university partners to integrated solutions with NextGen partners working at the systems level to explore and develop integrated research solutions that define and assess ground and air automation concepts and technologies necessary for NextGen.Commensurate with the lead times involved for the evolution of research to implementation, most of the research focuses on issues related to concepts planned for implementation from 2019 onward.ATM-Airspace Project research activities are organized into groupings of like technical activities called research focus areas (RFAs).Four of these are related to specific air traffic management functions:Separation Assurance, which reduces capacity limitations arising from human-controlled separation assurance for transition and cruise airspace Airspace Super Density Operations, which reduces capacity limitations arising from human-controlled separation assurance for terminal airspace Dynamic Airspace Configuration, which strives to increase capacity through dynamic allocation of airspace structure and controller resources Traffic Flow Management, which allocates demand through control of departure times, route modification, adaptive speed control in the presence of uncertainty, and other techniques.Supporting the functional thrusts of these RFAs are three supporting RFAs which cut across the functional RFAs:Trajectory Prediction, Synthesis, and Uncertainty, which develops trajectory predictions that are interoperable with aircraft flight management system (FMS) trajectory generations that use predictions of propagation and growth of uncertainty Performance Based Services, which explores the performance-enhancing effect of emerging airborne technologies on solutions to fundamental ATM problems System-Level Design Analysis and Simulation Tools, which develops system design and analysis tools to assess the functional and temporal distribution of work between automation and humans.The project descriptions present specific milestones to be accomplished within each RFA, including a projected completion year, results to be accomplished, and metrics to measure them.
Alignment with NextGenThis report focuses on the alignment of the seven RFAs in the ATM-Airspace Project and their corresponding research milestones with the R&D needs from the NextGen R&D Plan (called R&D activities in the IWP).Alignment between the NASA program and NextGen in a broad sense is the subject of a White Paper on the NASA Aeronautics Web site titled "NASA & the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)."The paper discusses NASA's role in NextGen, how the NASA Aeronautics Research programs support NextGen R&D needs, and actions to enhance and maintain this alignment.It may be found at: http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/nextgen_whitepaper_06_26_07.pdf.Section 2 of this report describes in more detail the relationship between the ATM-Airspace Project activities and the R&D needs set forth in the NextGen R&D Plan and IWP.Because the RFAs represent logical groupings of research topics, while the IWP is organized according to functions to be performed in the operational system, the relationships between RFAs and the functional areas established in the IWP are broad and many-to-many rather than one-to-one.To definitively establish the alignment requires more detailed analysis.By examining the NASA work at the level of RFA milestones and comparing them to the NextGen R&D needs and the operational improvements supported by each R&D need, it is possible to better understand the relationship between the ATM-Airspace Project and NextGen.Analyzed at this level, it is seen that they are strongly aligned.To define this alignment, Crown Consulting subject matter experts extracted the linkages between OIs and R&D needs from the IWP and then collaborated with members of the Airspace Systems Program and ATM-Airspace Project staffs to develop the linkages between project milestones in the ATM-Airspace Project Reference Material and NextGen R&D needs.Section 2 of this report further explains the methodology and describes the alignment for each RFA.
ATM-AIRSPACE PROJECT ALIGNMENT WITH NEXTGEN R&D NEEDS
IntroductionThe NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is guided by three core principles: (1) mastery and intellectual stewardship of the core competencies of aeronautics for the Nation in all flight regimes, (2) focusing research on topics that are appropriate to NASA's unique capabilities, and (3) addressing the fundamental R&D needs of NextGen while working closely with its agency partners in the JPDO.In accordance with these principles, ARMD has established a balanced research portfolio that draws on its NASA-unique capabilities to address air traffic management, environmental, efficiency, and safety-related research challenges, all of which must be resolved to achieve the NextGen vision.ARMD research activities comprise three major programs: the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, the Airspace Systems Program, and the Aviation Safety Program; all three contribute directly to NextGen.Together, these programs address critical air traffic management, environmental, efficiency, and safety-related research challenges.The output of this focused commitment and investment includes advanced concepts, algorithms, tools, methods, technologies, and validation activities, all of which are critical to the success of NextGen.The Airspace Systems Program addresses the R&D needs of NextGen by developing en route, transitional, terminal, and surface capabilities.It consists of two separate projects, ATM-Airspace and ATM-Airportal, which together conduct the long-term research needed to implement the NextGen vision.The ATM-Airspace Project develops and explores fundamental concepts and integrated solutions that address the optimal allocation of ground and air automation technologies necessary for NextGen.This project focuses NASA's technical expertise and facilities to address the question of where, when, how, and to what extent automation can be applied to moving aircraft safely and efficiently through the National Airspace System (NAS).The ATM-Airportal Project develops and validates algorithms, concepts, and technologies to increase throughput of the runway complex and achieve high efficiency in the use of airportal resources such as gates, taxiways, runways, and final approach airspace.NASA research in this project will lead to solutions that safely integrate surface and terminal area air traffic optimization tools and systems with 4D trajectory operations.Ultimately, the roles and responsibilities of humans and automation in the ATM system will be addressed by both projects.This document addresses the ATM-Airspace Project, with a focus on its alignment with the needs of NextGen.
ATM-Airspace Project SummaryThe goal of the ATM-Airspace Project is to develop and explore concepts, capabilities, and integrated solutions that contribute fundamental research data and analyses needed for NextGen.Through analyses, prototyping, laboratory-based simulations, and, in special cases, flight evaluations, NASA together with the JPDO, industry, and academic partners will develop and promulgate knowledge to reduce the technical risk of NextGen. Figure 2.2-1 depicts the decomposition levels of the ATM-Airspace Project, as portrayed in the on-line ATM-Airspace Project Reference Material.The project includes research at all levels of complexity, with NASA-sponsored academic and industrial research partners concentrating on foundational physics and modeling (Level 1 in Figure 2.2-1) and discipline-level capabilities (Level 2), and with NASA its JPDO partners addressing multidiscipline capabilities (Level 3) and interdisciplinary system design tasks (Level 4).The levels are a decomposition of the problem space which maps to the integrated solutions needed for NextGen at the top and the sciences, disciplines, and multidisciplinary research at the lower levels.in super-dense and regional or metroplex airspace while minimizing environmental impact System Level Design, Analysis and Simulation Tools (SLDAST): Develops and applies system design and analysis methods and simulation tools to produce and assess integrated, comprehensive design alternatives.Each RFA has a unique focus, but because much of the research is interrelated, many RFAs depend on concurrent research in the other areas.Additionally, research and development activities in the ATM-Airspace Project are tightly coupled with the work in the ATM-Airportal Project.While they each respond to unique constraints, the research efforts intended to address Airspace and Airportal issues often depend on one another.
Alignment of the ATM-Airspace Project with NextGen R&D NeedsSection 2.4 of this report summarizes the primary research activities of each RFA and describes how each RFA supports specific R&D needs for NextGen.The section for each RFA includes the following elements: Title and description -Identifies the RFA and provides a summary of its technical concentration.A major component of the ATM-Airspace Project acquisition strategy is the use of Research Opportunities in Aeronautics NASA Research Announcements (NRAs).The funding mechanisms used by NASA for research selected through an NRA are interagency transfers, grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and NASA's internal processes for funding activities at its centers.A brief description of applicable NRAs is included in the section that addresses each RFA.Discussion of the supported R&D needs -This element introduces the primary NextGen R&D needs supported by the RFA.A table in each section presents the specific R&D needs in the NextGen R&D Plan that require the research of each RFA.It includes a description of the need, required completion date, and supported NextGen operational improvements described in the IWP.The NextGen R&D Plan specifies each of the R&D needs by alphanumeric reference.An "R" followed by a sequentially assigned number indicates an identified research need; "D" followed by a sequential number indicates an identified development requirement.Alignment of NASA milestones to R&D needs -The third element of each section shows the alignment between ATM-Airspace Project milestones for each RFA and specific NextGen R&D needs addressed by each milestone.This is presented at the milestone level because that provides the best description of what NASA is doing to support each R&D need.Analysis of the alignment at the milestone-to-R&D-need level illustrates complete alignment of the project with NextGen requirements.Milestones and R&D requirements are unlikely to remain completely static throughout the life of the program; some may change as a better understanding of the desired capability emerges from fundamental research informing more mature concepts.The ATM-Airspace Project expects to continually refine its project activities and milestones to maximize their responsiveness to NextGen needs.To aid in understanding the subsequent discussion, it is necessary to introduce the NASA milestone numbering scheme.The numbering scheme includes the project name (AS, in this case), the level of the milestone in terms of NASA's four-level model, the RFA for that milestone, and a sequential number identifying each milestone.Table 2.3-I presents the numbering scheme for ATM-Airspace Project milestones.For example, milestone AS.1.2.03 is the third Level 1 milestone in the PBS research focus area of the ATM-Airspace Project.The analysis of the alignment between the ATM-Airspace Project and NextGen is based on matching elements of the project structure to elements of NextGen.While the ATM-Airspace Project is organized into RFAs, the NextGen IWP is organized into functional areas and subsidiary functional areas, designated as subareas in this report.Table 2.3-II lists the nine functional areas and the three subareas of the Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support functional area.The alignment between the NextGen and ATM-Airspace Project constructs is summarized in two tables which recur for each RFA.The first set of tables, titled "NextGen R&D Needs Addressed by (RFA name)," lists the R&D needs associated with each RFA and the operational improvements (OIs) supported by each of the R&D needs.The second set of tables lists the milestones for each RFA and the R&D needs supported by each of those milestones.The milestone set used for this analysis is taken from the ATM-Airspace Project Reference Material.Figure 2.3-1 illustrates the information flow that leads to this analysis.Because the R&D needs represent the expression of technology needed to support NextGen, and because the project milestones are the most specific expression of technology accomplishments within the ATM-Airspace Project, the linkage between NextGen and the ATM-Airspace Project is most appropriately described at the level of R&D needs and project milestones.
Figure 2.3-1 Constructs for NextGen and ATM-Airspace Project AlignmentThe tables were developed in several steps.The first step was to associate the R&D needs in the NextGen R&D Plan with the appropriate RFAs of the ATM-Airspace Project.This step, conducted in collaboration with members of the Airspace Systems Program and ATM-Airspace Project staff, considered the activities and research topics of the RFAs and compared these with the R&D needs to determine which R&D need should be associated with each RFA.As stated in Section 1.3, because of the nature of the RFAs and the R&D needs, an R&D need may be associated with several RFAs, and vice versa.The second step, accomplished by Crown Consulting subject matter experts, was to extract from the IWP the NextGen functional area(s) and operational improvements directly supported by each R&D need (identified in the tables as "Supported First-Tier OIs").This resulted in the first set of tables.In the third step, the project milestones were analyzed with respect to their stated objectives, timeframes, and outcomes and were compared to the specific requirements of each of the R&D needs.As a result of this analysis, each milestone was associated with the R&D needs that it supports.This activity, performed independently of the first two steps, was accomplished by program and project staff members, assisted by Crown Consulting subject matter experts, on the basis of practitioner knowledge, NASA program planning data, ongoing research activities, and NextGen objectives and technology needs.The results were then categorized by RFA to generate the second set of tables.Because the two sets of tables were derived independently, the initial association of RFAs with R&D needs was not completely identical in both sets.Crown used the approach described in the preceding paragraph to reconcile the small number of differences that was found between the two sets.To ensure compatibility with the IWP, all the R&D needs listed in the tables were compared to those assigned to NASA in the IWP.It was found that the RFAs and their milestones address all R&D needs within the scope of the ATM-Airspace Project.
Alignment Analysis by Research Focus AreaThis section describes each of the RFAs of the ATM-Airspace Project and the alignment between their activities and R&D needs set forth in the NextGen IWP.
Trajectory, Prediction, Synthesis and Uncertainty (TPSU)
TPSU DescriptionTPSU identifies and defines the requirements for common capabilities and interoperability for trajectory prediction (TP).This includes the requirement to: (1) develop new TP algorithms that meet the defined requirements; (2) validate trajectory prediction accuracy; (3) identify, quantify, and model sources of uncertainty in TP; and (4) improve aircraft performance modeling.The two principal thrusts of TPSU research to satisfy these requirements are (a) fundamental trajectory modeling and estimating, and (b) accommodating trajectory prediction uncertainty.TPSU trajectory modeling and prediction research will provide common trajectory prediction algorithms and components as well as trajectory modeling and synthesis technologies needed to support cutting-edge research concepts.Multiple sources drive uncertainty related to trajectory prediction.An automation system must have detailed knowledge of the aircraft's performance characteristics, procedures, and pilot intent to accurately predict a trajectory.The modeling of inaccuracies must consider many factors, including environmental factors (e.g., wind, convective weather systems), procedural assumptions (e.g., crew-dependent procedures for top-of-descent maneuvers or approaching the runway), and variations in navigation and surveillance accuracy; all of these generate trajectory prediction uncertainty.TPSU research will focus on accurately estimating the prediction uncertainty and devising mechanisms by which this uncertainty can be accommodated in decisionmaking, particularly as applied to conflict management, as well as methods to dynamically predict uncertainty for use by stochastically based automation in mitigating its impact.Beyond basic trajectory modeling research, TPSU strives to develop commonality between different modeling tools, with an emphasis on interoperability between aircraft-based flight management system (FMS) and the numerous ground systems.TPSU envisions a common language for the fast but explicit communication of trajectories among various entities.
TPSU Supported R&D NeedsThere are three NextGen functional areas that call for the research in improved trajectory analysis carried out in TPSU: Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support, Weather Information Services, and Environmental Management Framework.The first of these encompasses three subareas, two of which, Air Navigation Operations and Air Navigation Support (ANS), are supported by TPSU.Each of the applicable functional areas and subareas is described below, along with the corresponding R&D needs identified in JPDO documentation.The Air Navigation Operations subarea describes the air-and landside improvements that enable passenger and cargo flight operations to be conducted within the limits of safety, efficiency, available resources, and local environmental issues.Within this subarea, R&D need D-0520 calls for the development of methodologies to predict trajectories, including those for new classes of vehicles, as shown in Table 2.4.1-I.R-0380 calls for research on aircraft-derived position and intent to support data exchange in high-density terminal areas.R-0820 calls for research on 4D trajectory intent data for separation procedures, R-1620 calls for traffic spacing alternatives to support operations in congested en route airspace, R-1630 calls for technologies and procedures for flow corridors to support alternatives selection on the use of flow corridors and the associated air and ground technologies, and D-0830 entails development of protocols to negotiate trajectories for supporting an implementation decision on the aircraft and ground information architectures.The Air Navigation Support subarea addresses the operational improvements necessary to establish criteria for designing and managing structured airspace in order to safely and efficiently support the flow of traffic.TPSU encompasses six R&D needs related to ANS.These include investigations on the use of 4D trajectories in clearances and flight plans to support alternatives selection decisions (R-0140), research on adaptable airspace structures to support the selection of performance-based adaptable airspace structures (R-0540), research for translating probabilistic weather information into safety and efficiency impacts (R-0570), and research on the benefits of dynamic allocation of resources (R-0680, R-0770).Additionally, R-0650 calls for research exploiting performance-based trajectories for efficient utilization of high-density terminal airspace.The Weather Information Services functional area provides a common weather picture through the development of a single authoritative source of weather data.This is accomplished through the timely and integrated collection of current weather information, the development of detailed forecasts, and the dissemination of weather information in common and consolidated formats.R-0580 calls for the development of the first generation of probabilistic weather forecasts (e.g., convective and winter storms, icing, turbulence, ceiling, and visibility) to support interagency implementation decisions.The Environmental Management Framework functional area seeks to balance the competing goals that will allow sustained aviation growth while reducing noise and aircraft engine emissions in absolute terms, as well as to improve management of environmental issues, including water quality, energy intensity, and global climate change.R&D need D-1730 calls for the development of aircraft control technologies and procedures that reduce noise and greenhouse gas emissions while improving local air quality, and R-1340 calls for protocols to negotiate trajectories to support an implementation decision on the aircraft and ground information architectures.
Performance-Based Services (PBS)
PBS DescriptionPBS develops classification systems and assesses performance capabilities needed to enable a shift toward air traffic services and operations requirements based on system performance capabilities rather than on equipment type.A major goal of PBS research is to understand and define this performance framework, its associated levels of performance, and the commensurate levels of service, all critical steps toward the NextGen vision.PBS combines the fundamental building blocks of Required Navigation Performance (RNP), Required Communication Performance (RCP) and Required Surveillance Performance (RSP) into the aggregate multidimensional parameter of Required Total System Performance (RTSP).The application-specific functions of PBS that can be enabled individually or concurrently include time-of-arrival conformance, airborne spacing, and airborne separation.PBS research embodies two major topics: (1)
PBS Supported R&D NeedsPBS is closely linked to the NextGen key capability of Performance Based Operations (PBO).The primary goal of PBO is to provide different levels of service to users of the aviation system based on the functional capabilities of their aircraft and of ground-based systems by matching Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) service levels to user performance capabilities.Defining multiple service levels addresses a wide range of user needs while encouraging more private sector innovation and free market decisionmaking.This allows users to select the performance level appropriate to their particular operation and reduces the need to dictate specific equipment requirements.This effort will also provide a tool for controlling access to highly constrained resources and/or complex operating environments.Understanding and defining this performance framework, its associated levels of performance, and the commensurate levels of service, are critical steps toward reaching the NextGen vision.Three NextGen functional areas or subareas are supported by this RFA: Air Navigation Operations, Flight Operations and Support, and Safety Management.PBS addresses five R&D needs related to the Air Navigation Operations subarea.PBS research will support the development of options, standards, and decision-support aids to enable variable separation standards based on performance levels (R-0500, see Table 2.4.2-I),define 4D trajectory intent data outputs and their precision requirements to support TBO in performancebased airspace (D-0820), and develop aircraft-based CNS performance-level requirements for self-separation (D1600).It will also support research on options for automated separation management to guide development of technology and procedures in performance-based airspace (R-0530) and on the development of three-dimensional RNAV/RNP procedures (R-0340).The Flight Operations and Support subarea describes the improvements needed for aircraft and aircraft-related systems in NextGen.This RFA supports that subarea with research on priorities for aircraft capabilities to support alternative selection and policy for standards development and certification (R-0040).The Safety Management functional area addresses safety initiatives that enhance the safety of aviation systems or improve safety processes.Its R&D needs that are supported by PBS include development of human and system performance models that capture human variability and error in highly automated systems (D-1690) and research on systems interfaces, performance models, procedures, and training to complement the development of automation procedures (D-1710).
Alignment of PBS Milestones with R&D NeedsThe text which follows summarizes the alignment of PBS milestones with NextGen R&D needs in the functional areas discussed above.The Air Navigation Operations and Air Navigation Support subareas include several R&D needs related to the development of options, standards, and decision-support aids to enable variable separation standards.Milestones that address these needs include:Identify techniques for modeling RTSP characteristics and provide extensions of such techniques.Conduct parametric RTSP batch studies of AAC and 4D-ASAS concepts under nominal and failure mode conditions.Complete human-in-the-loop studies of AAC and 4D-ASAS using minimum RTSP levels determined by previously performed batch studies.Produce a list of performance attributes corresponding to the list of candidate operational concepts and grouping the attributes under RNP, RCP, RSP, or an advanced performance measure.For the Flight Operations and Support subarea, PBS efforts to synthesize human factors and operational literature address the need to identify alternatives selection and policy for standards development and certification.Specific PBS milestones address R&D needs of the Safety Management functional area related to risk-reducing systems interfaces, performance models, procedures, and training to reduce human error.These R&D needs include:Synthesizing literature on human factors and operations, which supports multiple needs across functional areas.Producing a comprehensive list of performance attributes corresponding to the list of candidate NextGen operational concepts.
Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC)
DAC DescriptionDAC increases capacity through strategic airspace organization and dynamic allocation of airspace structures and controller resources.Research topics include the requirement to (1) develop overall classifications of airspace, (2) identify new classes of airspace for NextGen operations, (3) develop algorithms and technologies for dynamically changing airspace to make it adaptable to accommodate demand, and (4) develop generic airspace characteristics to increase interchangeability of facilities and controllers.The DAC function consists of two major components: (a) the overall organization of airspace, and (b) the ability to change the airspace structure (e.g., sectorization scheme).The organizational elements of a dynamic airspace may include, but are not limited to, tubes or highdensity corridors in the sky, 4D trajectory airspace and traditional airspace, and new classes of airspace based on advanced concepts such as automated separation.The time horizon within which traffic managers could be expected to reconfigure airspace can range from months to days to hours.Research activities for the organizational component include identifying the characteristics of the current airspace system that may limit airspace efficiency.This effort will identify a route structure that may be necessary to support NextGen operations under nominal and off-nominal conditions.The airspace classes and airspace configuration concepts that serve as building blocks will also be identified.Algorithms will be developed to identify these airspace classes based on traffic demand, weather, and the required route structure.The benefits of these new airspace classes will be identified under varying traffic load and weather conditions, as will the benefits to NextGen.Airspace structural changes are implemented based on predicted traffic demand, aircraft equipage, and weather conditions to allow adjustment of the airspace capacity based on the traffic demand, forecasted weather, and expected equipage.Activities for this component include the identification of the characteristics of current airspace design and practices that limit routine changes in the airspace to better balance demand and capacity.Algorithms will be developed to create a set of airspace configuration schemes based on traffic, weather, equipage, and routes.Two NRA subtopics support DAC:Overall Airspace Organization and Dynamic Airspace Allocation Schemes -Develops advanced concepts and algorithms for future airspace classes and develops advanced concepts and algorithms for routinely changing airspace configuration to balance capacity and demand based on the expected traffic density, aircraft equipage, and weather forecast.Characteristics of Generic Airspace and Design of Airspace Referencing Scheme -Develops characteristics of generic airspace and airspace referencing schemes to support the generic airspace, an airspace structure that could be implemented repeatedly in multiple locations regardless of geographical considerations.
DAC Supported R&D NeedsThe NextGen goal for DAC is to better serve users' needs by tailoring the availability and capacity of the airspace.This is done by creating a dynamic configuration function that gives the service provider a new degree of freedom to accommodate the airspace requests of users.DAC addresses one R&D need related to the Air Navigation Operations subarea and eight R&D needs related to the Air Navigation Support subarea.For Air Navigation Operations, DAC addresses the R&D need for applied research on technologies and procedures for flow corridors and the associated air and ground technologies (R-1630).Capacity Management (CM) is one element of Air Navigation Support.Capacity Management is the design and configuration of airspace and the allocation of other air traffic management resources.It is the preferred means of responding to dynamic forecast demand, whereby resources and performance-based services are matched with the expected demand.Capacity management needs addressed by DAC include research on methodologies for the dynamic allocation of NAS and ANSP resources (R-0680), research on airspace structure elements to reduce controller training time (R-0280), development of limited dynamic reconfiguration of arrival and departure airspace air traffic management personnel assignments and facilities to match traffic flows (D-1090), and development of technologies and procedures for dynamically adjustable advanced airspace structures for execution and for dissemination of information (D-1210).A second element of Air Navigation Support is Flow Contingency Management (FCM).FCM needs addressed by DAC include research on the ability to detect the need for and to implement changes to the airspace structure (e.g., sectorization scheme) based on predicted traffic demand, aircraft equipage, and weather conditions to allow adjustment of the airspace capacity, where needed, based on traffic demand, forecasted weather, and expected equipage (R-0540, R-0650, R-0770, R-1130).

Traffic Flow Management (TFM)
TFM DescriptionTFM identifies and resolves imbalances in the demand and supply of NAS resources, such as airspace and runways.This activity addresses the requirements to (1) assimilate weather into TFM by exploring the impact of weather (convective and nonconvective) on the capacity of NAS resources, (2) explore the roles and responsibilities of airspace users on TFM decisionmaking, (3) develop and explore the utility of both aggregate (i.e., flow-based) and aircraft-level flow control models, and ( 4) develop heuristic and optimization approaches for developing optimal flow control strategies (e.g., rerouting, departure control, airborne flight delays).The overall technical approach of the TFM research focus area is a natural progression from concept development to building core capabilities (namely, weather impact and collaborative decisionmaking) to testing and evaluation.It is organized into four initiatives: Advanced TFM Concepts focuses on the development of advanced TFM techniques that contribute to the goal of tripling NAS capacity by leveraging key features of NextGen, such as 4D trajectory-based operations, performance-based operations, automated separation assurance, and super-density operations.A key research challenge is to develop techniques for an Evaluator that utilize both individual and aggregated 4D trajectories to organize, schedule, and regulate traffic flow in accordance with calculated NAS capacity constraints.The output of this effort is an integrated set of advanced TFM concepts and the associated algorithms and models that will be essential to the development of the Evaluator.Another aspect of this work is the definition of relationships and operational transitions among the TFM, Dynamic Airspace Configuration, and Separation Assurance RFAs.This activity includes development of advanced techniques to assess the impact of TFM initiatives under both deterministic and stochastic scenarios.Candidate initiatives to be examined include rerouting and departure control at the national level; merging, spacing, and sequencing at the local level; and sequencing and scheduling in multi-airport terminal areas.The benefits and utility of these TFM control strategies will also be assessed as part of this activity.The output of this effort will be a baseline Evaluator concept of operations that describes the composition and architecture of TFM functions as well as their temporal and geographic scope.Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) in TFM focuses on the development of a methodology to incorporate user preferences into traffic flow management.This activity involves determining appropriate roles and procedures that enable users and the air traffic service providers to collaboratively design efficient and equitable traffic management processes.Advanced tools and protocols will be developed for formulating, evaluating, and implementing these collaboratively designed schemes.The output of this activity will be algorithms, procedures, and protocols for fully integrating CDM into the TFM process.Weather Impact activities in TFM will develop probabilistic models to forecast demand and capacity of NAS resources.The technical challenge is to develop modeling techniques that are robust to uncertainties such as weather conditions and substantial variations in user demand profiles.These stochastic forecasts are necessary for designing TFM control strategies (e.g., rerouting, departure delay, sequencing, and scheduling) that will balance the forecasted supply and demand profiles in an equitable and optimal manner.The outputs of this activity are probabilistic models and algorithms, as well as requirements for weather products, to enable improved predictions of supply and demand on NAS resources under uncertainty.Simulation and Evaluation of TFM Concepts will develop prototype tools to implement advanced TFM concepts employing 4D trajectories.This activity focuses on the implementation of various algorithms (e.g., probabilistic predictions of NAS resource demand and supply, regional metering and/or spacing, ground delay, and customized rerouting incorporating user preferences) in a NAS simulation environment such as the Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET).The output of this effort is a suite of advanced TFM tools integrated into a simulation test bed.

Alignment of SA Milestones with R&D NeedsThe three SA initiatives (Automated Separation Assurance Technology, Human/Automation Operating Concepts, and System Safety and Failure Recovery Analysis) conduct the research needed to accomplish the goals set for NextGen.The overall goal is to identify trajectory-based technologies and human-machine operating concepts that could support a substantial increase in capacity with safety under nominal and failure recovery operations, with airspace-user preference and with favorable cost/benefit ratios.The Air Navigation Operations subarea identifies several R&D needs; a sample of SA milestones that address this subarea includes:Identifying methods for establishing separation criteria for NextGen operations.Initial operating concept options for a service-provider-based separation assurance approach.Trajectory analysis technology for automated separation assurance, including serviceprovider-based time-based-metering.Field evaluation of trajectory analysis technology with aircraft CNS technology for automated separation assurance.The Air Navigation Support subarea identifies several needs related to the design and configuration of airspace and the allocation of other air traffic management resources.Milestones in SA that address these needs include:Strategic technology for automated resolution and trajectory change.Investigation of traffic complexity prediction for automated separation assurance.Human workload, performance, and situational awareness analysis for service-providerbased separation assurance.Analysis of failure and recovery modes associated with a service-provider-based approach to separation assurance.Analysis of aircraft CNS performance as it relates to separation assurance technology.Milestones in this RFA that address Weather Information Services R&D needs include: Technology for weather-related tactical advisories.Technology for tactical weather and traffic complexity avoidance with time-based metering constraints.Safety Management R&D needs are addressed, in part, by the following SA research activities:Methods for quantifying safety level of human operators in ATM system.Analysis of human workload, performance, and situation awareness in higher levels of automation for service-provider-based separation assurance.Analysis of failure and recovery modes associated with a service-provider-based approach to separation assurance.The following SA activities address the Environmental Management Framework functional area:Flight test evaluation of an airborne situation-awareness-based application Field evaluation of trajectory analysis technology with aircraft CNS technology for timebased metering.
Airspace Super Density Operations (ASDO)
ASDO DescriptionASDO addresses airspace capacity barriers resulting from human workload and responsibilities to enable high-efficiency trajectory-based operations that are robust to weather and other disturbances in super-dense and regional or metroplex airspace, all while minimizing environmental impact.This includes the requirements for the development of (1) simultaneous sequencing and deconfliction technologies necessary for trajectory management of aircraft in terminal and extended terminal airspace, (2) precision spacing and merging capabilities to reduce workload and spacing variance between aircraft in terminal and extended terminal airspace, and (3) methods for optimizing ASDO resource utilization among interconnected air portals.The four primary tasks of this effort are discussed below.The first major task for ASDO research is the development of an expanded Concept of Operations, leveraging the NextGen ConOps and expanding it as required to support ASDO research and concept development.This effort begins with a literature survey to determine the state of the art in proposed methods for managing terminal airspace, to identify the application of weather data to improving the efficiency of the air traffic system, and to expand on current understanding of R&D to enable ASDO.Concepts for mitigating the impact of weather focus on improvements to scheduling of terminal area NAS resources and rationing of flexible resources within the ASDO concept.Rapid prototyping and fast-time simulation will be employed to assess and iteratively refine the concept of operations based on improved understanding of the fundamental issues and development of enabling technologies to address those challenges.In coordination with the ATM-Airportal Project and the JPDO, this effort will determine the initial allocation of roles and responsibilities for the aircraft operator and the ANSP, and for the human and automation in terminal airspace operations.It will also provide guidance to the JPDO on the designation of ASDO airspace and required capabilities.The second major task is the development of sequencing and deconfliction technologies.This work advances sequencing and deconfliction methods beyond the current practices of modified first-come first-served scheduling and tactical separation service.Foundational research will lead to an understanding of the inherent uncertainty associated with execution of precision trajectories in ASDO airspace, as well as improvements in multi-objective constraint optimization for air traffic systems.Further development of these technologies through fast-time simulation will determine the control authority necessary to achieve the prescribed capacity goal and to potentially enable resource utilization schemes that enhance robustness to varied and chaotic weather.Concepts will also be developed for reducing the impact of weather forecast uncertainty on dense terminal operations.The third major ASDO research task is the development of technologies for precision spacing and merging.This research addresses the need to reduce the level of uncertainty inherent to aircraft operations in ASDO airspace and to enable many aspects of the Equivalent Visual Operations capabilities of NextGen.Fundamental challenges to execution of precise trajectories in dense terminal airspace include extending traditional concepts and theories for precision guidance and energy management to dependent, multiple aircraft scenarios, addressing as well the human factors considerations for procedures and interfaces in nominal, off-nominal, and failure modes.These will be addressed via rapid prototype analyses of proposed tools and interfaces and part-task, as well as full mission, simulation.The fourth area of ASDO research will focus on optimization of regional ASDO resources.ASDO will work closely with the ATM-Airportal Project to define methods for regional resource optimization that enhance regional ASDO capacity and robustness of that capacity to a variety of disturbances.This research will incorporate PBS concepts for defining terminal area airspace designations and their associated capability requirements.Foundational research includes developing methods for managing precision and nonprecision operations in the same airspace, as well as development of the concepts through detailed analyses and development of agent-based models for inclusion in system-level assessments of the ASDO concept with NAS simulation capabilities.Five NRA subtopics support

introduction of mid-term NextGen concepts and capabilities will have on operations in normal conditions, and it will investigate alternative concepts for robustly coping with routine, non-normal

SummaryTable 2.5-I, below, summarizes the preceding tables showing the number of milestones within each RFA of the ATM-Airspace Project and the number of R&D needs and associated OIs directly supported by each RFA.As noted in the table, the number of R&D needs and OIs supported is not additive, since each RFA addresses a number of R&D needs and associated OIs that are also addressed by other RFAs.As shown, the 118 milestones of the ATM-Airspace Project support 54 R&D needs.In accordance with its responsibilities, the ATM-Airspace Project emphasizes research, and thus 48 of the supported R&D needs are research needs (R-identifiers), the remaining 16 being development needs (D-identifiers).A total of 48 OIs are directly associated with these R&D needs supported by the project.As expected, the project activities focus largely on the Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support functional area of the IWP.As shown in Table 2.5-II, the ATM-Airspace Project directly supports 45 R&D needs in that functional area and 42 associated OIs, as well additional R&D needs and OIs in the Weather Information Services, Safety Management, and Environmental Management Framework functional areas.Table 2.5-III shows how the supported R&D needs are distributed among the RFAs.As can be expected from their broad and crosscutting nature, the ASDO and SLDAST RFAs each support a relatively large number of R&D needs.It is also worth noting, as indicated by the entries in the table, that the RFAs provide broad support for weather, safety, and environmental challenges associated with NextGen.
CONCLUSIONSThis report presents an analysis of the alignment between the NASA ATM-Airspace Project and the R&D needs of NextGen expressed in the NextGen R&D Plan and the NextGen Integrated Work Plan (IWP).With NASA committed to focusing its research activities on NextGen, these R&D needs represent the requirements which the NASA ATM-Airspace Project must satisfy.The information in the body of this report shows how closely the project meets these requirements.For a meaningful comparison between project activities and NextGen needs, it was necessary to perform the analysis at the level of project milestones in the NASA hierarchy and at the level of R&D needs for NextGen, since elements at higher levels are too general and too broadly encompassing.NASA program and project personnel, assisted by Crown Consulting subject matter experts, analyzed the R&D needs in the NextGen R&D Plan and linked them with the research focus areas (RFAs) of the ATM-Airspace Project.This analysis relied on practitioner knowledge, NASA program planning data, ongoing research activities, and NextGen objectives and technology needs.Additionally, the project milestones were analyzed with respect to their stated objectives, timeframes, and outcomes and were compared with the specific requirements of each of the R&D needs.As a result of this analysis, each of the project milestones within each RFA was shown to be associated with NextGen R&D needs, and each R&D need within the scope of the ATM-Airspace Project was supported by one or more milestones.The results show that the NASA ATM-Airspace Project is very closely aligned with the documented NextGen R&D needs.Each NASA milestone will directly provide information that is required to satisfy NextGen R&D needs, and all but two milestones support two or more R&D needs, demonstrating the robustness of the activities of the project.Thus, the ATM-Airspace Project is shown to address every R&D need assigned to NASA by the IWP and within the project's responsibilities.Analysis of the linkages established by the analysis shows that the ATM-Airspace Project supports 54 R&D needs and 48 operational improvements (OIs) identified in the IWP.Within the IWP functional area most closely related to air traffic issues, Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support, the project directly supports 45 R&D needs and 42 associated OIs.In addition, the seven RFAs provide broad support for R&D needs and OIs in the Weather Information Services, Safety Management, and Environmental Management Framework functional areas.
SecurityNextGen will establish an effective security system by embedding security measures throughout the air transportation system from curb to curb, delivering security without creating undue delays, limiting access, or adding excessive costs and time.Command and control protocols will allow agencies to retain responsibility while enabling a coordinated national response to protect the homeland against all threats.Security strategies will be tailored to address a wider range of threats, considering cost and impact on operations and ensuring that security solutions are well balanced.
SafetyAir travel will remain the world's safest form of transportation.A more comprehensive safety approach will be implemented by all parties involved in aviation.This approach changes the regulatory authority's role from testing, inspecting, and certifying individual system elements to comprehensive approval and periodic audits of safety management programs within the civil aviation industry.Responsibility for safety risk management and design assurance will reside with the aviation industry, within appropriate rules and oversight.
AirportsThe airport infrastructure to meet future demand will be developed by empowering local communities and regions to create alternative concepts for use and management of airports.Arrival and departure capacity at busy airports will increase through greater use of parallel runways, relaxation of single-runway occupancy restrictions, and improved wake vortex sensing and prediction systems integrated with automated approach, landing, and departure systems.Multiple airports in a geographic region will maintain positive community relationships and coordinate planning to provide a range of facilities that balance transportation needs with environmental standards for noise and emissions.Airports and air traffic services will use marketbased mechanisms such as peak period pricing to ease congestion and ensure that maximum economic value is obtained from available resources.
Aircraft OperationsFuture aircraft will sense, control, communicate, and navigate with increasing levels of autonomy, enabling new concepts in air traffic management.Flight deck automation will reduce the potential for aircraft to maneuver into unsafe situations, preventing controlled flight into terrain, aircraft collisions, and airspace violations.Global procedures for operating and spacing aircraft based on the capability of an individual aircraft and the flight crew's operational performance will promote common operations worldwide.
Air Traffic ManagementNextGen will change the air traffic management paradigm, enabling the provision of services to airspace users on-demand from any geographical location.In addition, the air traffic management system will be enhanced by several key features, including:Reduced separation standards Flexible spacing and sequencing of aircraft on the ground and in the air New equipment, procedures, and infrastructure, enabling increased use of underutilized airspace, airports, and runways Reduced impact of weather through a systemwide capability for enhanced weather observations and forecasts integrated with the tools used by air operators.To accommodate shifts in demand from a wide variety of users, air traffic control will migrate from control of individual flights to air traffic management whereby airspace is allocated based on traffic flows.The role of dispatchers, flight planners, controllers, and flow managers will emphasize end-to-end strategic flow management with minimal individual flight interventions.Decisionmakers will use information management systems to collaborate, develop, and update flow plans and to react and recover from system disruptions.
A.2 NextGen Concept of OperationsThe Concept of Operations (ConOps) for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, Version 2.0, was released by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) on June 13, 2007.This document provides an operational point of view of how the goals and objectives of NextGen will be met by the system envisioned for 2025.In many cases this document presents "aggressive" concepts that have not yet been validated, but are envisioned to maximize benefits and flexibility for NextGen users.
NextGen Operational NeedsNextGen operational needs stem not only from the expectation to accommodate up to three times today's traffic levels, but also from the need to accommodate a wide variety of users with broad aircraft performance envelopes and diverse operational needs within the same airspace.Future users are expected to represent varying levels of total system performance via onboard capabilities and associated crew training.Many aircraft will be able to perform airborne selfseparation, spacing, and merging tasks and precisely navigate and execute four-dimensional trajectories (4DTs).Aircraft will also have varying levels of ability for transmission and receipt of cooperative surveillance information and weather information, as well as a wide range of capabilities for cruise speed, cruise altitudes, turn rates, climb and descent rates, stall speeds, noise, and emissions.Aircraft operators will have a diverse range of capabilities and operating modes and will consequently pose varied operational demands.Another major aspect of NextGen is providing environmental protection that allows sustained growth of aviation.Community noise and impacts on local air quality must be reduced compared to today, despite the increased traffic volume.
Key CharacteristicsNextGen combines advanced technologies and operational capabilities, innovative ATM concepts, environmental improvements in airframe and engine technology, appropriate policy approaches, and financial support to meet these needs.Its key characteristics, as described in the ConOps, are summarized in the section which follows.User Focus.A major theme of NextGen is an emphasis on more flexibility and information to users while reducing the need for government intervention and control of resources.NextGen provides greater situational awareness and data accessibility, and it aligns government structures, processes, strategies, and business practices with customer needs.Multiple service levels permit a wide range of tailored services to satisfy individual user needs and investment choices.Capacity is expanded to meet demand by investing in new infrastructure, shifting NextGen resources (e.g., airspace structures and other assets) to meet demand, implementing more efficient procedures (e.g., safely reducing separation between aircraft to increase throughput), and minimizing the effects of constraints such as weather.Distributed Decisionmaking.As far as possible, decisions in NextGen are made at the local level, with an awareness of systemwide implications and guided by NAS-wide objectives.Local decisionmaking includes an increased level of participation by the flight crew and Flight Operations Centers (FOCs).Stakeholder decisions are supported through access to a rich information exchange environment and transformed collaborative decisionmaking that allow wide access to information by all parties while satisfying privacy and security constraints.With more timely access to information, increased situational awareness, and consistency of information for all decisionmakers, decisions can be made more quickly, required lead times for implementation can be reduced, responses can be more specific, and solutions can be more flexible to change.Integrated Safety Management System.NextGen applies an integrated Safety Management System (SMS) approach to identify and manage potential problems.This approach to managing safety risk includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies for safety management.Safety policy defines how the organization will manage safety as an integral part of its operations.Safety risk management is applied to identify and assess hazards and control the risk.Safety assurance ensures that organizational products or services meet or exceed safety requirements.Safety promotion is used to promulgate safety information and strengthen the safety culture.International Harmonization.The ATM system is globally harmonized through collaborative development and implementation of identified best practices.International harmonization includes advocating for the highest operational standards for aircraft operators and air navigation service providers to ensure the safety of the global air transportation system.ICAO Planning and Implementation Regional Groups or multilateral agreements harmonize planning and implementation of NextGen transformations.Taking Advantage of Human and Automation Capabilities.NextGen capitalizes on the combination of human and automation capabilities to enhance airspace capacity, aviation safety, and operational efficiency.Humans do what they do best -choose alternatives and make decisions -and help automation functions accomplish what they do best: acquire, compile, monitor, evaluate, and exchange information.Research and analysis will determine the appropriate functional allocation of tasks among air navigation service providers, flight operators, and automation and determine when decision support tools are necessary to support humans and which functions should be completely automated without human intervention.Weather Operations.In the NextGen environment, weather information is integrated with and supports NextGen automation and human decisionmaking processes.A common weather picture used by all stakeholders facilitates improved communications and information sharing.Weather data is translated into information directly relevant to NextGen users and service providers.Flight trajectory plans are developed with an increased understanding of the potential severity and probability of weather hazards.As a result, less airspace is constrained because of weather.Decision support systems directly incorporate weather data.Probabilistic forecasts to address weather uncertainty and improved forecast accuracy further minimize the effects of weather on NextGen operations.Environmental Management Framework.Environmental management enables capacity increases consistent with environmental goals.An integrated suite of new technologies, procedures, and policies minimizes community noise and adverse impacts on local air quality and mitigates water quality impacts, energy use, and climate effects.NextGen environmental compatibility is achieved through a combination of improvements in aircraft design, aircraft performance and operational procedures, land use around airports, and policies and incentives to accelerate technology introduction into the fleet.Intelligent flight planning and improved flight management enable optimal route selection and approach and landing procedures.
Robustness and Resiliency.NextGen is more resilient in responding to failures and disruptions, including contingency measures to provide maximum continuity of service in the face of major outages, natural disasters, security threats, or other unusual circumstances.Increased reliance on automation is coupled with fail-safe modes that do not require full reliance on human cognition as a backup for automation failures.NextGen maintains a balance of reliability, redundancy, and procedural backups, providing a system that not only has high availability, but also requires minimal time to restore failed functionality.Scalability.NextGen is adaptable to meet the changes in traffic load and demand that occur day to day or over the decades to come.Increased use of automation, reduced separation standards, super-density arrival and departure operations, and use of additional runways allow busy airports to move a large number of aircraft through the terminal airspace during peak traffic periods.New capabilities, such as virtual towers, enable the cost-effective expansion of services to a significantly larger number of airports than is possible with current methods of service delivery.
ATM TransformationsAs stated in the preface to the ConOps document, the development of the ConOps is an iterative and evolutionary process.Consequently, the current version focuses on capabilities and concepts, rather than detailed procedures.The specificity of the ConOps is expected to increase in step with the development of the Integrated Work Plan and the incorporation of stakeholder feedback, lessons learned, evolution of user and public needs, and development of new technologies.A major focus of the ConOps is and will continue to be the transformation of air traffic management.Table A-II, below, summarizes the major transformative capabilities described in the ConOps.
Table A-II Comparison of NextGen and Current ATM Capabilities
Current Capability 2025 NextGen Capability
Roles and Responsibilities• Primary roles for ATC services are air traffic controllers and ATM specialists.• Demand/capacity imbalances are managed through broad flow contingency initiatives.• New ANSP roles focus on CM, FCM, and TM.• DSTs enable more strategic decision-making.• Air traffic controllers continue to serve classic airspace.
Collaborative Air Traffic Management• Focus is on managing demand to meet available capacity.• ATM initiatives are conservative and broad.• Communications are usually verbal and written.• Conservative measures are used to manage uncertainty caused by weather and other capacity constraints.• Focus is on allocating NAS assets to maximize capacity to meet user demand.• There is better decision support and integrated strategic and traffic flow management (TFM).• There is better use capacity in presence of uncertainty.• A broader set of flight operators participates in C-ATM process.
Integration Across Strategic and Tactical Decision Horizons• Stakeholders have limited ability to exchange data supporting integrated decision-making.• Uncertainties in demand, weather, and flight trajectories are cognitively handled by ANSP personnel using operational judgment.• SSA and integrated impact assessment tools provide stakeholders with common awareness of situations and impacts of decisions.• Automation incorporates probabilistic data to reduce likelihood of overly conservative decisions.
Trajectory-Based Operations• Flights are managed via verbal delivery of clearances and vectors.• Time-based metering is used in some localities to improve predictability and throughput.• Required navigation performance (RNP) operations are used initially to manage complexity and increase capacity.• Flights are managed through use of 4DTs that specify accurate current and future aircraft position.• Metering, controlled time of arrival (CTA) exchange, and more flight-specific adjustments increase overall throughput and operator efficiency.• Safety, security, and environmental considerations are integrated in TBO.• Flight crew-initiated, dynamic trajectory adjustment is possible with ATM and airport operations center (AOC) collaboration.
Dynamic Resource and Airspace Management• Airspace classification is largely fixed, with Earthreferenced boundaries.Sectors may be combined during low demand.Class B and C airspace volumes are defined to protect all possible runway configurations and to match charting capabilities.• Delivery of services is constrained by geographic location of physical facilities.• Airspace allocation is flexible over different time horizons and geographic boundaries to meet demand.Airspace restrictions for aircraft capability are applied only when needed (e.g., for capacity, safety).• Changes to airspace configuration are provided dynamically to flight crews so that maximum flexibility is possible.• Delivery of services is flexible and not constrained by geographic location of personnel and infrastructure.• Weather information is integrated into automation, improving decision-making.• Forecast and current weather measurements are improved.• Operations are supported independent of visibility and make better use of forecast uncertainties.
Separation Management• Tactical separation by individual controller visualizing aircraft trajectories on radar screen and issuing voice instructions limits throughput and flight efficiency.• DSTs provide controllers with strategic awareness of future conflicts and provide capability to evaluate alternative solutions.• Separation standards are relatively fixed.• Separation provision, both airborne or by ANSP, relies heavily on automation support, allowing reduced and performance-based separation standards for different airspace categories.• 4DTs of many aircraft following similar routes may be aligned to nearly eliminate conflicts.• Trajectory changes required for separation assurance are communicated digitally.
A.3 NextGen R&D PlanThe
R&D Plan OverviewConsistent with its purpose, the R&D Plan addresses research issues associated with the ConOps and identifies specific R&D needs.The R&D Plan is organized in terms of 12 R&D areas that were obtained by considering the Solution Sets established in the FAA Operational Evolution Partnership (OEP).For each R&D area, key NextGen challenges are captured as a set of problem areas.Within each problem area, the R&D Plan presents a hierarchy of outcomes, objectives, and R&D needs.The outcomes are defined as the desired changes in operations, independent of the solutions being pursued.R&D objectives capture major solutions necessary to achieve the desired outcomes.The R&D needs represent knowledge required to achieve the outcomes and objectives.Each R&D need consists of a statement of what the need is, when it is needed, and what agencies will participate in its accomplishment.These R&D needs are the final product of the flowdown and provide the information to which the NASA research may be compared to ascertain its relevance.
NextGen EpochsTo make the transformation to NextGen more understandable and manageable, the R&D Plan introduces the concept of phases, or Epochs, corresponding to major steps in the maturation of research to implementation.Epoch 1 (FY 2007-2011), focuses on developing and implementing mature foundational technologies, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Required Navigation Performance (RNP), System-Wide Information Management (SWIM), Data Communications (DataComm), and NextGen Network-Enabled Weather (NNEW).It is also a critical period for research and development, in which long-term capabilities are better defined and development activities reduce risk and inform decisions concerning mid-term deployments.Epoch 2 (FY 2012-2018) builds on this foundation to enable aviation to grow in response to market conditions and passenger demands rather than reacting to constraints of air traffic management.The introduction of automation and new procedures allows pilots to play a more active role in the system through delegated spacing, merging, and passing.The expansion of precision navigation, implementation of advanced weather capabilities and advanced data communications, and development of the critical infrastructure for operations in high-density areas will result in greater operational flexibility and efficiency.NextGen trajectories will be exchanged via datalink, enabling trajectory-based operations and enhancing the integration of flow management with air traffic control.Collaboration and decisionmaking will be seamless across domains, allowing efficient airborne flow programs that reduce the impacts of weather.Epoch 3 (FY 2019-2025) expands NextGen capabilities into a nationwide system, resulting in a cohesive architecture that allows aviation services to be adapted and tailored to accommodate varying operational needs and demand profiles.It solidifies, expands, and fine-tunes the changes made in Epoch 2 and completes the extension of NextGen to secondary airports.It also allows more complex high-density operations across the system to take full advantage of the available airspace and the precision provided by satellite-based technologies.
Summary of R&D NeedsThe R&D Plan presents the R&D needs organized according to the R&D areas derived from the OEP Solution Sets.These needs are summarized below for each of the 12 R&D areas.Although not all the R&D areas represent a focus for the ATM-Airspace Project, certain project activities may play a supporting role.
Trajectory-based OperationsTrajectory-based operations (TBO) represent a shift from clearance-based to trajectory-based control.Aircraft will fly negotiated trajectories, and ATC will transition to management-bytrajectory.The traditional roles of pilots and controllers will evolve as automation and new procedures support the transition.Managing traffic by trajectory will increase capacity and allow more operators to fly preferred, fuel-efficient routes within constraints such as weather.Major research focuses on integrating the dual use of 4DT for clearances and dynamic airspace planning, coupled with alternative roles in maintaining separation assurance for avionics, aircraft operators, ground automation, and service providers.Research to integrate the planning and clearance aspects of 4DT must also focus on when to use airspace structure and when to use self-separation.Substantial research on delegating merging, spacing, and separation tasks and the allocation of control responsibilities among pilots, controllers, and automated systems is essential to developing performance-based separation procedures.
Reduced Impact of WeatherToday, weather data are not well integrated into automated decision support systems, are not readily available to all decisionmakers, and are not sufficiently accurate.NextGen decision support systems will integrate weather information, along with probabilistic forecasts, to better manage weather impacts and enable proactive planning.The most significant research will determine the accuracy and other characteristics of an authoritative weather information source for decisionmaking.The structure will be put in place to manage the development, authorization, standards, policy, and certification of the virtual NextGen Network-Enabled Weather system to leverage the development of net-enabled weather observations and probabilistic weather forecasts and to provide a common authoritative source of current and forecasted weather information.
Flexible Terminal Airspace and Expanded Airport AccessTo meet the growth in traffic demand, NextGen will rely on the expanded use of secondary and reliever airports and fuller use of all airports in most weather conditions.Capabilities that will accommodate higher traffic levels include more reliable access in low-visibility conditions and more flexible use of terminal airspace to meet traffic demand.Improved pilot and controller situational awareness will allow flexibility in air traffic service delivery.Flexibility in using terminal airspace will stem from changes in provisions for air traffic services at a local level to take advantage of improved situational awareness and trajectory-based operations.These services will include Area Navigation (RNAV)/RNP routings, continuous descent approaches, dynamic terminal airspace, and other performance-based procedures.Research will address performance gains that can result from flexible airspace structures and the means for dynamically adjusting airspace allocations.Other research will focus on use of continuous descent arrivals in high-density terminal airspace and on addressing aircraft wake turbulence in establishing new trajectory-based or display-enhanced procedures.Initial efforts will identify the requirements to incorporate this functionality into ground management of the trajectory, with subsequent research addressing options to move it to the cockpit display.
High Density Terminal and Airport OperationsPeak throughput is critical in high-density airspace.High-density airports are characterized by a high demand for runway access and multiple runways with airspace and taxiing interactions, and their proximity to other airports can result in airspace or approach interference.These airports will require integrated tactical and strategic flow capabilities in addition to all the capabilities of flexible terminals and airspace.They might also require higher performance navigation and communications.New procedures will be needed to improve airport surface movements, reduce spacing and separation requirements, and improve traffic flows.Research will establish cases or conditions that warrant performance-based separation standards, including what must be done to increase throughput on the surface and individual runways, manage closely spaced parallel operations or multiple runway operations, and coordinate separation in the transition airspace of a metropolitan area.Research into the use of onboard displays in combination with 4DT-based separation will feed into development of the necessary avionics and ground infrastructure.
Collaborative Air Traffic ManagementToday's air traffic control system uses relatively coarse tools to manage imbalances between demand and capacity.The objective of collaborative air traffic management is to accommodate operators' preferences to the extent possible and impose restrictions only when necessary.This concept strives to adjust airspace and other resources to support demand, rather than constraining demand to match available assets.If constraints are required, the goal is to maximize operators' opportunities to resolve them.Research focuses on refining the understanding of uncertainty in forecasting weather and demand, their impacts on capacity and safety, and options for automating detection and resolution.This research will build on discoveries from earlier steps and is essential for tailoring weather services to best serve their intended uses.Research in trajectory and flow management will focus on developing an integrated, collaborative ATM capability that provides usable information based on forecast traffic, system configuration, and weather, and on probabilistic tools that allow decisionmakers to analyze alternatives for addressing operational disruptions.
SafetyNextGen requires a fundamental change in safety management.To maintain or improve on today's low accident rates with the much higher traffic volumes and densities projected for NextGen will require an even greater level of safety than is present in the current system.Today's reactive data analysis must evolve into prognostic evaluations to address safety risks in a higher capacity, increasingly complex operating environment.This will require a formal, systematic, business-like approach to managing safety risk, embodied in the form of Safety Management Systems (SMSs).Safety research will focus on procedures, technologies, and automated recovery capabilities to address the most significant safety hazards, including loss of control, weather encounters, and mechanical failures.This research leads to applications in aircraft and avionics at the beginning of the third epoch.
Layered, Adaptive SecurityLayered, adaptive security is a risk-informed system that depends on multiple technologies, policies, or procedures, scaled and arranged to deter, prevent, detect, defeat, or mitigate a given threat.The National Strategy for Aviation Security states that "a layered approach to aviation security means further applying some measures of security to each of the following points: transportation; staff; passengers; conveyances; access control; cargo and baggage; airports; and in-flight security [to] allow for resilience against expected and unexpected attack scenarios."
EnvironmentChanges in technology, aircraft operations, procedures, and environmental practices are necessary to mitigate the significant environmental effects that will result from increased air transportation.The primary environmental concerns arise from impacts on community noise, local air quality, global climate, water quality, and energy production and consumption.The NextGen environmental management framework considers the interdependencies among the many environmental issues, so that in addressing some, others are not exacerbated.The NextGen environmental challenge is to manage the environmental effects of aviation in a manner that reduces or limits their impacts while allowing sustained aviation growth.Research on tools for analysis of noise and emissions will allow 4D trajectories and traffic flows to be considered in airport planning.Research is also needed to provide a better understanding of the health and welfare effects of noise, local air quality, and global emissions and to translate these into environmental standards.
Transformed FacilitiesNextGen leads to a more seamless view of air traffic, organized not by geographic sectors, but by aircraft trajectories.Automation and other supporting infrastructure will be designed to support this operational concept.Facilities and the personnel who staff them must also evolve from a geographical focus to a broader concept for air traffic management.The most significant research concerns efficiency and productivity improvements for delivering air traffic services, including facility-independent techniques and practices and methods for dynamically allocating demand to air traffic management personnel; this research will drive the roles of facilities and personnel for NextGen operations.Another key research priority is to understand the extent of the need for dynamic allocation of airspace and resources.
Aircraft, Operator, and Air Transportation UserThis area focuses on changes in the aircraft or operator support environment through fundamental capabilities beyond individual enhancements to safety, security, environment, or air traffic management.The transition to NextGen will require a suite of improvements to airframes and avionics, and the capability to reduce the time required to make changes.Airframe changes include vehicle enhancements that support NextGen operations and the management and operation of remotely piloted or uncrewed aerial systems (UASs).Research will focus on control systems and sense-and-avoid capabilities for UASs, and avionics development will benefit and borrow from developments of 4DT operations in low visibility and the virtual-tower concept.
Airport and Air Transportation InfrastructureAirports are the nexus of many transformational elements of NextGen, but the structure of this element is very complex.While the Airport Improvement Program funds some airport improvements, airport development is generally controlled and funded locally.Airport safety and design standards are federally regulated, but airports are owned, managed, and operated at the local level.To handle the increased demand of aircraft, passengers, and cargo, airport operators must integrate requirements for security, the environment, and air traffic operations.
Crosscutting Research and DevelopmentAlthough human factors is an essential part of many concepts described in the R&D Plan, it is addressed in this section to highlight its importance and wide applicability.Crosscutting research will also be needed to model NextGen mission needs and to continually assess performance implications of a changing operational environment.
Sample Description of R&D NeedsEach R&D need is described in terms of the need, the date by which it is needed, the lead and participating agencies in its development, and which operational improvements it supports.Each R&D need is also given a number for data handling and traceability; research needs are identified with the prefix R, development needs are identified with the prefix D.  Each functional area is described in terms of operational improvements and the enablers, R&D activities, capital improvements, policies, and decisions that are needed to realize each operational improvement.The R&D activities in the IWP correspond to the R&D needs expressed in the R&D Plan, the change in designation from need to activity reflecting the intent of the IWP as a plan for actions rather than a set of requirements.
Operational Improvements and Associated ActivitiesOperational improvements (OIs) provide the core framework for NextGen.OIs describe an improved level of performance or specific capability of NextGen operations.They are realized through the combination of one or more enablers as well as one or more R&D activities, investments, policy elements, or decisions.They can also be supported by the achievement of one or more prerequisite OIs.Enablers describe the fundamental functional elements of the NextGen enterprise, such as communication, navigation, and surveillance systems.OIs and enablers have an initial operating capability (IOC) date or availability date, respectively, and other activities have a specified completion date.As shown in Figure A-2, below, operational improvements can support other operational improvements, and, likewise, enablers can support other enablers.Any of the activities can support a number of enablers or operational improvements.
Figure A-2 Integrated Work Plan Data ElementsBecause of the complexity of NextGen, each OI usually requires several enablers, R&D activities, policy decisions, and investments. Figure A-3, below, illustrates the various elements that support an OI by describing the enablers, key decisions, policy issues, and R&D activities that are required to implement a representative OI: in this case, OI-0355, En Route Airborne Merging and Spacing.In addition to the activities shown in the table, this OI is supported by seven investments, as described in the IWP.

R&D ActivitiesThe R&D activities in each functional area are aligned with OIs and enablers to describe the dependencies and sequencing necessary to achieve NextGen in a timely and efficient manner.The R&D activities of interest to the ATM-Airspace Project are covered in the IWP sections for the functional areas Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support, Weather Information Services, Safety Management, and Environmental Management Framework.Since the R&D activities for the IWP are drawn from the R&D needs specified in the R&D Plan for FY 2009-2013, they emphasize near-term needs, but they do include all R&D that is necessary within that time frame, including R&D activities that extend to completion beyond FY 2013.The discussion which follows summarizes the thrust of the R&D activities relevant to ATM-Airspace Project research; the IWP includes more specific descriptions of each of the 167 R&D activities.The following paragraphs summarize the research and development topics described in the IWP for each of the major functional areas of NextGen:Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support Airport Operations and Support Weather Information Services Safety Management Layered Adaptive Security Environmental Management Framework Net-Centric Infrastructure Services Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services Surveillance Services detection, notification, coordination, and resolution will result in procedures to account for realtime assessments of the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic weather forecasts.Other significant tradeoffs to be considered include the allocation of airspace among classes of users, among airports in a metro area, and between military and civil purposes when there is a capacity gap.Research on airspace structures and collaborative planning will contribute to defining 4DT allocation schemes for collaborative planning by 2015.This decision in turn will drive the research to define what specific airspace structures (such as flow corridors, selfseparation, and special use airspace) are needed to support trajectory-based operations.This research will allow development of ATM-wide procedures and common automation, as well as specific solutions such as virtual towers, by 2015.With potentially significant negotiations and separation management functions involving the cockpit, modular or incrementally upgradeable avionics and accelerated certification will be needed for timely transition.By 2012, research will establish the basis for development and certification of elements of system-of-systems in a piecewise fashion to enable routine upgrades.Such a capability will be useful in implementing the avionics suites to enable performance-based separation procedures.Research into the role assigned to the aircraft in separation assurance in conjunction with or in lieu of trajectory-based operations will define the avionics requirements.By 2015, research will address cockpit technologies and procedures for very closely spaced parallel, triple, and quadruple runways.In 2018, development of a second round of tools and network facility capabilities will allow capacity to be expanded and complexity to be managed in high-density environments through means such as performance-based separation standards and 4DT for separation assurance.
Flight Operations and SupportFlight operations and support research will focus on weather detection, mitigation, and avoidance and on reducing separation of aircraft to account for the effects of wake vortex.Research will also support selection and prioritization of alternative aircraft capabilities, development of policy for standards development and certification, and formulation of policies regarding incentives or access-based mandates for airborne capabilities through 2020.These research efforts will consider the operational diversity of commercial, military, business aviation, and general aviation operations.An additional topic is applied research on staffed and automated virtual tower options and other mechanisms to expand service to more airports.
Airport Operations and SupportThe most significant challenges for airport operation will be to find methods for increasing throughput of passengers, baggage, and cargo through the terminals, including security and Customs and Border Protection.The most significant research will focus on what information and tools are necessary for more robust calculations of the interdependencies among system components, including environmental effects and the integration of airport data such as surface conditions and deicing operations into real-time management of airside and landside resources This research will support mid-term implementation of airport operations tools to support the expected throughput based on all relevant parameters.Another research area is the investigation of pavement options that would reduce down time due to ice or snow removal.Figure 2 . 2 - 1221Figure 2.2-1 ATM-Airspace Project Decomposition Levels

Itbegins with a discussion of the TPSU research activities that apply to the four NextGen functionalareas and subareas of interest and concludes with a direct mapping of milestones to R&D needs.The TPSU activities that support the Air Navigation Operations subarea include:Development and validation of vertical and horizontal profile algorithms foroverconstrained trajectory parameters and for modeling multiple altitude and speedconstraints of arbitrary order.Development of vertical and horizontal profile algorithms to model complexcombinations of trajectory constraints stemming from NextGen 4D trajectory-basedoperations.Validation of initial trajectory modeling methods for representing NextGen-relevantapproach and departure procedures.Survey and advance algorithms for predicting and describing propagation of trajectoryuncertainty.Development of methodologies to account for trajectory prediction uncertainty inairborne conflict management to reduce the number of missed and false conflict alerts.The Air Navigation Support subarea sets forth several R&D needs related to designing andmanaging structured airspace. Within the TPSU RFA there is considerable work to address thisneed; the complete set, in terms of milestones, appears in Table 2.4.1-II, below. A paraphrasedsample of the milestones includes:Document the trajectory prediction and modeling algorithms and software capabilityrequirements envisioned to support NextGen automation systemsDevelop algorithms for measuring differences among 4D trajectories

Weather Information Services needs center on the development of a four-dimensional weather information system that provides information tailored to ATM procedures, and on development of the first generation of probabilistic weather forecasts (R-0580, D-0850).R&D needs related to Safety Management include research and development of system risk assessment and management models and research on risk-reducing systems interfaces, procedures, and training to reduce human error (D-1700, D-1710).Environmental Management Framework needs include the investigation of operational approaches that reduce noise, impact on local air quality, and potential for greenhouse gas emissions (D-1730).SLDAST work addressing R&D needs in the Weather Information Services functional area will develop a refined system-level concept of operations based on results of modeling, safety analysis, cost-benefits analysis, and human-in-the-loop simulations.
Safety Management functional area research activities include the following:Develop method for modeling human workload in fast-time simulations, and validate models against workload measurements.Conduct objective analysis of service provider and aircraft operator separation assurance methods.Develop a refined system-level concept of operations based on results of modeling, safety analysis, cost-benefits analysis, and human-in-the-loop simulations.R&D needs in the Environmental Management Framework functional area are addressed by the following activity: Develop an initial system-level concept of operations, leveraging the NextGen ConOps and expanding development as required to support Airspace Systems Program research and concept development.Table 2.4.7-II, which follows, shows the SLDAST milestones that address the R&D needs summarized above.
APPENDIX A -SUMMARY OF KEY NEXTGEN DOCUMENTS A.1 National PlanThe Integrated Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, also called the National Plan, was submitted to the Congress on December 12, 2004, fulfilling a requirement of P.L. 108-176, the Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act.This legislation called for an integrated plan to meet the Nation's long-term needs for air transportation safety, security, mobility, efficiency, and capacity.
The NextGen VisionThe National Plan sets forth a vision for an integrated system for 2025 capable of handling up to three times the current volume of air traffic.The air traffic management paradigm in use today dates from the 1930s; NextGen will revolutionize this paradigm with new technologies, concepts, and operational procedures.A major consideration is the leveraging of private sector capabilities as well as those of the Federal agencies involved, allowing industry to provide cost effective solutions within a performance-based set of safety, security, and environmental rules.Improvements in air traffic management systems will result from employing advanced information management technology, enhanced sensor and detection capabilities, upgraded aircraft performance, and more accurate and tailored weather forecasts.Multilayered systems based on new technologies and up-to-the-minute information will ensure America's security.Safety will be designed into every air transportation component.Airports will increase capacity while offering convenience and security for travelers and shippers.The air transportation system will take full advantage of enhanced aircraft capabilities, but it will also accommodate aircraft with a wide variety of performance characteristics and less sophisticated equipage.The concept of airline schedules will be redefined as the boundaries between traditional carriers and on-demand service providers begin to merge.An abundance of options will enable customers to choose air transportation services tailored to their needs.The predictability of air travel will increase, and, while delays will never be completely eliminated, NextGen travelers and shippers will have the best information to make alternative decisions in real time.
Goals and ObjectivesThe National Plan establishes the 6 top-level goals and 19 subsidiary objectives for NextGen shown in Table A-I, below.
Table A-I NextGen Goals and Objectives
Goals ObjectivesGoal
NextGen ConceptsNextGen will adapt to future demands by using new concepts, technologies, networks, policies, and business models.The National Plan describes the impact of these innovations as they will affect the major elements of the air transportation system.
Flight OperationsFlight procedures will be tailored to aircraft and aircrew performance.Increased automation combined with new procedures will release ties to geographical airspace.NextGen will be integrated through the ability to share timely, accurate information with a common operational picture via secure data link, air-to-ground communication systems, and airborne Internet.All operators will be afforded access according to their differing levels of capability.Closer spacing of aircraft tailored to capabilities and conditions will enable an increase in capacity.New technologies and operational procedures will eliminate the differences between procedures for instrument meteorological conditions and visual meteorological conditions.
IWP OverviewThe Integrated Work Plan describes NextGen research, policy and implementation activities, including schedules, and their dependencies.As such, it provides a collaborative planning and management tool for all of the mission partners.The research activities are derived from the R&D needs identified in the R&D Plan dated February 15, 2008.The scope of the IWP is broader, however, since it contains the full spectrum of work required by NextGen.In addition to its added scope, the IWP shows the dependencies among R&D and other implementation activities.The IWP is the governing JPDO document, and thus supersedes the R&D Plan.As with the R&D Plan, the IWP provides the fundamental information to which the ATM-Airspace Project must respond if its research is to be aligned with NextGen.The IWP is organized around the major functional areas of the NextGen enterprise, which were derived from the ConOps and enterprise architecture.These functional areas are:Trajectory
Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and SupportThe Trajectory-Based and Performance-Based Operations and Support functional area is subdivided into Air Navigation Operations, Air Navigation Support, and Flight Operations and Support.
Air Navigation OperationsThe primary research for Air Navigation Operations will define the best way to implement 4D trajectory (4DT) operations.By 2012 the first round of research in this area will integrate 4DT planning with the separation assurance function in terminal airspace.Development of standards for integrated navigation, communications, and flight controls to fly precise trajectories will follow by 2015.The 4DT functionality is strongly affected by the separation assurance roles of aircraft operator, ground automation, and service provider.Responsibility assignments for separation will depend on specific separation situations and the need for reductions in spacing to safely increase capacity.By 2012, research will determine the merits of the various ground, aircraft, and automation separation management options.The selected separation procedures will influence the requirements for negotiating flexible flight-specific trajectories and the use of dynamic airspace structures such as high-density corridors or self-separation airspace.By 2014, research will establish specific procedures for use of 4DT and the interactions between flight trajectory negotiations for individual flights and the use of dynamic airspace structures.With the new allocation of control responsibilities, it will be possible to identify opportunities to gain capacity, safety, or flexibility by establishing performance-based procedures.By 2015, research on control systems, sense-and-avoid capabilities, collision avoidance, and emergency procedures will establish the requirements to incorporate beneficial performance-based procedures into trajectory-based airspace.The most significant challenge will be the system for maintaining the 4DT proposals and agreements across a broad span of time.This system must also account for a probabilistic distribution of capacity resulting from weather and other contingencies.The research in these areas will conclude by 2015 with the establishment of requirements for collaborative automated flight and flow evaluation and resolution.
Air Navigation SupportThe use and extent of dynamic allocation among air navigation services provider (ANSP) facilities enabled by the creation of dynamic airspace structures is the most significant research area for defining the support environment.Flexible allocation of air traffic management resources will drive the networking of systems for information sharing and backup.By 2012, research will determine the methods for dynamic allocation of air traffic management resources and designation of airspace structures such as self-separation areas.By 2013, research will identify facility needs for flexibility in airspace design and techniques for exploiting performance-based trajectories with shifts in ANSP team sizes and skill sets.At the same time, research into how capacity is affected workload allocation and facility configuration will result in tools for matching capacity to demand.These tools will address projected weather impacts, among others.By 2014, research on automated capacity problem
Weather Information ServicesWeather Information Services required for trajectory-based and performance-based operations include a common weather information source for decisionmaking, adaptable observation information, and weather forecast products tailored to their procedural applications.In 2013 the structure will be in place to manage the development, authorization, standards, policy, and certification of the virtual NextGen Network-Enabled Weather (NNEW) to provide a common, single authoritative source of current and forecasted weather information.It will leverage net-enabled weather observations and probabilistic weather forecasts developed by 2012.By 2016 a second round of network-enabled observations and predictive model improvements will be developed to support more advanced flexible airspace and trajectory-based operations.It will use adaptive controls to direct observation sensors on aircraft and satellites in real time.This round will also enable aircraft to participate more fully in the observation network and receive information tailored to performance-based procedures, such as turbulence, wake, or icing data.
Safety ManagementThe NextGen goals are to be achieved through a combination of new policies, procedures, operations, and advances in technology deployed to safely manage passenger, air cargo, general aviation, and air traffic operations.Safety improvements include changes to aircraft and ground systems, manufacturing methods, vehicle and ground systems health management and maintenance, systems to counteract the effects of the environment on operations and, most importantly, human-centered interfaces for air and ground systems.Research is targeted to deliver recommended tools and safeguard solutions for industry consideration around 2015.Since safety is integrated into the creation of new capabilities and procedures, safety-related research and development of analysis techniques must yield the analytical tools and methods by 2012 to assess the operational changes planned as part of NextGen.
Layered Adaptive SecurityIn consonance with the National Strategy for Aviation Security, NextGen will begin by transitioning to integrated management of security risk.An integrated contingency management capability by 2012 will flow from research into specific measures.Starting about 2015, the risk management approach will guide the selection of adaptable new capabilities emerging from research into securing passengers, cargo, airports, aircraft and, airspace.
Environmental Management FrameworkThe primary environmental constraints on the capacity and flexibility of NextGen are community noise, local air quality, global climate impacts, water quality, and energy production and consumption.The NextGen Environmental Management Framework must also account for interdependencies among many environmental issues, so that in addressing some, others are not exacerbated, while ensuring aviation safety, national security, and economic well being.Goals to triple the air traffic capacity depend on the ability to dramatically reduce current levels of aircraft noise, emissions, energy use, and water pollutants.Significant improvements in both vehicles and operations will be required to achieve these goals.Advancements in technology and aircraft operation, more environmentally sustainable air traffic management procedures, and sound environmental practices at airports will also be necessary to counter the environmental pressures on various segments of the national airspace system.
Net-Centric Infrastructure ServicesThe net-centric environment begins with the definition of core services by 2010.Once the services have been defined, requirements for digital exchange of data can be established to replace current point-to-point and verbal communication among stakeholders.The major tradeoffs will determine the need for information timeliness, accuracy, and consistency for each decision-maker.The tools generated must support exchanges that span from planning to real-time operations, and must include ground-ground coordination as well as air-ground coordination.By 2014 the research will establish the information management services to support a comprehensive representation of all 4DT negotiations in progress, flight objects, weather, navigation and surveillance data, and airport and air navigation facility operational data.
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing ServicesThe evolution of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services required to support NextGen will involve development of a national PNT architecture with support from contributing agencies and the National Space Based PNT Coordination Office (NCO) to establish joint programs to provide the necessary infrastructure for NextGen PNT.The primary PNT service provider system of NextGen is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).In the event of a systemwide or localized loss of signal, a backup system will be required.The strategy for determining what this will be and when it must be in place is an ongoing effort that will require conclusion by 2010 in order to allow equipage transition by 2025.In addition to users being dependent on space-based PNT sources, the national architecture also recommends use of terrestrial and autonomous sources integrated with space-based PNT to provide robustness in electromagnetically impeded environments.The National PNT Architecture also acknowledges that specialized solutions will continue to exist where it is either inefficient or inappropriate to provide the required capability more commonly.This applies to providing capabilities for the most stringent precision approach (CAT-III) and low-visibility surface operations; R&D should be conducted to define such needs and determine how best to meet them.
Surveillance ServicesThe major research topic will be the tradeoffs to determine the available sources of surveillance data and their appropriateness in terms of accuracy and timeliness for different operator and facility functions.The research will identify the needs for both cooperative and noncooperative surveillance for security and air traffic management to enable investment decisions by 2014.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services, Directorate for information Operations and Reports (0704-0188), 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1204, Arlington, VA 22202-4302.Respondents should be aware that notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if it does not display a currently valid OMB control number.The research focus areas (RFAs) of the ATM-Airspace Project were analyzed with respect to the NextGen R&D needs.Based on this analysis, this report identifies the NextGen R&D needs that are supported by each RFA, as well as the linkage between the milestones in each RFA and the R&D needs.
APPENDIX B -LIST OF ACRONYMS
PLEASE DO NOT RETURN YOUR FORMIt was found that there is close alignment between the project's research activities and the NextGen R&D needs.All of the project's 118 milestones are shown to be directly linked to NextGen R&D needs.Furthermore, by virtue of the fundamental nature of the NASA research, all but two of the milestones support multiple NextGen needs, demonstrating the project's robust applicability.

Brown , Fiona Auty, Eugenio Renedo, Mike King NCSLI Measure | Vol. 13 No. 1 (2021) | doi.org/10.51843/measure.13.1.1 Publisher NCSL International | Published February 2021 | Pages 18-21 Abstract: This paper describes the many, evidenced-based benefits to the economy of a well-developed measurement infrastructure. In particular, it explains how assuring confidence in measurement may be used to accelerate economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic including in emerging sectors such as the digital economy. Recommendations are made for providing near term support for national economic recovery whilst also demonstrating the advantages of sustained development of the measurement infrastructure in the medium-term to maximize the potential of future innovative and disruptive technologies. These recommendations, whilst focused on consideration of the UK, should apply globally. References: [1] G. Tassey, "Underinvestment in public good technologies," J Technol.

The verification is done by calibrating the specified parameters and comparing with the requirements stated in the standard. The parameters that should be calibrated are the ratios of the residual voltages to the rated voltage, the accuracy of the phase angle at switching, and the rise time, fall time, overshoot and undershoot of the switching waveform. A specially built adapter is used to convert the high voltage output waveforms of the generators to lower level signals to be acquired by a digital oscilloscope. The other circuits required for the testing are also provided. In addition, the paper discusses the uncertainty evaluations for the measured parameters. References: [1] T. Williams, and K.

In order to validate the photometric method, several micropipettes of different capacities from 0.1 µL to 1000 µL were calibrated using both methods (gravimetric and photometric) in two different laboratories, IPQ (Portuguese Institute for Quality) and Artel. These tests were performed by six different operators. The uncertainty for both methods was determined and it was verified that the uncertainty component that has a higher contribution to the final uncertainty budget depends on the volume delivered. In the photometric method for small volumes, the repeatability of the pipette is the largest uncertainty component, but for volumes, larger than 100 µL, the photometric instrument is the most significant source of uncertainty. Based on all the results obtained with this study, one may consider the photometric method validated. References: [1] ISO 8655-1/2/6/7, Piston-operated volumetric apparatus, 2002.

Greeff NCSLI Measure | Vol. 13 No. 1 (2021) | doi.org/10.51843/measure.13.1.5 Publisher: NCSL International | Published February 2021 | Pages 46-56 Abstract: The additive manufacturing of products promises exciting possibilities. Measurement methodologies, which measure an in-process dataset of these products and interpret the results, are essential. However, before developing such a level of quality assurance several in-process measurands must be realized. One of these is the material flow rate, or rate of adding material during the additive manufacturing process. Yet, measuring this rate directly in material extrusion additive manufacturing presents challenges. This work presents two indirect methods to estimate the volumetric flow rate at the liquefier exit in material extrusion, specifically in Fused Deposition Modeling or Fused Filament Fabrication. The methods are cost effective and may be applied in future sensor integration. The first method is an optical filament feed rate and width measurement and the second is based on the liquefier pressure. Both are used to indirectly estimate the volumetric flow rate. The work also includes a description of linking the G-code command to the final print result, which may be used to create a per extrusion command model of the part. References: [1] T. Wohlers, I.

		(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

All the students from two years master (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction, descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the academic advising style provided to them. Students who satisfied from developmental academic advising style and they were also highly satisfied from the advising provided to them at Personalizing Education (PE) and this is the subscale of developmental academic advising whereas students who received prescriptive academic advising they were also satisfied from the advising provided to them regarding personalizing education and academic decision making but their percentage is less. It is recommended to Universities Administration to focus on Developmental Academic Advising Style and establish centers at universities/department level and nominate staff who may be responsible to provide developmental academic advising.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.

After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects?

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court. Nevertheless, it has some problems. The most important among them is the identification of the witness and an assurance that he is not being prompted when his statement is recorded.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

There had been many crematoriums in the city but with the passage of time, one after another, disappeared from the land after partition of the Sub-continent. Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
