( 1) and (2) allows complete freedom in the choice of model, for the thrust T, drag D, and the wind profile V,..In the simulation thrust, drag and fuel flow model> for a 727 class of aircraft were used.The wind profile can be given as a function of altitude and position along the horizontal path.The value of thrust used in each integration step depend, on the segment type.For acceleration the thrust is set to its maximum; for deceleration, it is set to idle, For constant CAS or constant Mach number segments in descent, the thrust computation is more involved; explicit relations for these cases arc derived in Ref. 7. In general.the thrust will be close to the idle value for the 3 deg descent angle typically used here.The algorithm for determining the speed profile starting at WPS with specified time to fly begins with synthesis of three profiles flown at maximum, minimum, and nominal speeds, V"""' V m ,,, , and V"O"" respectively (see Fig. l).The nominal speed profile is one that the pilot would choose in the absence or any time constraints.By the back ward-forward integration procedure described above, the corresponding times to fly, T".", T",,,, and T"',m' are obtained.Then a test is performed to determine if the specified time, T d , falls within the range (I~",n' 7,,,,;,).Jf such is the case, a polynomial approximation instruments.At 10,000 ft (WP4) the nominal trajectory decelerates to a maximum CAS of 250 knots, in accordance wi: h ATC rules.The 250 knots CAS is held to a point at about 20 n mi.from touchdown (WP3j where a deceleration to 180 knots occurs.At 5 n.mi.from touchdown (W I'2) deceleration to final approach speed occurs with flaps extended to landing configuration.The maximum speed profile shown in the example initially exceeds the speed limit of 250 KCAS below lo.non f1.The algorithm allows the speed to be exceeded with prior approval of the flow controller,The time to traverse the path and the points where speed changes begin and terminate arc obtained by numerically integrating the following two equations along the known three-dimensional O~O) profile.of the exact but unk nowu relation between descent speed and lime ro flv is computed.A simple proportional formula also allows Eq~(3) to determine the speed between \\P4 and V\P3.(3)obtain an estimate the correct deseem speed.Next, the a'2\Ual t ime to fly .iOITCSP'OlJ.(!H\g 1() the cSlimaied descent 'peed IS (;;!cuimed b'J forward-backward synthesis method.I'he on board calculation of a 4-D trajectory is carried out at I he time t he aircraft departs I he feeder fix, located at approximately 120 n.mi, from touchdown, and at a cruise altitude of about 33.000 ft.Calculation is initiated when the simulated onboard system receives specification of touchdown time and approach route.I I' the flight/performance envelope of the aircraft permits it, the system will generate in fast time a time-controlled approach trajectory, starting at the current location of the aircraft and iermiuanng at touchdown, Inability to meet the specified lime causes the system to display an error message at the controller and/or pseudopilot stations.The successfully synthesized trajcctory comprise, a vector function of time whose components are reference values of x and y positions.altitude, heading, and airspeed.Immediately after the rrajcctory has been synthesized in fast time, it is regenerated in real rime, 10 provide continuous updated reference states.The Simulated aircraft tracks the reference states by means of a closed-loop autopilot guidance law, thereby causing it 10 complete the approach trajectory at the assigned time.The problem of synthesiziug such trajectories is divided into three subproblems solved sequentially.First, the horizontal profile is constructed as a sequence of turns and straight lines passing through the set of waypoints that define the approach route."Second, the vertical profile is synthesized as a sequence of level-flight and constant-descentangle segments passing through sped fied altitude waypoints located on the horizontal profile.An alternative to the constant-descent-angle profiles arc idle thrust descents, which can be more nearly fuel optimum.However, pilot preference is somewhat divided between these two strategies.Finally. the airspeed profile is synthesized 10 achieve the specified arrival time.Since the speed profile algorithm was developed specifically for this study, it is discussed in greater detail in the following section, Speed Profile Synlhesis Three types of airspeed profiles typical of those used in the simulation arc illustrated in Fig, 1.All three profiles start at waypoint 5 t WPS) at all altitude of 33,000 fr and at a true airspeed (TAS) of 460 knots, or 280 knots calibrated airspeed (CAS).Constant Mach segments are not shown in these example profiles.The profile labeled nominal starts with a brief segment of deceleration to a CAS or Mach number.computed by the speed selection algorithm.The computed CAS of 265 knots is held const anr during the remainder of cruise and the greater portion of descent until I he H\OOO•ft altitude is reached at WI'4.A descent at constant CAS produces the gradual deceleration seen in Fig. I.This type of nominal speed profile is fairly typical in airline operation because it can be flown by a pilot llsing standard cockpit J. GUIDANCE requirements will not be violated at any point along the common path.In this fashion.assuming the speed profile for the heavy aircraft is the same as that shown for the larue aircraft, the minimum time separation matrix can be determined 10 be (4)   98 74 74   [38 74 74   167 114 94   T=(f,;) where 1,1 is the separation time at touchdown when a type Hi" aircraft lands first, and is directly followed by a type "l" aircraft.and where types l , 2, and 3 designate small, large, and heavy aircraft, respectively.It is assumed that, if two consecutive aircraft are 4-D equipped, the interarrival times given by T can be used for scheduling purposes.However, unequipped aircraft will need additional time buffers ro prevent separation distance violations.If the probability density function of an unequipped aircraft meeting an assigned time via controller vectoring is known (this can be determined in the specific experimental context), then time buffers can be determined to keep the probability of separation distance violation below a desired level.The technique for obtaining these buffers is discussed in Ref. 8. For the purposes of this study.it was assumed that if one of the two consecutive aircraft was unequipped, a lO-s buffer was added to the separation time.If both aircraft are unequipped, a 20-s buffer is added.
Scheduling AlgorithmsThe previous discussion established the time separation matrix at touchdown shown as a function of weight category, and whether or not aircraft are 4-D equipped.It is assumed that the feeder fix time for each aircraft is known.Based on this time and on the desired time 10 traverse the route a desired touchdown time for each aircraft can be determined.Using this first come, first served (FCFS) order and the time separation matrix, the time schedule at touchdown is obtained.It is possible to increase capacity by altering the FCFS order; thus, future studies will incorporate time-slot shifting algorithms to take advantage of bunching of speed classes.However, for purposes of this initial study of operational procedures, the FCl-S order is adequate.In addition to setting up an initial schedule.algorithms are required to revise the schedule.Missed approaches must be accommodated.Also, the controller may need to change the aircraft arrival rate.He also may be required to block out specific time periods from the computer schedule to accornmodale a missed approach or a priority landing.In addition, he may require that a few aircraft be scheduled in a specified order.This schedule manipulation will be illuvt rntcd milH! the hall problem as an example.Suppose Ihal all inii ia! sch~dulc has been c,wblished for IIIOS(' aircraft !hal have departed tile feedcr fix 'denotcd acrivc ~Iircraft) and illu"e which have ntH yel departed rhe feeder fix (denoted inactive aircraf'r ).COIHroilers may need 10 halt the inacivc aircrau for a lime i Illis may be ncccssaiy 10 accommod.uea missed appnlach.A I•cscheduling. aigoriil1ll1 is required which leaves ihe rime a"igmncllis for Ihe active air cruft unaltered, bur which rcvises ihe touchdown Jimes of inactive aircraft bv at leasl Ihis procedure can read 10 a rcordering 01 lhe ,.ch~d ule Table :2 illustr.uc, a I ypical rcvision.For dlthlrative purp<FC< "ircral, arc ,hsumec! 10 be scheduled :2 111111 aparr."1 he crreCI \~r the !ni~:~cd ;lp.prC}~-h.=hi\ in i,eave ac-l ivc aircra fr untouched :.lnd 10 rcvi-.e 1he inactive aircraft s(~hcdtdc by 2-4 min.The 4-D equipped aircraft described in the previous section have the capability of meeting a touchdown-time assignment to an accuracy of a few seconds.It is now desired to use this capability to formulate efficient operational procedures for the time scheduling of all aircraft in the terminal mea.This will be developed in two parts: I) determination of the interarrival time separations for two consecutive aircraft to be used in aircraft scheduling; and 2) development of a scheduling algorithm for assigning landing times.They are generated by the ground computer automatically, but can be altered per controller requirements.r<tble I Minimum separunon dlsl(lllcC Experience with this algorithm has shown that for a 120ñ .mi.vlong trajectory with a nominal flight time of 1,300 s, the descent speed estimate obtained from Eq. (3) will achieve an actual arrival lime withill± 5 s of the desired lime in most cases.This accuracy is adequate for terminal area time scheduling.Thus if the initial speed estimate using Eq.(3)gives insufficient time accuracy.one can iterate a second time by using the results of the first trial to update the polynomial coefficients.The range of arrival time for the example ill
Time Separation RequirementsThe present ATC system uses radar vectors and speed control to space aircraft so that the minimum separation distance rules arc not violated.The minimum separation distance rules depend on aircraft-weight category, and are summarized in Table I.For example, if a large aircraft lands first and is followed by a small aircraft, these aircraft are to be no closer than 4 n.mi.ap-art for the entire common path length.These minimum separation distances can be converted to minimum separation times using speed profile data.Suppose that a large aircraft and a small aircraft use the same runway.The large aircraft is traveling at 180 knots, and at the outer marker (located 3.11 n.mi.from touchdown) begins its deceleration (at 2 1'1/s") to a final speed of 135 knots.The final speed for the low speed aircraft is 11 () knots, and the common path length is 5.09 n.rni.This information is summarized in Fig. 2. If the large aircraft lands first, the minimum distance separation occurs at the beginning of the common path.Using this information, the minimum separation time at touchdown can be computed to be 138 s.With this separation time, the minimum separation distance  In this study, one was designated arrival control, the other final control.In proximity to the color displays, there was a keyboard with which the ATe display related requests that were entered into the controller displays and the simulation computer.Such inputs included changing theposition of an aircraft identification tag, transferring an aircraft between control sectors, or stopping and restarting the flow of traffic at the feeder fixes.Each keyboard pilot stat ion can control up to ten computergenerated aircraft ximultaucou-Iy.The clearance vocabulary includes standard heading, speed.and altitude clcarancc-.as well as special clearances for 4D equipped aircraft.Jn 1his study, three keyboard stations were used: one was responsible I'or all aircraft in the arrival sector, while the other IWO divided responsibility for aircraft in the final control sector.No piloted simulator was used.I! is planned to include an airline quality simulator in future studies of the mixed environmcur ,
Scenario and Test ConditionsThe simulated terminal area is based on the John f. Kennedy (lFK) International Airport, New York.The route structure and runway configuration investigated are shown in Fig. 3.It is assumed that instrument flight rule (lFR) conditions prevail, and that all aircraft use runway 4R; furthermore, no departures, winds, or navigation errors are simulated.Two routes, Ellis, from the north, and Sates, from the south, are high-altitude routes flown by large or heavy jet transport type aircraft.Aircraft on these routes fly profile descent procedures, but may be either 4-0 equipped or unequipped.Hence, there is a mix of 4-0 equipped and unequipped aircraft of the same speed class along the same route.In addition, low-speed aircraft were considered which flew the Deerpark route from the east, but shared a 5 n.rni.common pat h length and used the same runway as rhe jet traffic.The Dcerpark traffic was unequipped, and always constituted 2S u ,o of the traffic mix.For the purposes of the study, an extended terminal area is considered.Aircraft enter the extended terminal area at the feeder fix departure points, and are at cruise.The total distance to be flown along each of the jet routes is about 120 n.mi.Two air traffic controller positions were established, an arrival control and a final control.The arrival controller handles arrivals from all three feeder fixes and transfers traffic to the final controller at approximately 20 n.rni.from touchdown.Comrol procedures differ for equipped and unequipped aircralt.Controllers were instructed to monitor the progress of 4-D equipped all-craft after the lime i1ssigllfl1ell!ha-.been of the display provides schedule information for all aircraft in the approach control sector.At the top of the table, the time is shown in hours, minutes, and seconds, The first column shows the aircraft identification, such as "RI."The second column provides status (STA) which includes I) weight category: small (S), large (blank), or heavy (H); and 2) 4-D status, equipped (4) or unequipped (U).The third column provides the assigned route (RT).Also shown is the scheduled touchdown time (ETA) at the runway in minutes and seconds.Thus, R I will touch down at 13:37:00, Note thai touch down times are shown for all aircraft, equipped or unequipped.This is the time the equipped aircraft has been assigned by ground control 10 touchdown.No time assignment is given to the unequipped aircraft; rather, the controller is !O use this information and the positions of the 4•D equipped aircraft as they traverse their routes to generate appropriate vectors to the unequipped aircraft so that they touch down at the time indicated.The last column is the delay (DY), where Ihe expected delay at touchdown is in seconds.For purposes of this mitial study, it was assumed that all aircraft depart the feeder fix at their scheduled departure times.This assumes the existence of an advanced en route metering system, In the absence of such a system, large feeder fix departure errors may occur for unequipped aircraft.The issues of what magnitude departure errors can be tolerated as well as the means (0 provide ground computer assists to null departure errors will be the subject of a separate study.However, as the unequipped aircraft traverses its route in the terminal area, it will deviate from its scheduled touchdown time.lt is this deviation thai is shown in the "OY" column, Finally, aircraft below the dolled line are aircraft which will depart the feeder fix within the next 5 min (shown in the furthest right column), indicated by the feeder fix departure timeJn minutes and seconds,The main test variable was the mix of traffic.Three mix cases were run: 25, 50, and 75'% 4-D equipped, In addition, baseline data were obtained for the D,n!) 4-D equipped ease, i.e., when all aircraft are vectored.FOT the case of 50% 4-D equipped, two formats were used for FDT information.The first is the standard display format discussed previously in the second condiriou, and no lime information is displayed in the FIYT for the unequipped aircraft.Unequipped aircraft were The controllers were asked if there was any difficulty in handling the mix of speed cases, the slow traffic on Deerpark and the jet traffic on Ellis and Sates.They indicated that spacing behind the low-speed aircraft was sometimes a problem, since they had to allow for a large initial separation along the common path length.Also, one controller indicated that when handling a slow aircraft, he was reluctant to extend the downwind leg since this would result in a larger common path with the jet traffic.Hence, the airspace was somewhat confining for the slow traffic.No difficulties were indicted in spacing the high-speed equipped aircraft and high-speed unequipped aircraft along the same jet route.The controllers were provided with time scheduling information in the FDT.The table was a time-ordered listing of traffic in each sector.Touchdown limes and expected delays also were provided for each aircraft.The controllers indicated that the only information they used was the time-ordered listing from which the relative order of traffic in the downwind leg and the traffic from Sates were determined.By using this information, and not altering the 4-D equipped aircraft, the controllers were able to vector the unequipped aircraft to their assigned landing slots.However, the touchdown time and delay information were not used.Based on observations, standard vectoring techniques for the unequipped aircraft were adequate to fine-tune the spacing between aircraft.For the conditions of the experiment, there was not much need to alter initial schedules.If considerable interactive schedule manipulation is required, however, then it seems that a separate controller station for flow control and scheduling is needed.There is not sufficient time for the arrival and final controllers to monitor traffic visually and also to monitor numerical time scheduling information at the same time.The use of a flow control position is consistent with both the presentand near-term ATe systems which use flow controller positions for metering traffic.
Controller WorkloadController workload will be measured by the clearances issued, and will be compared as a function of mix condition.Table 3 provides the average number of clearances/aircraft.The average number of heading, speed, and altitude clearances is shown, and the total number of these clearances is also provided.It can be seen that as more aircraft are 4~D equipped, the average number of clcaranccsvaircraft decreases.This is fairly obvious in the experiment context described, since 4-D equipped aircraft were not vectored to as large an extent as possible.The concern is: does the average number of clearances for the unequipped increase as the percentage of equipped traffic increases?The answer to that question is provided in Table 4, which gives the average number of clearances/aircraft for the Deerpark route only.It should be recalled that the Decrpark traffic was always 25'ro of the traffic sample, and thal all Deerpark traffic is unequipped aircraft.The table indicates that the average number of clearances given to the Decrpark unequipped aircraft is the same, independent of the mix condition.Also ,hown is [he average time in the system (in minutes) for the Deerpark traffic, which also is seen to be independent of [he mix condition.Similar results were obtained for Sates and F!li, unequipped traffic.Thus, the total workload reduction as the percentage of 4~D equipped aircraft increases (shown in fable I) was not obtained by additional vectors and delays for the unequipped aircraft., merely listed in departure order beneath the time ordered list of 4-1) aircraft.The aircraft arrival rate into the terminal area was assumed to be high enough so that a full schedule with no gaps is generated.The arrival rate for the baseline model was 30 aircratt/h and varied up to 34 aircrafr/h for the 75 % case.The lower" full schedule" arrival rate for the (}OlO 4-D case IS due to the time separation buffers added for the unequipped aircraft.No departure traffic was simulated, nor were winds or naviaation errors considered.These will be included in future investigations.However, they are Hot expected to alter the general procedures discussed here significantly.In addition to the main test cases, some special runs were conducted to get a minimum amount of data on other issues of interest.Due to the time constraints of real-time test ing, these could not be considered as main variables.These issues included: I) handling of traffic after a breakdown occurs in the 4-0 scheduling computer; 2) rescheduling aircraft if a scheduled conflict occurs; 3) handling deviations from feeder fix departure times; and 4) operating at higher arrival rates for the vectoring mode.Thirtv data runs were made in November 1982, each 80 min IOIHL Three research air traffic controller subjects from the FA;;' Technical Center participated in this study.

Controller EvaluationsQualitative data were obtained from controller verbal evaluations recorded after each data run, and from controller written evaluations obtained after the completion of all data runs.Controllers were asked to compare operations under the traffic mix conditions.The 250;0 equipped case was rated the condition with the heaviest workload.The main difficulty seemed to be that the controllers were establishing distance .,padng of the majority of the traffic.They felt that by not altering the night path of the 4-D equipped aircraft, they were occasionally losing some slot time.They were, however, quite pleased with the 5011'/0 equipped case, which allowed for easy handling of the unequipped aircraft.One controller cornmen ted that it was the best ratio.He could "work without being overtaxed," The 75070 4-D equipped ease was rated most orderly by all the controllers.but when so many aircraft were 4~D equipped (the only unequipped aircraft were the Deerpark arrivals which always constituted 25% of the traffic sample), there was "basically nothing to do."The human factors Figure 5b is the corresponding plot for the 96 flights flown in the 75 u 70 4-1) equipped case.In the latter plot.the only region used for path stretching is the base leg of the Deerpark route.By contrast , the baseline mode requires a large region to perform vector operations.The 4-D operauons permit the aircraft to flv more order I'!, fuel-efficient routes, and 10 reduce 1he airspace required f;~rr each TOme considerably.Special Case Runs 111 addilion to :he main tes! case where the variable was the percentage of 4-D equipped aircraft, a minimum amount of data was mk en (namely 1-2 runs Glch) for a variety e)f other test varia bles.These will now be briefly described.Fifo:-Sa Airspace used, 0•'" 4-1).

toss of 4-1)There was a desire to examine how traffic handlinu is disrupted if a breakdown of the 4-0 scheduling computer should occur.To investigate this, the FDT was removed from the screen during a 75 0 / 0 4-D equipped run so that the controllers IlO longer had a display of schedule times and order for aircraft in their sector.Furthermore.all feeder fix departures from then on had IlO 4-0 time assignment.and would have to be vectored.The map display which showed aircraft positions was not removed.Initially, there was no change.The 4,D equipped aircraft already in the control sector could still be left alone, since they would continue to follow their previously assigned 4-D route.This is in contrast to a totally ground-based 4-D system where the ground ;;yskrn generates clearances for every aircraft.When I hat type of system fails.all aircraft arc affected in a short time.The onlv difficulty experienced wih the system tested was that after tht ailur.. occurred, controller, continued to allow traffic to depart the feeder fixes at the higher arrival rare for the i5/ u ti equipped case, rather than adjust to the baseline vector arrival rate.l tthe flow-rate adjusHnem for new I-ceder-fix departures is made when the failure occurs.then ,t seemdear that the I usc of the onboard 4•[) system provides it safe transition to Ihe standard vector mode.
Uncoordtnated FlowIn the main data runs, it was assumed that all aircraft depart the feeder fix without initial error.However, two special runs were conducted when the Deerpark traffic departed randomly.The Deerpark traffic still constituted 25 11 /0 of the total traffic, but was not coordinated with the Sates and Ellis traffic flows.The mix condition was 50 il / O 4-D equipped, which meant that some of the Ellis and Sates traffic was also unequipped.However, all Ellis and Sates traffic departed the feeder fix with no time errors, as before.Time slots were allocated in the usual fashion for the equipped and for the Sates and Ellis unequipped.For the Deerpark traffic, time slots were allocated based 011 the Deerpark arrival now rate; however, time slots did not correspond to the actual Deerpark departure times.Two display formats for the FDT were used; neither was the standard formal.In the first case, no time or order information was available on the FDT for any unequipped aircraft.In the second case.the Ellis and Sates unequipped traffic was shown with time and order information, while the Deerpark traffic was listed only in departure order.For the first format, the uncoordinated Deerpark flow resulted in heavy workload and reduced capacity.The addition of time and order information for Ellis and Sates in the second format improved both workload and capacity, but the mismatched flow was still a problem.It was felt that some kind of ground computer advisory at the time of departure from Dcerpark would assist in establishing an efficient flow with respect to the time scheduled routes.A separate study is planned which would investigate the following issues: I) what magnitude departure errors can be tolerated without causing a breakdown of the 4~D system; and 2) how to provide ground assists to null departure errors,
Real Time RescheduftnaThis special case briefly evaluated the effect of large feeder fix departure time errors, and the feasibility of having the approach controller correct these errors by rescheduling the equipped aircraft.In the special run, departure times were chosen such that aircraft departing from different feeder fixes would frequently be pairwise in conflict at the runway.These deliberately scheduled pairwise conflicts involved all types of aircraft, equipped, unequipped, large, heavy, and small.The conflicts were created by shifting the originally conflict-free landing times of certain aircraft by one landing time slot.Since the original schedule was full, this created conflicts.At the same time, it opened adjacent time slots which could be used to resolve the conflicts.A 50 11 70 4~D equipped traffic mix was used.As in previous runs, predicted landing times were displayed in the night data table, revealing the identity of aircraft in COil flier as soon as they became active.rile problem for the controller was to deled the predicted conflict on the FDT as soon as an aircraft had departed the feeder fix and to reschedule the landing time of a 4-D equipped aircraft into an adjacent conflict-free time slot.Ihe rescheduling procedure depended on I\\'O special commands, one used by the controller and one used by' the pseudopilot, that exploited the unique capabilities of the 4-D equipped aircraft.Ihe usc of these commands as aids in rescheduling is most easily explained by describing the controller procedure.Assume the controller has selected a 4 D aircraft IUS! departing the feeder fix if} be delayed by some amount of rime, typically min.He first vectors tbe aircraft off the 4~D route at about a 45 deg angle.Then he enrers in his keyboard the command known as Capture Predict (eT) along with the aircraft ID and the number of a capture waypouu on the originala-D route.The 4+D algorithm calculates and displays the predicted landing time on the controller's display.This landing time is the time the aircraft would touch down if it flew directly from its present position to the capture way point and then followed the standard route.Since the landing time is dependent on aircraft position, it is updated every 30 s as long as the 4-D aircraft continues in the vector mode.The predicted landing time will gradually increase as long as the 4•[) aircraft is heading away from the designated capture point.When the predicted lauding time is within a few seconds of the desired rescheduling time, the controller issues lJ1(' Capture Waypoint command to the pseudopilot.This will cause the aircraft to rejoin the 4•D route at the designated waypoint and achieve a landing time close to that predicted on the controller-s display.In general, the procedures described above allowed the controller to perform the rescheduling operation successfully.Since the approach control position had low workload [0 begin with, there was sufficient time to devote to this task , and after a brief learning period, the task became routine.By using the two commands in sequence, the controller was able to insert a 4~D aircraft between two occupied rime slots with high accuracy, rarely missing the target time by more than 10 s.Resolving predicted conflicts outside the final approach area has two well-known advantages.which were confirmed in this experiment.First, 11 is more fuel-efficient to absorb delays at high altitude, and second it reduces the workload of the final controller by reducing the frequency of spacing vectors.The main difficulty with these procedures was that the data display format and the command entry language were nor optimal for this mode of operation.Future research willtrv to improve the human interface for the rescheduling tasks.
Vector Operations and CepacuyIn the vector mode, a time separation buffer of 20 s was assumed to be added [0 the minimum separation time for each pair of landing aircraft.This resulted in a capacity of about 30 aircraft per h.If all aircraft were 4-D equipped and no buffers added, the capacity would be 37 aircraft per h.In two special runs, the separation buffers were dropped to see if vector operations would be feasible at the higher arrival rate.Data from these special runs indicated that it was necessary to delay feeder fix arrivals, and that more airspace was used for vectoring aircraft.It was determined that the landing rate was about the same as it was without the buffers.Thus, the limitation of tile maximum arrival rate via the time buffers was reasonable, otherwise capacity would have to be reduced by the controllers via holding and path stretching delays.Thus, the addition of 4-D equipped aircraft reduces the buffers and increases capacity.
ConclusionsAlgorithms were developed to obtain an initial lime schedule and to provide for revisions for a mix of 4~D equipped and unequipped aircraft in the terminal area.These algorithms were used to develop a candidate SCI of operational procedures for mixing 4-D equipped and unequipped jet aircraft along the same route, and for mixing different speed classes along merging routes, A basic rule established was nor [0 alter the 4••[) equipped aircraft once they were assigned a tanding time.This procedure resulted in the controllers learning 10 usc the 4-D aircraft positions to vector the unequipped aircraft to their assigned landing slot effectively.However procedures were also demonstrated 10 vector the equipped aircraft and to reassign touchdown rimes.In addition, it was shown that a loss of the ground-based 4~D system results in a smooth transition to vector ooerations.]03ritative data actually showed a decrease in the number of controller clearances with respect to the 00::0 4~[) equipped case.Controllers felt that the procedure of not altering the 4~D aircraft when so few were equipped was workable, but a more complex task.The controller workload as measured by the average number of clearances per aircraft decreased as the percentage of 4-D equipped aircraft increased.Moreover, this average decrease was no! accomplished at the expense of the unequipped aircraft.The number of clearances for the unequipped aircraft as well as the time delays were indepcndent of mix condition, Additional studies are required to optimize the operational procedures and to develop procedures to handle aircraft deviations from assigned routes and limes; however, this study established a basic set of algorithms and procedures which are reasonable and effective.or years Nf\SA has designed and flight-tested research systems incorporating various types of tin;e-conlrol methods for both STOL and conventiona!aircraft.These tcsts have demonstrated the ability to predict and control arrival 1'11111:
