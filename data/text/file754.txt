METHODS
Airport and Airspace DesignBoth the 2-runway and 3-runway studies used a common fictitious airport (KSRT) based on the current Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) layout and operations, with the exception of the runways which were set 750 feet apart.The west side of the airport was simulated in its south configuration only (18L and 18R for 2-runways, and 18L, 18C and 18R for 3-runways).Equipage to a CAT-IIIB level was assumed.
Operational ProceduresFlights in the simulation were initiated at about 25 nmi from the airport, with the assumption that they were already placed into aircraft pairs or triples.Approach and departure routes and procedures were similar to those used at DFW.The aircraft flew 4D arrival trajectories and were paired or 'tripled' with aircraft arriving from any of the four meter fixes (NE, NW, SE, SW) located near the edge of the terminal airspace, about 40-60 nmi from the airport.The concept allows for pairing based on aircraft type, performance characteristics and estimated time of arrival.In the study, the pairing was scripted in the traffic scenarios.The aircraft fly 4D trajectories up to a point in the airspace, referred to as the coupling point, designated at 12 nmi from the runway threshold.From the coupling point onwards, the aircraft fly in a formation such that they were coupled for speed.In the 2-runway study, the trailing aircraft precisely maintained temporal spacing of 15 sec with +/-10 sec tolerance for error (a window of 5-25sec), behind the lead aircraft to avoid wake of the lead aircraft (Rossow et al., 2005).The path flown by the trailing aircraft in the 2-runway study involved a slew angle of six degrees to the landing runway.The aircraft became parallel at about two nmi from the runway, as shown in Figure 2. In the 3-runway study, the center aircraft precisely maintained 12 s spacing behind the lead aircraft, and the right aircraft maintained 24 s behind the lead aircraft beyond the coupling point.As shown in Figure 2, the approach paths of the two trailing aircraft were at designated slew angles from the center of the runway -6-deg for the center runway aircraft and 12-deg for the right runway aircraft.All three aircraft turned straight-in for the final approach during the last two nmi from the runway.For both the 2-and 3-runway procedures, onboard automation monitored the paired runway for potential conflicts.Automation also displayed the predicted safe zone from the wake generated by the lead aircraft (and center aircraft for 3runway procedures).Visual and aural alerts were used to alert pilots to the lead (or center) aircraft blunders or the wake of the lead (or center) aircraft drifting towards the aircraft behind it.The navigation displays (Figure 3) depicted the breakout trajectory as a white line, after the aircraft crossed the coupling point.For the 3runways study, the breakout trajectory was shown for both the center and the right aircraft.In both studies, the breakout trajectory was dynamically generated considering wake, traffic, structures, and terrain of airport surroundings.Breakouts were caused by an intentional lead-aircraft blundering towards the following aircraft, or the wake of the lead aircraft drifting towards the following aircraft.Different locations of the breakout on the arrival path required different breakout maneuvers, which change the angle of the escape trajectory on the navigation displays.When the breakout was required at different altitudes on the arrival path, different bank angles for the breakout maneuvers were used and the curvature of the breakout trajectory changed on the navigation displays.The pilots were required to fly the breakout trajectory manually using the flight director when they received an aural and red visual alert.For both the 2-runway and 3-runway studies, the breakout performed above 500 ft altitude required an initial bank angle of 30 deg, and the breakout at an altitude between 200-500 ft required an initial bank angle of 10 deg (Tables 1 and2).The pilots at this stage were instructed to follow the "S" shaped breakout trajectory displayed on the navigation display as accurately as possible (Figure 3).The trajectory was "S" shaped so the final leg of the trajectory became parallel to the runways.The 3-runway study used similar bank angles to those used in the 2-runway study.In addition, the pilot participants flew different headings based on the position in the echelon.The center aircraft (18C) changed its heading to 20-deg and the right aircraft (18R) changed its heading to 40-deg, giving more space to the center aircraft.The aircraft performing the breakout maneuver also climbed to 3000 ft as part of the breakout trajectory.The final leg of the breakout trajectory parallel to the runways was 1.5 nmi abeam for aircraft flying to 18C and 3.0 nmi for aircraft flying to 18R.
Simulation PlatformFor both studies, the human-in-the-loop experiments of breakout maneuvers for paired and triple runways were performed approaches in the Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator (ACFS) located at the NASA Ames Research Center.The ACFS is a motion-based simulator that can be configured to represent current and future cockpits.At the time of this experiment, the simulator had performance characteristics similar to a Boeing 757, but its displays were modified to study advanced flight operational concepts.
ParticipantsThe study participants were recently retired pilots from commercial airlines.All of them were male and all had experience with glass cockpits.Their average pilot experience was about 38 years, and their average number of years since retirement was less than two.
Traffic ScenarioFor the 2-runway study, the traffic scenario involved two aircraft: (1) The ACFS flight simulator as the trailing aircraft (i.e., the ownship) and (2) A scripted Boeing 747-400 as the leading aircraft.For the 3-runway study, the traffic scenario involved three aircraft, where the flight simulator (i.e., the ownship) was either the center or right aircraft.The other two aircraft were scripted.When the ownship was in the center position, the aircraft causing the off-nominal situation was the left-most aircraft.When the ownship was in the right-most position, the aircraft causing the off-nominal maneuver was the center aircraft.The off-nominal event was introduced in the scenarios through lead aircraft intentionally deviating off its trajectory or adverse winds causing its wake to drift towards the following aircraft.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStatistical results on two dependent variables are reported in the analysis of data generated from the experimental runs: (1) Ownship cross track error, collected digitally during the breakout phase of the simulation flight and (2) The pilots' subjective assessments of workload.Data were analyzed using 3-way Factorial Analysis of Variance with three independent variables, with each independent variable having 2 levels: (1) Number of runways (2 vs. 3), (2) Cause of breakout (aircraft deviation and wake) and (3) Location of breakout (high and low altitude).
Cross Track ErrorCross track error, collected by the simulator's digital data collection system, is one measure of trajectory accuracy particularly sensitive to breakout maneuvers.Cross track error was measured by the distance between the actual ownship position and the system-generated breakout trajectory position (i.e., the off-course distance), with both positions shown on the Navigation Display.Hence, less cross track error correlates to higher breakout trajectory conformance.For each simulation run, cross track error was averaged across time from the breakout point to the end of the flight.A statistically significant ANOVA main effect of the number of runways on the ownship's breakout cross track error was found, in comparing the 2-runway and the 3-runway (right ownship) conditions (F=21.92,df=1,15, p<0.001) (Table 3).The directionality of means for this main effect indicates more cross track error under the 3-runway (right ownship) condition as compared to the 2-runway condition.This could be attributed to having 2 aircraft to the left of the ownship during breakout (3-runway, right ownship), creating an increased sense of urgency on the part of the pilot to escape the cause of the off-nominal situation, i.e., the possible additive effect of wake and/or blunder of both aircraft to the left of the ownship might prompt the pilot to overshoot the breakout trajectory further to the right as a safety measure.Some increased cross track error was also observed under the 3-runway (center ownship) condition as compared to the 2-runway condition, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.This lack of statistical significance might reflect the center position of the ownship, which requires that the pilot maintain safe separation with 2 other aircraft -one to the right, and one to the left of the ownship, thereby posing constraints on aircraft movement to either the right or the left, to maintain adequate separation.The pilot-participants pointed out that this prompted them to exercise a larger degree of vigilance in flying the breakout trajectory, which would explain less cross track error, as compared to the 3-runway (right ownship) condition, even though the right ownship is not much safer than the center aircraft.Mean cross track error values generally indicate reasonable levels of accuracy in flying the breakout trajectory.However, maximum values at the end of the distribution for the triple-runway operations (Table 3) might indicate a need for improved training to prevent the occasional overshoot of the breakout trajectory.A statistically significant Number of Runways by Breakout Location (altitude) interaction effect on cross track error was also observed.A larger mean cross track error difference between high and low altitude locations was observed under the 3-runway (right ownship) condition, as compared to the 2-runway condition (F=16.12,df=1,15, p<0.005) (Figure 4).This interaction effect is best understood when one considers that breakout procedures for the higher altitudes are more difficult and that procedures are more complex for the 3-runway operations.As postulated above, the 3-runway centerownship pilot may have exercised special vigilance in flying the breakout trajectory more accurately, due to the aircraft's central location in the triplet echelon, which would account for less cross track error.Since the pilot in the 3-runway (right ownship) condition is mostly concerned about loss of separation with the center aircraft and the possible additive effect of having two aircraft to the left in the breakout formation (wake turbulence and/or track deviation of both aircraft), the pilot may be less concerned about exercising special vigilance in flying the breakout trajectory accurately, but rather, escaping the track deviation or wake turbulence of both aircraft by moving as quickly as possible towards the right, and possibly overshooting the breakout trajectory.Also, since the higher altitude breakout procedures require a more aggressive maneuver (as compared to the lower altitude procedures), the possible tendency for the pilot to overshoot the breakout trajectory further to the right at the higher altitude might reflect a continuation of the already aggressive nature of the required maneuver.
WorkloadParticipants completed the NASA TLX workload questionnaire (Hart and Staveland, 1988) after every run.Data were collected on each of the six TLX workload measures, which were combined to derive a composite workload measure, which ranged from 1 (very low workload) through 7 (very high workload).Table 4 presents statistics on average composite workload, broken down by the number of runways and position of the ownship.Overall, workload can be characterized as moderate.While trends should be viewed with some caution, due to lack of statistical significance, the directionality of means shows increased workload under the 3-runway conditions as compared to the 2-runway condition.This would make sense, due to the increased geometric complexity of the 3-runway procedures and pilots needing to maintain safe separation with 2 other aircraft (as compared to only 1 other aircraft under the 2-runway condition), thereby increasing pilot workload.A statistically significant Number of Runways by Breakout Cause interaction effect was observed, in comparing workload for 2-runways and 3runways (Right Ownship) by Aircraft Deviation and Wake (Figure 5)..43, df=1,15, p<0.005).This effect can be explained by the relative complexity of the 3-runway operations and the unstable nature of wake turbulence from possibly two other aircraft to the left of the ownship.Since having two aircraft to the left of the ownship during breakout (3-runway, right ownship) could create an increased sense of urgency on the part of the pilot to escape the cause of the offnominal situation, i.e., the possible additive effect of wake of both aircraft to the leftFigure 1 :1Figure 1: Echelon formation for triples (shaded area below aircraft shows predicted wake turbulence zone)
