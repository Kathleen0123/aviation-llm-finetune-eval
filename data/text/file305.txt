developing optimized scheduling algorithms, creating the advisories and human computer interfaces for the ground and local controllers, designing and building a high-fidelity, real-time human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation facility to evaluate the effectiveness of the advisories, and conducting simulation studies to validate the use of the advisories in a realistic simulation environment.In today's operations, the ground controller clears the aircraft from a spot as soon as possible by directing it onto a taxiway.The spot denotes a physical location where aircraft are handed off between ramp and ground controllers (outbound) and ground to ramp controllers (inbound).Ground controllers then hand off the aircraft to local control.The local controller then clears the aircraft from the taxiway to a departure queue.Each aircraft moves forward in its queue until it receives a takeoff clearance.During busy periods, the runway queues and taxiways become congested, and aircraft are subjected to stop-and-go operations.The proposed concept of operations (ConOps) for the midterm system (2015-2018) would impose some delays at the spots in busy traffic periods in order to reduce taxiway and runway queue delays, particularly the number of stop-and-go operations.Optimization algorithms for surface planning have been developed that will form the basis of decision support tools for the ground and local controller to achieve more efficient operations during busy traffic periods.The core scheduling algorithms being developed for SARDA for the midterm are the Spot Release Planner (SRP) and the Runway Scheduler (RS).Each scheduler is formulated as a deterministic optimization problem with different objective problems and decision variables.SRP provides the optimum sequence of spot release and approximate release times as output.Essentially, it provides a mechanism for delaying the aircraft at the spot, rather than at departure queues, resulting in less congested surface traffic without sacrificing runway throughput.The RS manages the operations of a single departure runway, scheduling takeoffs as well as runway crossings for arrival aircraft.The scheduler must satisfy constraints such as wake separation criteria, miles-in-trail (MIT) restrictions, and the Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT).SRP and RS introduce a concept and an implementation approach to providing time-based metering on the surface.SRP provides release-time metering advisories for all control points, which are the spots, to the ground controller.RS provides the local controller with two metering locations: the runway departure point and the active runway crossing intersections.Taken together, SRP and RS begin to provide metering advisories on the airport surface for both departures and arrivals.This represents the first attempt at an integrated approach to provide airport-wide improvement in traffic management and hence, efficiency.This sequence and schedule data as generated by SRP and RS need to be displayed in an effective manner to the ground and local controllers so that the quality of the planning information can be evaluated in simulation.An initial simulation was conducted to examine the operator interface.Future evaluations will use these findings to develop candidate decision support tools (DSTs), which can be further evaluated in FAA facilities.Two display options were investigated: a datatag advisory format and a timeline advisory format.The datatag format incorporated the advisory information into the datatag element of each relevant aircraft on the plan-view map displays.The timeline version presented visualization of temporal information in a separate window on the workstation adjacent to the map displays.These display options were compared with a baseline mode in which no advisory information was provided to the controller.In order to provide a sufficiently realistic environment for a controller evaluation of these tools, a major airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), was selected for a simulation evaluation.A real-time HITL simulation evaluation of DFW was conducted in April 2010.Because the primary purpose of the evaluation was to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the proposed surface concept and algorithms, an out-the-window visual format was not used.In addition, the simulation was restricted to the operations on the east side of DFW, in order to keep the number of participants (controller and pseudo-pilots (PPs)) at a manageable level.The two controller subjects, who alternated at the ground and local controller positions, were retired Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) controllers from DFW.The pseudo-pilots had experience as commercial or private pilots, or former air traffic controllers.The April 2010 Simulation consisted of 56 simulation runs, each lasting 45 minutes.In addition to the display variable (timeline, datatag, or baseline) described above, traffic rate was the other key variable; traffic rates were either based on current DFW loads or two heavy rates, both of which represented an increase of 50 percent over today's operation.Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected, and key results are highlighted below.Data collected during the simulation indicate, for departure traffic, a consistent reduction in the average number of stops, from about six stops to three, in heavy traffic when the SRP advisories were used.This was not accomplished at the expense of adding stops for arriving traffic because the data indicate the same average number of stops for arrivals across all test conditions.Reducing the number of stops also impacted the average total departure fuel consumption, which was reduced 45 percent with the use of SARDA.Controllers indicated a preference for the timeline display format compared to the datatag representation.According to self-reports from questionnaires, controllers indicated that the timeline made it easier to plan ahead and kept clutter off the map.They also indicated information updates and sequence changes could be recognized more easily with the timeline display format.Controllers had difficulty adapting to the spot release times because the sequences recommended by SRP were often inconsistent with current practices.In addition, SRP sequence and release time update rate of 40 seconds were disruptive to their planning model.Analyses indicated that the high traffic condition increased perceived workload for ground controllers and local controllers.However, analyses also indicated little impact of SARDA advisories on participants' perceived workload.Ground controllers showed decreased situation awareness when using the SRP advisories.This finding is consistent with controllers' subjective reports that they found the SRP advisories disruptive to planning, which is critical to developing and maintaining situation awareness.Results generally indicate significant promise for SARDA.Future studies are planned that will modify the SARDA display as per controller evaluations, improve the robustness of the algorithms and add uncertainties to the evaluations, and consider the impact of a realistic tower environment, with controller attention split between monitoring displays and observing traffic by looking out the window.These will be evaluated in follow-on real-time HITL simulations and eventually at an FAA field site.To date, the primary focus of the SARDA research involves building a proof-of-concept for implementing metering of ground traffic.The operational concept involves pushing delays from the departure queue back into the spot and ramp area.However, this concept also imposes ramp management congestion and will require complimentary tools to aid ramp controllers.This ramp control research will commence after maturation of the SARDA scheduling technology and ideally in partnership with an air carrier.
INTRODUCTIONThe Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) work represents a key airport surface management activity within the Safe and Efficient Surface Operations (SESO) research focus area.The goal of the SARDA research is to develop a controller advisory tool for increasing the environmental and operational efficiency of surface traffic.Creating such a tool and validating its effectiveness entails developing optimized scheduling algorithms; creating advisories and human computer interfaces to interact with ground and local controllers; designing and building a highfidelity, real-time human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the advisories; and conducting simulation studies to validate advisory usage in a realistic (heavily congested, major airport) environment.This report provides the background on the SESO project, and describes the SARDA concept and tool and how it relates to other ongoing Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) research.The report then discusses the operational concept, provides an overview of the schedulers and the human factors evaluation approach, describes the simulator, and presents the simulation results and findings.The appendices include a detailed description of the real-time high-fidelity HITL surface simulator, controller and pseudo-pilot training materials, and scenario development.SESO research is investigating new technologies and concepts to increase airport capacity by enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of surface operations.The research will result in evaluations of integrated automation technologies and procedures designed to:â€¢ Improve surface traffic planning through: 1) balanced runway usage; 2) optimized taxi planning of departures and arrivals; 3) departure scheduling satisfying environmental constraints, dynamic wake vortex separation criteria, and constraints driven by other NAS domains; and 4) balanced runway usage and efficient runway configuration management through coordination with Super Density Operations (SDO).â€¢ Provide trajectory-based surface operations capabilities by: 1) modeling aircraft surface trajectory prediction and synthesis, 2) developing pilot display requirements and technologies for four-dimensional (4-D) taxi clearance compliance, and 3) developing taxi clearance conformance monitoring algorithms and procedures.â€¢ Maintain safe ground operations through the development of conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) concepts for both airborne and ground-based systems.The SARDA research is part of the "improved surface traffic planning" thread, which is the primary focus of this document.Both in-house researchers and external research partners (through the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) and Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracting vehicles) are performing surface research.NRAs have been awarded to academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and industry to perform foundational research to address technology gaps.The NASA SBIR program provided an opportunity for small, high-technology companies and research institutions to participate in NASA-sponsored research and development efforts in key technology areas.Table 1 identifies the research partners that have contributed to the SESO research.
BACKGROUNDAirports are one of the most important resources in the air transportation system.In many situations, however, airports are a limiting constraint for the rest of the airspace system, adversely affecting both throughput and efficiency of the entire National Airspace System (NAS) (refs. 2,3).Many contributing factors conspire to make airports the bottleneck in the NAS.Notionally, those limiting factors can be divided into two categories: physical and operational.An example of a physical limiting factor is poor visibility due to fog, which routinely enshrouds San Francisco International Airport (SFO) during the summer months.This reduces the airport arrival rate, potentially reducing the airport's capacity to half of a clear-day operation.A closing of an active runway causes a similar reduction in airport capacity.One example of an operationally limiting factor occurs when a departure aircraft has to wait at the front of the departure queue to meet its miles-in-trail (MIT) restriction over a particular departure fix.In a single-queue configuration, the aircraft can block other aircraft in the queue from advancing.In another example, an aircraft that is assigned an Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT) arrives at the front of the queue early but has to wait until the appropriate release window approaches.These sample conditions can impose undue inefficiency in the traffic management workflow.The consequences of operational limiting factors can be as serious as physical factors in terms of operational costs to airlines and environmental impacts.These two types of factors combine to make surface management and airport operations less efficient, and while they do happen on a frequent basis, they are usually managed adequately by current-day procedures and staffing levels.However, with the anticipated increase in traffic demand in the future, current human skill sets and staffing levels may limit efficiency.Therefore, new decision support tools (DSTs) and capabilities will be required to assist tower Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel to smoothly and effectively manage the anticipated growth in traffic.The airport efficiency characteristics can be defined using various types of metrics, such as: increase in airport throughput, increase in runway usage, reduction in delay, reduction in taxi time, reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and reduction in arrival gate conflict and gate holding.The examples also illustrate potential areas of research to increase airport efficiency and alleviate surface congestion.It may be that each factor contributes an incremental change in system efficiency, but taken as a whole, they can significantly increase overall airport efficiency, affecting arrivals and departures as well as surface traffic management.The airport bottleneck problem is a worldwide phenomenon, happening at all major airports around the world, and it has caught the attention of the global research community.Recently, research organizations both in the United States and Europe have been focusing on the issues of inefficient airport surface operations and trying to develop new concepts and procedures, as well as supporting technologies to improve the capacity of the airport system.The runway system has been identified as a key constraint (ref.4), and it has been shown that departure analysis could lead to the identification of control points where the runway operations can be affected.A conceptual design of a departure planner has been developed, composed of functional components based on a queuing model approach (ref.13).Taxi delay reductions compared to a taxi schedule based on the first-come, first-served (FCFS) method were then demonstrated.In addition, efficient runway scheduler algorithms have also been developed with the objective of maximizing the throughput of runway operations while satisfying various constraints (refs. 14,15).Issues of fuel consumption and resulting environmental impacts due to inefficient surface operations have gained more attention in recent years.A comprehensive analysis of fuel consumption and emissions during aircraft taxi operations at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) has been conducted (ref.16).In the analysis, stops (in both taxiways and runway queue) and resulting acceleration events constitute approximately 18 percent of total fuel spent in surface operations.In other words, at least the same amount of fuel can be saved if 'stop-and-go' situations of aircraft on taxiways and runway queues can be eliminated.In an attempt to evaluate new concepts and early technologies in the field, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) evaluated the DST developed based on the concept of the Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM) at Memphis International Airport (ref.17).The objective of the tool is to deliver a strategic surface traffic plan that is relatively easy for the tower controller to execute without significant changes in operational procedures.20), where the trajectories of aircraft are planned and controlled with the aid of automation assistance.However, in these studies there is a gap in optimally addressing the access to the taxiway system itself through spots or gates.Furthermore, system robustness and computational costs during implementation have not been adequately addressed.The current SARDA research seeks to provide ground and local controllers with a concept and implementation approach to provide optimal timebased metering on the airport surface.The SARDA scheduler will provide release-time metering advisories at all control points, which include the spot for the ground controller, and the runway departure point and active runway crossing intersections for the local controller.Essentially, it provides a mechanism for delaying the aircraft at the spot, rather than at departure queues, resulting in less congested surface traffic without sacrificing runway throughput.The scheduler provides metering advisories for both arrivals and departures.This document presents the development, implementation, and testing of a "midterm" concept of optimized airport surface operations developed as part of NASA's surface optimization research, with midterm implying targeted usage beginning around 2015-2018.Designs of the system architecture and individual components to realize the developed concept are presented.Further, based on this concept, a prototype DST is described; the tool could be used by the air traffic control tower (ATCT) controllers to improve efficiency of airport surface operations, as well as to reduce environmental impacts.Results of the real-time, human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation for testing the tool and validating the concept are also presented.
The Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) ResearchThe Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) project was initiated in July 2009 under the direction of the SESO research focus area.The goals of the effort are to develop a concept of operations for a midterm ATCT DST to enable efficient operations, build a HITL surface simulation capability for ATCT controllers, and conduct initial experiments to evaluate performance of the surface optimization algorithms as well as the usability of the tower controller tool.The assembled team put forth a technical strategy and created an experimental plan to test the proof-of-concept.The researchers developed two surface optimization algorithms, the Spot Release Planner (SRP) and the Runway Scheduler (RS).The team's activity was divided into four areas: Concept of Operations (ConOps)/algorithm development, software development, evaluation and testing, and human factors.A high-level outline of the tasks in each area is listed.â€¢ ConOps/algorithm development -Develop a ConOps for a surface traffic management tool for ground and local controllers at a busy airport.-Develop and test scheduling algorithms to generate optimal advisories for departures waiting at the spots and runway departure queues.-Develop requirements for the human-computer user interface with the schedulers.â€¢ Software development -Develop software architecture to support scheduling and user interface modules.-Integrate (plug-in) modules within the Surface Management System (SMS) framework.-Integrate the Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG) and SMS systems.-Develop and implement the user interfaces designed by the human factors researchers.
â€¢ Testing and evaluation-Develop traffic scenarios and data collection test matrix.-Perform system integration and testing.-Develop training materials and conduct training of pseudo-pilots.-Conduct simulation tests.-Perform data recording and archival of simulation runs, traffic scenario, voice communication, and video capture.-Analyze scheduling performance.
â€¢ Human factors-Develop the human-computer interface and graphical user display.-Develop controller classroom training material.-Develop questionnaires for test subjects (e.g., controllers) and pseudo-pilots.-Participate as active observers during test runs and administer questionnaires after each test.-Conducted post-run interviews of controllers.-Analyze human factors data.DFW was modeled for the purposes of conducting simulation experiments.While the entire airport was modeled, all west-side operations were controlled by automation.Our test subjects, retired DFW tower controllers and supervisors, controlled traffic on the east side of DFW.Testing of the SARDA technology occurred in three stages, with each stage phasing in a greater level of fidelity.The first shakedown simulation was conducted at the FutureFlight Central (FFC) facility at Ames Research Center in December 2009 for 5 days, including 2 days of training.The Spot Release Planner (SRP), a ground controller tool that provides optimal sequence and timing for releasing aircraft from the spot, was implemented and tested, but traffic was simulated for only one DFW terminal (Terminal A).In March 2010, the second shakedown simulation was conducted for 5 days with an extended scope that included traffic to all east-side terminals (A, C, and E).In addition to the SRP, the Runway Scheduler (RS) was introduced and tested during this phase.The RS generated an optimal sequence of runway operations (i.e., both takeoffs and runway crossings) for the local controller.Lastly, a data collection simulation was conducted in April 2010 with the same set of configurations as the March simulation, but with modified test scenarios and control procedures.The simulation lasted for 2 weeks.A detailed description of the supporting materials from the April simulation is presented in Appendix G.The objectives of the SARDA research (which address the first SESO research objective, as presented in the Introduction section) are as follows:â€¢ Implement midterm ConOps of a tower controller tool using the SRP and RS.â€¢ Evaluate performance of the integrated system of SRP and RS.â€¢ Develop test procedures for evaluation of the algorithm and its benefits.â€¢ Conduct preliminary human performance and workload evaluations.â€¢ Continue development of the real-time HITL simulation platform to support future surface research objectives.NOTE: In NASA parlance, midterm represents the 2015-2020 time frame.The FAA's implementation and deployment time frame will occur later, due to further system development and hardening for operational deployment.
Relationship With Other Safe and Efficient Surface Operations (SESO) ResearchThe SARDA research has the potential to extend and integrate with other research areas that are being investigated under the SESO project.The list below highlights potential integration research.
Integrated Surface Management With Flight Deck (FD).Extending the SARDA capability to integrate with flight deck (FD) automation tools can assist pilots in complying with taxi clearances.This will require the SARDA tool to integrate with FD technology to assist pilots in meeting the Required Time of Arrival (RTA) at the end of the taxi route (i.e., runway threshold or runway queue entry point).For example, in the absence of datalink between FD and tower, a single RTA for the end of taxi route can be issued to the pilot by the controller via voice communication.The pilot could manually enter at most one RTA in the FD automation tool.With datalink, there is a possibility of automatically relaying multiple RTAs to the FD automation.
Taxi Conformance Monitoring.The SESO project was awarded research through a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) to develop a concept and algorithms for the taxi conformance monitoring function.The taxi conformance monitoring function includes three categories of conformance monitoring:â€¢ Spatial route conformance check.â€¢ RTA conformance monitoring function.â€¢ RTA conformance prediction function.The taxi conformance monitoring function is required for trajectory-based surface operations, where the conformance monitoring function enables the surface traffic scheduler function to provide revised RTAs if aircraft are not conforming to the given RTAs.In particular, a portion of the conformance monitoring function can be integrated with the SARDA tool, such that predefined nonconformance situations can trigger the scheduling function to recalculate the spot release schedule of departure aircraft.In addition, the route conformance checking function can trigger the function that generates an alert for tower controllers when an aircraft enters into a wrong taxiway.
Surface Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R).The surface CD&R research under the SESO project includes both aircraft-and ground-based functions.The objectives of aircraft-based CD&R research are to:â€¢ Develop concept and requirements for CD&R in the terminal maneuvering area for current and emerging NextGen operations.â€¢ Develop and evaluate CD&R algorithms through fast-time simulations.â€¢ Evaluate conflict alert display concepts and alert timing through HITL simulations.â€¢ Expand algorithms to enable accurate CD&R for emerging NextGen operations.In 2010, the SESO research focus area began research on ground-based CD&R functions through the NRA research teams (table 1).The objectives of the ground-based CD&R research are to:â€¢ Formulate ConOps for ground-based CD&R framework.â€¢ Develop performance models of surveillance systems.â€¢ Develop a rule-based framework for short-term conflict detection.â€¢ Develop probabilistic trajectory-prediction-based framework for long-term conflict detection.â€¢ Develop search-based short-term conflict resolution algorithm and long-term conflict resolution procedure.â€¢ Implement CD&R algorithms, and integrate and test with surface traffic simulation.The purpose of surface CD&R is to ensure the safety of surface operations by providing mechanisms to detect conflicts and provide an alert to pilots of the aircraft involved in the conflict situation.The short-term conflict detection function detects conflicts due to loss of separation between aircraft in a very near future (e.g., less than 30 seconds) or entering into a protected area such as an active runway occupied by another aircraft.The long-term conflict detection, on the other hand, detects any conflicts due to nonconformance of the aircraft taxi schedule, which may not necessarily cause an immediate safety risk but may cause strategic conflicts.Both short-and long-term CD&R functions are critical components for the NextGen surface operations.There is a potential for integration of surface CD&R function with the surface DST, such as the SARDA tool, in conjunction with surface scheduling and taxi conformance monitoring.
Relationship With Other Concepts and Technology Development (CTD) ResearchThe SARDA tool has great potential to integrate with DSTs being investigated outside the SESO research.For example, the Precision Departure Release Capability (PDRC) being developed by NASA researchers is a candidate for such integration (ref.22).PDRC provides automated communication between tower ATC and the en route traffic manager, and uses trajectory-based OFF (takeoff) time prediction for en route departure scheduling in Call For Release (CFR) situations.Notionally, PDRC will have better prediction of OFF times because by using the SARDA advisories, controllers can provide a more consistent departure time with less uncertainty.The Terminal Area Precision Scheduling System (TAPSS) concept is being investigated within the Super Density Operations (SDO) research team.The TAPSS tool provides a precision scheduling algorithm and controller advisory for arrival aircraft in the terminal airspace.Terminal operations with assistance from such a precision scheduling tool will contribute to improved prediction of arrival times of aircraft landing on the airport.The SARDA tool will benefit from integration with the terminal DST in developing the surface taxi schedule (ref.23).The SARDA tool also needs to receive relevant traffic information from both terminal and en route ATC.Departure fix closure, and Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) such as miles-in-trail (MIT) restrictions and Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT) are among the needed information.The scheduling algorithms within the SARDA tool need such information in computing an optimal schedule for departure aircraft.
Technology IntegrationAs presented thus far, various research groups (in-house, NRA, and SBIR) are tackling the different aspects of the surface problem.They all help contribute to the goals set forth by the SESO project.An initial goal was for NASA to ease the integration of disparate pieces of research into one coherent platform and technology.NASA selected the Surface Management System (SMS) (ref.24) to conduct the SARDA research leveraging the prior development of SMS.The SMS technology has been transferred to the FAA and was renamed the Surface Decision Support System (SDSS).SDSS and NASA's SMS share practically the same codebase, using some software management branching scheme to allow and reflect the unique requirements of each organization.During the SARDA development, the SMS software was re-architected to provide a plug-in architecture.The use of the modular plug-ins allows NASA researchers the freedom to develop new technologies without impact to the FAA's operational code.Additionally, NASA hopes to transfer the functionally discrete and modular software pieces to the FAA as each piece matures independently.The SARDA team intends to capitalize on the modularity by recommending that the NRA teams deliver their technologies using the modular SMS plug-in format.NASA will integrate, test, validate, and if applicable, incorporate the new technologies into the SMS baseline.
The Human Factors ElementThis document contains a human factors section, which is focused on the tool's impact (workload and situation awareness) on the controllers.More information is presented in the following sections:
SARDA CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS)In today's operations, the ground controller clears the aircraft from a spot as soon as possible by directing it onto a taxiway.The spot denotes a physical location where ramp control makes the handoff to ground control.Ground then hands off the aircraft to local control.The local controller then clears the aircraft from the taxiway to a departure queue.Each aircraft then moves forward in its queue until it receives a takeoff clearance.During busy periods, the runway queues and taxiways become congested, and aircraft are subjected to stop-and-go operations.The proposed SARDA ConOps for the midterm system will impose some delays at the spots in busy periods in order to reduce taxiway and runway queue delays, particularly stop-and-go operations.Put another way, the concept of time-based metering will be introduced to the surface domain.Metering will occur at two locations: metering out of the spot into the active movement area and metering departures at the departure queues.The airport surface domain of interest covers the area where departure and arrival aircraft operate, including ramps, taxiways, and runways.Figure 1 illustrates a generic airport surface layout.Optimization algorithms for surface planning have been developed to aide ground and local controllers by providing efficient operations during busy periods.Table 2 lists the tower controllers, their functions, and the corresponding scheduling support tool.The operations in the ramp area include passenger deplaning/boarding, refueling, food catering services, loading/unloading passenger luggage, etc. Ramp controllers control the pushback of aircraft from the gate when the aircraft are ready for departure.Ramp control may fall under the jurisdiction of the airlines, airport authority, or the FAA.However, the ground and local controllers working in an Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) strictly control aircraft movement on taxiways and runways.When an aircraft reaches the spot (the handoff point between the ramp area and the taxiway system, typically marked on the pavement with a number), the ground controller provides taxi instruction to the pilot and clears the aircraft to taxi into the movement area.The ground controller maneuvers traffic on the surface and delivers departure aircraft to the assigned runways safely and efficiently, and vice versa for arrival aircraft.The responsibility of a local controller is to manage runway operations, including takeoff, landing, and runway crossing.Typically, there is a queue or multiple queue lanes of departure aircraft formed near the runway (at the departure queue), and the local controller determines sequence of takeoff (e.g., first come, first served), and clears aircraft for takeoff based on the rules of wake separation and other separation criteria.The entire sequence of departure runway operations mentioned above involves the following decision factors from the perspective of the tower controller:â€¢ Time to enter the taxiway from the spot.â€¢ Taxi route, along with separation among aircraft on the taxiway and prioritization at intersections.â€¢ Queue area management (a queue area can have more than one lane (fig.1)).In this case, assignment of aircraft to an appropriate queue lane needs to be decided.â€¢ Time for takeoff; clearance times should consider wake separation, Area Navigation (RNAV) procedures, departure fix rate, runway crossing of arrival flights, and other factors.â€¢ Time for active runway crossing.â€¢ Application of Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) to affected aircraft and their interaction with non-TMI aircraft.It should be noted that the use of 'spots' are typically implemented at congested airports where there are no geographic limitations on the placement of spots.Certain airports like SFO do not employ spots in terminals where pushing back from the gate places the aircraft in the active movement area.However, the scheduling algorithm can designate this gate pushback location as a spot to initiate scheduling calculations.The authors would like to point out the differences between the physical designation of the spot and the logical definition used by the scheduler (that of entry into the active movement area).
Shifting of Delay Absorption LocationThe first phase of research investigated the potential deployment of departure metering at spots and runway departure queues using optimization techniques, with the primary users being the tower air traffic controllers.Combined, these two metering points can alleviate ground congestion and minimize fuel burn and environmental impact, such as from taxiway stop-and-go conditions.But there is a cost, as the congestion problem has been transferred from the taxiways and departure queue into the ramp area.Thus, the benefits of this approach must be examined.This ConOps assumes that advanced scheduling information can be made available to the air carriers.The flight operators can take appropriate actions to manage their ground fleet to meet the spot times.While aircraft are being held in the ramp area, air carriers can deploy various means to reduce fuel burn while meeting the spot metering times.If, for example, the airlines know 15-20 minutes in advance that an aircraft is going to be delayed 20 minutes and is sequenced 12th at the spot, ramp controllers can take some fuel-saving options, which may include holding the aircraft at the gate in addition to using ground outlet power, if available.If the gate is not available, then the aircraft may be moved to a holding area, with all engines off.Other similar options may be available to the airlines, but are heavily dependent on airline operational procedures, airport geometry, and terminal layout.Conversely these options are limited once the aircraft enters the active taxiway (or departure queue), and is subject to stop-and-go conditions during congested periods.Showing the feasible implementation of surface metering using optimization techniques represents the first phase of the SARDA research.The second phase, which will be the subject of the follow-on research, will investigate extending the spot-metering concept into the ramp area, possibly to include ramp area management.The SARDA researchers realize that in order for this operational concept to achieve maximum benefits, participation from airline operators will be required.Phase two will take the perspective of the air carrier and will investigate ways to manage aircraft such that they will meet the spot metering times.This phase of research will involve access to some air carrier's data, such as aircraft readiness states, and the carrier's operational procedures.Other factors will include collaboration with the SARDA scheduler and involve some aspect of ground-side or surface collaborative decision making (CDM).This report primarily focuses on the first phase of the SARDA research.The two phases of research complement each other, approaching and providing solutions from two perspectives, ATC and airlines.
Development of Possible Technical Automated Solutions
Automation to Support Multiple Objective ProblemsIn current airport surface operations, most of the above decisions are made 'on-the-fly' by the controllers, and are based on simple rules as well as controller experience.It is possible that with increasing traffic, the decision-making process can be aided with Decision Support Tools (DSTs).Controllers are trained to manage active traffic; with increased traffic, some of the reactive and tactical actions they employ may not offer the 'best' decision for the overall system.Sometimes, the best course of action may prove counterintuitive to the user, but may offer system-wide benefits.Furthermore, there is a need to model the above decision-making process to incorporate and satisfy multiple objective criteria, like reducing delays as well as environmental impacts.There will be a need to provide solutions that can meet multiple objectives and users (terminal and en route controllers), as surface traffic management becomes more complex and tightly integrated with other ATC domains.Past and ongoing research addresses some aspects of the entire decision-making process (refs. 5, 11-15).The purpose of the DST for airport surface operations is to provide scheduling advisories to the controllers and aid in their task of controlling aircraft on the airport surface, while improving efficiency and minimizing negative environmental impact.The surface management DST may provide the following advisories: 1) for the ground controller, the release schedule (e.g., sequence and time) of departure aircraft at the spot, taxi route, and departure runway for each departure aircraft; and 2) for the local controller, the runway queue assignment, takeoff sequence and time, and runway crossing schedule for arrival aircraft.At a basic level, ground controllers currently operate in an opportunistic fashion; for departures that have pushed back and are heading to their assigned spots, controllers clear the aircraft onto a taxiway as soon as possible.In busy times, this may result in congestion on the taxiways and in the departure queue area.Future operations using SARDA will assign a majority of delays to be taken at the spots, thus reducing the number of stop-and-start operations.This, coupled with more efficient departure release/runway crossing planning, will result in improved surface operations.Controllers are trained to control traffic with separation as the primary objective.Factors that can affect their control style may include: airport throughput, flow management plans (i.e., Ground Delay Program (GDP), Ground Stop (GS)), and fairness of service between different airlines.Furthermore, ground and local controllers have not traditionally been tasked with providing overall surface operations that can lead to overall system efficiency.This is where the SARDA concept and tool may supplement their control model, by implementing optimization techniques that take into account multiple objectives, such as reducing the number of stop-and-go conditions, preserving or increasing throughput, and reducing fuel consumption and emissions.
Unified Models and Integrated SolutionsThe technical approach to model the decision process is based on a mathematical framework of optimization.The most optimal solution method would be to consider all the decision factors within the same framework, because there are interdependencies among them.For example, consider the clearance for entering the taxiway from the spot: aircraft bound for an over-subscribed departure fix could be held back at the spot so that taxiways, as well as runway queues, are not crowded.Addressing all the interdependencies in a single framework is a key to a globally optimal solution, and for this reason unified models for a given time horizon have been developed (refs. 12,13).However, dividing the entire problem into parts, solving each part separately, and then integrating these solutions has significant benefits:â€¢ A unified model that solves a larger problem suffers from increased computational times.â€¢ Many optimization models solve the problem over a limited time horizon, with uncertainty being handled through frequent recalculation.Large deviations from the plan would require quick recalculation, which might be easier in integrated solutions, especially when only a sub-problem requires recomputation.Given the relative merits of integrated and unified approaches, the concept presented here is based on an integrated approach.With the high degree of uncertainty in prediction and control of aircraft, frequent recomputation becomes necessary and, hence, integrated approaches perform well.Two sub-problems are identified based on the current-day roles and responsibilities of the Ground Controller (GC) and Local Controller (LC).Some major tasks regarding departures that tower controllers are responsible for include release of aircraft from the ramp area into the taxiway (GC responsibility), and runway operations for both takeoffs and runway crossings (LC responsibility).The scheduling functions designed to address each sub-problem have been named the Spot Release Planner (SRP) and Runway Scheduler (RS).Further, it is possible to combine the two problems into a single scheduler, which would be the unified approach described earlier.This unified scheduler is called the Taxi Scheduler (TS). Figure 2 shows the areas of operations for the surface algorithms (SRP and RS).Detailed descriptions of each scheduler/planner are presented in the following sections.
Proposed Core Scheduling ModelsThe sub-problems that constitute the core scheduling models are: Spot Release Planner (SRP), Runway Scheduler (RS), and Taxi Scheduler (TS).Each scheduler is formulated as a deterministic optimization problem with different objective functions and decision variables.
Spot Release Planner (SRP)The pushback sequence and spot release sequence have been identified as potential control points for departure operations (ref.24).A possible scheme to optimize departure operations is to hold aircraft at the gates and spots and release them "at the right time."The Surface Management System (SMS), a surface decision support tool, currently employs a heuristic to sequence aircraft at the spots (ref.25).Further, the concept of Collaborative Airspace Surface Metering (CASM) has also been introduced and empirically studied to assess the benefits of controlled pushback in efficiency and resulting environmental benefits like reduction in emissions (ref.26).However, in these studies there is a gap in optimally addressing the access to the taxiway system itself through spots or gates.Moreover, the issues of robustness and computational costs during implementation have not been adequately researched.These issues were addressed by developing an SRP (ref.27).An algorithm is proposed for calculating the spot and gate release times for the departure aircraft.Further, a taxi-routing scheme is proposed, which, in conjunction with the above spot/gate metering, avoids unnecessary congestion at the taxiway and departure queues.Delays at spots could potentially be more fuel efficient than delays at taxiways and departure queues.For example, pilots could power down one or more engines at the spot, or with advance knowledge of release times, or airlines could opt to keep the aircraft at the gates (depending on gate availability) using ground power instead of auxiliary power units, thus resulting in further fuel savings.Besides reducing delays, this proposed algorithm reduces the number of stop-and-go situations, reducing the number of "high-thrust" events, and thereby further improving fuel consumption.The objective of SRP is to generate an optimal schedule for aircraft release from the spot that is aimed to achieve maximum runway throughput of the departure flights (i.e., the takeoff time of the last aircraft) in the planning horizon (ref.27).The SRP inputs are:â€¢ Estimated spot arrival times of departing aircraft.â€¢ Assigned spot and runway for each aircraft.This information is used to predict the nominal route to be used by the aircraft.â€¢ Type (or weight class) of each aircraft to be scheduled, along with required wake vortex separation criteria for takeoff for each weight class.â€¢ Other separation criteria, e.g., miles-in-trail (MIT) restrictions applied to aircraft pairs flying over the same departure fix.â€¢ Approximate taxi time for each departing aircraft.â€¢ Any assigned time window of takeoff for departing aircraft (if any), such as Expect Departure Clearance Times (EDCTs) for flights under a Ground Delay Program (GDP), or any other Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) constraints.â€¢ Parameters for running SRP, such as a rolling planning horizon, which could include overlap times and a discounting scheme, if applicable.SRP provides the optimum sequence of spot release and approximate release times as output.SRP operates at two different planning horizons: SRP Long Term (SRP-LT) and SRP Short Term (SRP-ST).The motivations and benefits of these schemes are:â€¢ SRP-LT calculates the optimal spot release schedule for aircraft that are scheduled to push back and reach the spot approximately one hour in the future with a planning horizon of 15 minutes.The larger look-ahead time allows for certain collaborative decision making between ATC and airlines, such as gate pushback and ramp area control in coordination with arriving aircraft.â€¢ SRP-ST works in the immediate time window of up to 15 minutes and accounts for any uncertainty in the airline schedule, ramp operations, etc.The fast running time of the algorithm allows for update (as required) of spot release times based on new estimates of spot arrival times provided either by the tool or direct updates from the airline.The objective and most of the inputs for the two models will be the same.An off-line testing conducted by the team shows average improvement of 8 to 15 percent in overall system performance compared with the results from the system without SRP for a simple case with 20 aircraft in a 15-minute planning horizon.Detailed descriptions of the algorithm and test results are found in reference 27.SRP offers the following benefits:â€¢ It provides a mechanism for delaying the aircraft at the spot rather than at the departure queues, resulting in less congested surface traffic without sacrificing runway throughput.This will reduce the workload of the controllers as well as pilots.In addition, average taxi time can be reduced because aircraft will taxi at slightly higher taxi speeds with less stop-and-go situations.This results in fuel savings and less emissions and noise.â€¢ SRP can provide a tool for potential collaborative decision making on gate pushback for departures with airlines, and with Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and/or Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities for arrival aircraft, such as coordinated touchdown times.However, more research is needed in order to explore the mechanism of collaborative decision-making.â€¢ SRP provides a hypothetical maximum throughput that can be used as an upper bound for other schedulers, resulting in an increase of computational efficiency.Of the two concepts, only the SRP-ST was implemented in the current SARDA simulations.In the December 2009 simulations, the two stages of SRP-ST as described (ref.27) were implemented.The first stage was solved using a mixed integer linear program (MILP), whereas a simple linear program (LP) was used for the second stage.In the March and April 2010 simulations, a modification of the dynamic programming (DP) approach (ref.15) was used for the first stage of SRP, with the second stage remaining the same.The reason for using a different optimizer was to test the compatibility of the SRP algorithm with different optimization engines.
Runway Scheduler (RS)Aircraft departing from an airport face numerous constraints in the scheduling of their departure times.These constraints include wake vortex separation for successive departures, departure fix MIT restrictions, and time window or prioritization constraints for individual flights.Furthermore, departure runway operations also include runway crossings by arrival aircraft needing to cross the departure runway and destined for the terminal gates.Efficient scheduling of departure operations requires scheduling runway crossings and departures simultaneously.Thus, determining runway queues for individual aircraft, and scheduling departures as well as arrival crossings within the same generic framework, would potentially improve efficiency and throughput of overall surface operations at busy airports.RS manages the operations of a single departure runway, scheduling takeoffs as well as runway crossings.The scheduler must satisfy constraints such as wake separation criteria, MIT restrictions, and EDCT.Different optimization problems can be formulated based on the objectives of optimization.A few candidate objectives are:â€¢ Minimize system delay by minimizing total time spent by all aircraft in the queuing area in a given planning horizon.â€¢ Minimize the maximum delay spent by any aircraft in the queue (i.e., a fairness objective).â€¢ Maximize runway throughput by minimizing the departure time of the last aircraft in the departure sequence.The optimal schedules in the preceding three cases need not be the same.Identification of the preferred objective would require trade studies, inputs from the system users (e.g., airlines) and air navigation service providers (e.g., tower controllers), and environmental considerations.Various optimization formulations for RS have been developed using a mixed integer linear program (refs. 14, 28) as well as dynamic programming (ref.15), and performance evaluated for various traffic levels at DFW.The analysis results indicate that system delay was the better objective than throughput or maximum wait time.The RS solves the deterministic problem for a given planning horizon and handles uncertainties during successive runs by employing a rolling planning horizon.The inputs for the RS are:â€¢ Configuration of departure queues (i.e., number of queue lanes and usage).â€¢ Weight class of each departure aircraft.â€¢ Separation criteria for departure aircraft.â€¢ Any constraints on usage of queue.â€¢ Runway queue entry time for each aircraft.â€¢ Intended takeoff times of individual departing aircraft.â€¢ Runway crossing windows (defined in seconds) of arrival aircraft.Consequentially, the RS provides the following outputs:â€¢ Runway queue assignment for each departure aircraft.â€¢ Sequence and timing for takeoffs for each aircraft.â€¢ Sequence and timing of active runway crossing.â€¢ Runway exit assignment for arriving aircraft when applicable.Implementation of the RS as a near-term decision support capability for the local controller may require some changes to the responsibility and workload of the user.For example, RS can provide the local controller with the takeoff and runway crossing sequence advisories.In addition, a runway queue assignment advisory may be added.However, the timing advisory for takeoff and runway crossing operations is not a likely candidate for a near-term or midterm capability due to the uncertainty of calculating taxi operations.Because RS provides an additional decision for each departure aircraft (i.e., which queue to join in cases when multiple queue lanes are available), the communication between the pilots and the controller may be slightly increased.However, the controller is not required to communicate with multiple aircraft at the same time because departures are handled sequentially in nature.Runway queue entry times can be provided by a taxi scheduler (when available) or by a simple trajectory prediction function of the tool based on surface surveillance data.Similarly, runway exit suggestions can also be communicated to the pilot over voice.A mixed integer linear program (MILP) for deterministic runway usage scheduling has been developed (ref.28).The model is generic and can be used for a variety of cases with different methods of handling the queuing area.The MILP explicitly considers separation criteria along with additional constraints and includes an optional prioritization scheme for relevant aircraft.Multiple objectives are used, and simulations indicate substantial benefits over a basic first-come, first-served (FCFS) rule.Computational improvements to the basic MILP are also provided; however, in almost all cases the solution times are large, primarily due to poor bounds (i.e., the optimal solution was found fairly quickly, and a lot of time was spent in proving optimality for this solution by changing the lower bounds).Computational improvement for this MILP is the subject of ongoing research.Given the need for fast computations in the March and April 2010 simulations, the departure queues and runway exits were assigned by the controllers and were taken as input to the algorithm.For this reduced problem, a modification of the dynamic program in reference 15 was used; this model produced computationally acceptable solutions.
Taxi Scheduler (TS)In current airport surface operations, the ground controller is responsible for controlling taxi operations of aircraft (arrivals and departures) between runways and spots or gates.The controller issues taxi clearances to aircraft and makes decisions on aircraft movement.These decisions are then communicated to transient aircraft to make the surface traffic safe and efficient.Although controllers augment their decisions by simple heuristics based on their experience, observations and data analysis of airport surface traffic indicate that a majority of the decisions made by the ground controller on the taxiway are still based on an FCFS rule (ref.29).Researchers have modeled taxi schedulers for surface operations, including ramp, taxi, and runway operations using various optimization methods (refs. 11-13,30).Ideally, the optimization model can provide a complete taxi solution for each aircraft to the users (i.e., pilots and controllers), including routes and timing at each node on the route, which are essentially the 4-D trajectory-based surface operations.Different objectives are being studied with regard to computation time, solution quality, and integration issues.Candidate objectives are to:â€¢ Minimize total taxi time of all aircraft in the system.â€¢ Minimize total time spent by all departures at spots and arrivals at the runway crossing queues.â€¢ Minimize the maximum departure time spent by any aircraft at the spot (for departures) or runway crossing queue (for arrivals).â€¢ Maximize runway throughput by minimizing the departure time of the last aircraft in the runway sequence.It should be noted that using the first objective alone might not be practical because the taxi schedule would generate results using the aircraft's maximum taxi speed, without considerations for throughput or the delay of individual aircraft.The result may impose an unreasonable utilization of airport resources.However, this objective can be used as a linear combination with other objectives.Appropriate choice of the coefficients could be made based on stakeholder inputs, and trade studies will be needed to recommend those coefficients.The inputs for the TS are:â€¢ Type of aircraft and maximum taxi speed on taxiway links.â€¢ Separation criteria at runway (e.g., wake vortex, MIT restrictions).â€¢ Safety constraints on taxiway nodes and links (e.g., no head-on collision, no overtake) .â€¢ Route to be used by aircraft (for a static route problem only).â€¢ Time window of estimated gate pushback or spot arrival times.â€¢ Estimated touchdown time of arrival aircraft.â€¢ A range of travel times for each aircraft on each link from analysis of historical data and/or environmental efficiency.Outputs are:â€¢ Gate pushback times or spot release times.â€¢ Takeoff times of departure aircraft.â€¢ Runway crossing time for arrival aircraft.â€¢ 4-D trajectory for each aircraft.It appears that TS alone can solve for the traffic-scheduling problem covering the entire airport surface.Such a solution offers an equivalent to a combined Spot Release Planner-Runway Scheduler (SRP-RS) system.It is possible that a unified scheme based on TS could be used to provide the same functionality as an integrated SRP-RS system.However, it may not be practical to use it as a sole surface optimizer mainly due to computational performance and current ability to capture uncertainty in the system from initial internal finding.Moreover, certain deviations could be addressed by recalculating only one sub-problem, with little or no change required to the other subproblem.In contrast, the unified approach would have to recalculate for the entire airport.Application of TS as a unified solution was a direction for future research and was not a component of the April 2010 simulations.
Assumptions and RequirementsA framework of any concept is built upon assumptions and requirements.The implementation time frame is an important consideration in developing assumptions and requirements.It frames the solutions based upon estimates of available technologies including surveillance, avionics, and traffic demands.As a reference, in the development of the SARDA concept, the 'near-term' is defined as the time frame with the proposed implementation phase between 2013 and 2015; 'midterm' is defined as between 2015 and 2018; and 'far-term' is defined as the time frame with the proposed implementation phase with considerable automation for the years 2019 to 2025 (ref.31).For the late near-term/early midterm concept described here, the following assumptions are made:â€¢ Airlines or airport authorities manage ramp area operations and, therefore, ATCT does not have direct control of gate pushback of departure aircraft.â€¢ The ground controller has authority to hold departure aircraft at spots within a specified time interval before the aircraft are cleared to move into taxiways.â€¢ Voice communication is still the main mechanism for relaying commands between ATCT controllers and pilots.The technology requirements are as follows:â€¢ Aircraft positional data is available in the ramp area.â€¢ Prediction of pushback times of departure aircraft is possible and available.â€¢ Prediction of arrival times of departure aircraft at runway queue entrance is available.â€¢ Prediction of arrival times of landing aircraft at runway crossing queue is available.â€¢ Execution of algorithms should be fast enough to support real-time decision capabilities.The first and second requirements are to provide accurate predictions of spot arrival times for departure aircraft as inputs to the decision support system.It is assumed that state-of-the-art methodology is used to ensure the accuracy of the prediction capability during the intended deployment time frame.While it may sound desirable to have a surveillance system that provides complete coverage of the ramp area, in many airports such coverage would require significant infrastructure investment to airlines or airport authorities.As an alternative solution, participating airlines or airports can fulfill these requirements by providing the required data (predicted pushback time and consequent spot time) to the decision support system with a data exchange system.Looking further out, one can envision additional requirements to address the far-term concepts, though far-term concepts are not currently being addressed in SARDA research.For completeness, the team has identified additional requirements to address in the far-term concepts:â€¢ Availability of datalink between controller and flight deck.This would be used to provide 4-D trajectories.â€¢ Comprehensive surveillance on the surface including the ramp area.â€¢ A robust framework for conformance monitoring with respect to generated schedules.â€¢ Tools for conflict detection and resolution on the surface.
Example of an Implementation Concept Using the Integrated Approach SchedulerAn SRP model provides sequence and time window of departure releases at spots to the ground controller.Similarly, the RS provides sequence and time window for each takeoff to the local controller.A combined model of SRP and RS will provide advisories to both ground and local controllers.The concept presented here is built upon this combined SRP-RS scheme.In this framework, SRP-ST is used to provide the spot release times for departure aircraft.RS is used to generate takeoff clearances for departures and runway crossing clearances for arrivals.All decisions regarding aircraft movement on taxiways are at the controllers' discretion.The step-by-step walkthrough is presented below:1. Fifteen minutes in advance (to gate pushback or touchdown), the following information for all the arrival and departure aircraft are input into the decision-support system: weight class, departure fix restrictions, EDCTs, ground delay programs, and MIT.Changes in this information may trigger recalculation, and simulations would provide insights on the magnitude of changes, which the system can handle without recalculation.2. Ramp controller or the trajectory prediction module for ramp area movement provides estimated times of arrival (ETAs) of departure aircraft at spots for the next 15 minutes.These ETAs are used by SRP-ST, which provides the controller with the optimal spot release times for that 15minute period.A timeline or a datatag on the map display provides the necessary advisory to the ground controller.3. A rolling planning horizon method is used to handle deviations from spot ETAs, with a predetermined overlap period (say 5 minutes).If a deviation occurs in some aircraft before a planned recalculation, the remaining aircraft are released as before, whenever applicable, until recalculation.4. There is no change in taxi operations from current procedures.5. SRP-ST generated spot release; airport surveillance and trajectory prediction based on FCFS are used to provide ETAs to departure queues for the next 15 minutes.The arrival decision support tool, such as the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) provides estimated touchdown times of arrival flights for the next 15 minutes, which would be inputs to RS.6. RS uses above data to generate runway exit suggestions and crossing times for arrivals, as well as queue assignment and takeoff times for departures.These advisories are provided to the local controller through a list or a datatag on a map display, and are communicated to the flight deck over voice.7. A rolling planning horizon method is also used in RS, with a predetermined overlap period (say 5 minutes).However, if the runway exit suggestion or queue assignment is not met (for example, due to pilot decision), an immediate recalculation for the next 15 minutes is done.
TECHNICAL APPROACH Spot Release Planner (SRP) DetailsThe SARDA concept aims to provide metering advisories to two groups of users, the ground and local controllers, with the Spot Release Planner (SRP) presenting the ground controller with spot release times and sequences.In a complementary fashion, the local controller receives runway departure sequences from the Runway Scheduler (RS).This section provides additional detail about the SRP and RS.The objective of the SRP is to generate an optimal schedule for aircraft release from the spot while aiming to achieve maximum runway throughput for departures (ref.27).SRP calculates for an optimal spot release schedule in two stages.In the first stage, an optimal departure schedule at the runway for a set of incoming flights is generated with an objective of maximizing runway throughput:) max min(i F i t âˆˆ (1)where t i is the calculated takeoff times for flight i, and F denotes all flights.For each flight, an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at its assigned spot, and an estimated taxi time between spot and assigned runway via one of the standard taxi routes, are the main inputs to the algorithm.In addition, constraints, including wake separation criteria and other time/distance constraints, such as a MIT restriction over a common departure fix and Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT) due to a Ground Delay Program (GDP), are applied.The optimization problem of this first stage can be formulated either as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) or by using dynamic programming (DP).Both formulations were evaluated, but the DP was the preferred approach mainly due to its availability over commercial optimization solvers.The second stage of the SRP is to determine optimal times to release aircraft from assigned spots to meet departure schedules.Depending on the complexity of the taxiway geometry and the decision whether to incorporate variable taxi speeds or arrival traffic, the problem can be formulated as either a reduced MILP or a linear program (LP).For surface traffic at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), all of three standard departure taxi routes (i.e., K-EF, K-EG, L-EH shown in figure 3) have a very simple structure with almost equal taxiway lengths.Therefore, spot release times for each aircraft can be calculated simply by subtracting the estimated taxi time from its scheduled takeoff time.i i i t T Ï„ - = (2)where T i is the spot release time and is the estimated taxi time of the i th flight.An additional constraint due to uncertainties of operation is to have a small number of aircraft in the departure queue (e.g., runway queue size < 6) to ensure that there are no gaps in the actual departure schedule.Key design parameters considered for the SRP algorithm are:â€¢ Planning horizon-the future planning time interval for the algorithm.â€¢ Freeze sequence-number of aircraft for which the spot release sequence is fixed across consecutive calls of the algorithm (e.g., first three aircraft in the sequence).â€¢ Equity-a parameter to be used to prevent a particular aircraft or type of aircraft from being penalized in subsequent optimization cycles.â€¢ Priority aircraft-specifies priority in takeoff sequence (e.g., an aircraft in an emergency situation).â€¢ Maximum spot delay or spot queue size-a parameter to be used by the algorithm to prevent a queue from forming at a certain spot.â€¢ Runway queue size-a parameter that specifies the number of aircraft allowed in the runway queue at any time.â€¢ Airport operating points-Airport Departure Rate (ADR) that will affect the optimization of departure schedule.Executing the algorithm periodically to generate new optimization solutions mitigates uncertainties in taxi speed, pilot responses to controller taxi clearances, and interaction among taxiing aircraft.In the simulation, the SRP algorithm was executed every 40 seconds with a rolling planning horizon of 15 minutes.
Runway Scheduler (RS) DetailsThe motivation for and design of the RS were based on an evaluation of the role of the local controller.The local controller strives for efficient runway operations by sequencing takeoffs, considering various factors such as aircraft weight class, departure route, departure fix constraints, Area Navigation (RNAV) procedures, and others.The local controller is also responsible for managing crossing operations of arrival aircraft.With multiple runway queue lanes and multiple crossing points at DFW as shown in figure 3, the sequence decision made by the human controller may be far from optimal due to complexity.A previous study at DFW showed that the average stopped time of aircraft in crossing queues during busy traffic times was over 2 minutes, which turned out to be the most significant contribution to the taxi delay of arrival aircraft (ref.16).Therefore, the objective of the RS is to provide an optimal sequence for takeoffs and runway crossings of arrival aircraft.Previous optimization approaches were developed and tested for various configurations of runway queue structure (refs. 5,12,17).Rathinam et al. (ref. 15) developed a generalized dynamic programming formulation and successfully solved the departure-scheduling problem of a single runway with multiple queue lanes.Optimal solutions to schedule 40 aircraft for an hour were obtained in less than 1/10th of second of computational time.For SARDA, this algorithm was extended to include constraints for runway crossings.In order to incorporate runway crossing constraints, the algorithm requires estimated arrival times of aircraft at hold lines for crossing, as well as travel times for crossing at different speeds.The requirement for estimated crossing times and travel times necessitate a trajectory prediction function, which should include the capability to predict the runway exit an aircraft would use.In order to make the problem simple, runway exits were assigned by the local controller before aircraft landed on the runway.The algorithm also allows multiple crossings at the same time.The inputs to the RS algorithm include ETAs of departure aircraft at their assigned queue lanes (i.e., EF, EG, or EH as shown in figure 3), aircraft type, and wake vortex separation criteria.Similar to current DFW procedures, the ground controller issues a taxi route clearance that includes the departure queue lane assignment.Therefore, the algorithm receives the queue lane information from the controller (via keyboard input).Other constraints such as Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) departure route, EDCT, and RNAV, were not incorporated into the algorithm at the time of simulation.They will be addressed in future study.The dynamic program used the Pareto-optimal solution of both throughput and departure delay; throughput and departure delay are defined below in expressions ( 3) and ( 4) respectively:ïƒ¥ âˆˆ - F i i i t ) ( min Î± (3) ) min(max i t (4)where t i is the calculated takeoff time and Î± i is the earliest release time for flight i (iâˆˆF).Similar to the SRP algorithm, key design parameters to consider for the RS were identified as follows:â€¢ Planning horizon-the future planning time interval for the algorithm (e.g., 15 minutes).â€¢ Maximum departure delay and maximum arrival crossing delay-parameters to be used to prevent a particular aircraft or type of aircraft from being penalized in subsequent optimization cycles.â€¢ Priority aircraft-specifies priority in takeoff/crossing sequence.â€¢ Crossing queue size-specifies the maximum number of aircraft allowed in each crossing queue.â€¢ Maximum simultaneous crossings-specifies the number of crossings allowed simultaneously from a single crossing queue.â€¢ Similar to the SRP, the RS needs to be executed frequently to generate new solutions in order to accommodate uncertainties.In the simulation, the RS algorithm was executed every 40 seconds with a rolling planning horizon of 15 minutes.Note: the update cycle of the RS and SRP does not need to be synchronized.In fact, the updates were offset by 20 seconds, so as to not cause potential network congestion.
HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION EVALUATION
BackgroundThis section focuses on the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation activities that used retired ground and local controller participants to help evaluate some of the SARDA features.Details on user interface design, training, and tool evaluation tools are presented here.The utility of an automated system can be evaluated in terms of the performance of a human user when paired with that system to perform realistic tasks, which may in turn be influenced by a number of factors, including the ease with which that system can be used as well as the users' desire and willingness to use the system."Ease of use" refers to more than simple "buttonology" and training.System usability can be defined by a cluster of factors, including the system's contribution to task efficiency, the frequency with which the user makes errors, the ease with which users can recover from errors, and the satisfaction the operator has when using the system (ref.32).To the extent that a given system lacks usability in any of these critical parameters, the user's performance with that system can be degraded (ref.33).Well-designed tools that perform cognitively difficult tasks for a human can reduce the user's workload associated with performing tasks such as information acquisition and analysis (ref.34).A tool that is poorly designed, however, can add to task complexity, increasing workload beyond manageable levels and reducing the operators' task performance (refs. 35,36).Furthermore, well-designed automated systems can enhance an operator's situation awareness (SA)-their mental model of the current state of the operational environment (ref.37).However, automation can reduce SA such that the human operator has a diminished ability to detect automation failures and to understand the state of the system sufficiently to take over operations manually when needed (ref.37).Users of automation sometimes struggle with understanding what the automation is doing or why it is taking/suggesting a certain action.Significant errors can occur when an operator struggles to ensure congruence between what they think the automation is doing and what they want it to do (ref.38).Decision support automation can interact with information evaluation processes in such a way as to diminish an operator's capacity to make a decision without the automation, which can lead to increased errors when the automated system is wrong or when the automation is deactivated (ref.39).Outcome measures of user/system performance can provide indications of the usefulness of the systems in helping users be more effective and efficient, performing their tasks more accurately and more quickly.Taken together with assessment of users' workload, SA, and usability, these performance measures can paint a rich picture of a system's overall utility.Although this simulation was not intended to evaluate field-ready technology, it provided controllers with exposure to the SARDA tools and served as a venue for them to give early feedback on the effectiveness of the technology.This feedback can have a direct impact on system research and development activities.
General MethodologyThe SARDA evaluation ran from April 22-May 7, 2010.The first 2 days of the evaluation focused on controller and pseudo-pilot familiarization with the simulation environment and controller familiarization with the SARDA tools.The testing phase of the evaluation lasted 10 days.Each testing day comprised six 45-minute scenarios, each of which was followed by a battery of questionnaires.On the afternoon of the last day of the evaluation, controller participants engaged in a structured group workshop to discuss their impressions of, and provide feedback about, the SARDA systems and the evaluation procedures.
Study ParticipantsTwo recently retired air traffic controllers participated in the study.Both participants had over 25 years of air traffic control experience, each with over 20 years of experience working in the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) control tower.Both participants had retired from DFW within 3 years prior to study participation.Neither participant was familiar with the SARDA concepts or tools prior to the study.
Research TeamTwo human factors specialists and one retired air traffic control tower (ATCT) controller, all familiar with the SARDA concept and tools, conducted participant training and served as observers during the study.In addition to training, observers' responsibilities included real-time observation of participants interacting with the SARDA tools, administering questionnaires, and conducting an endof-study debrief with participants.
Training MaterialController
QuestionnairesFollowing each data collection run, three brief questionnaires were issued to the controller participants, and one questionnaire was issued to the pseudo-pilot participants.At the end of the experiment, controller participants were also asked a series of evaluative questions about the SARDA concept and tools, as well as about the simulation as a whole.Each of these questionnaires is described in more detail below.Appendix H: Human Factors Questionnaires contains the sample questionnaires.
Controller post-run questionnairesWorkload.Workload measures were developed to assess the type and degree of perceived mental demands associated with using the SARDA advisories.Perceived workload was measured using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scale (ref.40).The NASA TLX is a multi-dimensional scale of workload that can provide both a global measure of workload, as well as a measure of workload along each of the subscales, which include mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration.The NASA TLX, a widely used scale for assessing workload, has demonstrated sensitivity at low levels of workload, and is relatively easy to understand and use.A global workload score can be determined from an average of ratings on the various subscales.After each run, the controllers were asked to fill out the workload questionnaire via a laptop computer.The controllers answered the questions by indicating their selection on a non-numbered horizontal scale.The scale ranged from low (left anchor) to high (right anchor).During analysis, the scaled was converted to fit between the values of zero (low) and one (high).The human factors findings are presented in the Results and Findings section.In addition, the list of questions presented to the controllers is contained in Appendix H: Human Factors Questionnaires.During the training phase of the study, the controller participants completed a worksheet designed to assess the relative importance of each of the TLX subscales to performance of real-world ATC tasks.The results of this assessment were used to weight each of the subscales in computing a global subjective workload score.To compute an overall workload rating, the inverse of the rating for the performance subscale was used to align the valence of all subscales.On this global workload scale, lower scores indicate lower perceived workload.System users completed this scale after each of 54 data collection runs in the evaluation.Situation Awareness (SA).Situation awareness may be assessed in a variety of ways.Each type of SA measure has strengths and weaknesses and may provide different sorts of information.For example, subjective SA measures, such as the Mission Awareness Rating Scale (MARS) (ref.41) have an advantage of assessing an individual's personal level of SA, are easily administered, and are relatively unobtrusive to collect.However, individuals may not know what information they are unaware of and their judgments may be influenced by self-assessments of their own performance.Similarly, direct objective SA measures, such as the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) (ref.42), have the advantage of providing more objective and less biased estimates of SA, but are relatively obtrusive and require considerable prior analyses to develop valid measurement protocols.Given that different SA measurement approaches may provide different types of information or be more acceptable in certain situations, a measurement strategy using multiple SA approaches is desirable.In this study, both subjective SA and objective SA measures were collected.Subjective SA.The subjective SA instrument used in this study was a modified version of MARS, which consists of two subscales.One subscale assesses SA content and the other assesses SA workload.Each subscale consists of four questions that address the three levels of SAidentification, comprehension, and prediction (ref.42).In addition, a fourth question deals with how well task goals can be identified.The four Workload Subscale questions require the respondent to indicate how much mental effort was required to identify, comprehend, predict, and decide in the given run.All questions were rated on a four-point scale.Overall subjective SA was computed by averaging across all eight items in the questionnaire.Lower scores indicate lower SA.Controller subjective SA ratings were divided by 4, for the purposes of comparison with controller objective SA ratingsObjective SA The objective SA instrument used in this study was developed using a modified version of SAGAT.Prior to the study, a series of objectively verifiable queries related to ground and local controllers' tasks and objectives were generated by human factors specialists and vetted by an ATC subject matter expert.Typically, using SAGAT, these queries would be administered during planned interruptions in task performance.However, because of limitations in the system interactions between Surface Management System (SMS) and Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG), it was not feasible to pause the simulation during a run.Therefore, the objective SA queries were administered immediately upon completion of each run, and query responses were based on what was happening in the simulation at the moment the run ended.This modified procedure limited the assessment of level 3 SA (i.e., prediction, see ref. 42), because of difficulties with objectively verifying statements about controllers' plans once the run was over.Observers from the research team took digital photographs of the ground and local controllers' displays at the end of each run.These photographs were used to assess the "ground truth" answers for the SA queries against which participant responses were compared.The objective SA questionnaire for ground control comprised five queries, and the questionnaire for local control comprised eight queries.All responses were scored as either correct (1) or incorrect (0).Scoring criteria for each item are described in Appendix H: Human Factors Questionnaires.Global objective SA assessments were calculated by averaging scores across all queries for that position.
Pseudo-pilot post-run questionnaireWorkload.The successful movement of traffic in an airport environment is critically dependent on efficient interactions between controllers and pilots.Because the primary focus of the study was on controller performance, it was important to measure pseudo-pilot workload to assess potential impacts on overall system performance.Pseudo-pilots completed the NASA TLX to assess their workload associated with each run.Because pseudo-piloting differs in potentially important ways from piloting real aircraft, pseudo-pilots were not administered the subscale weighting assessment.All subscales were equally weighted in computing a global workload score for each data collection run.Pseudo-pilot ratings were divided by 7 for the purposes of comparison with controller workload ratings.The ratings were analyzed for a total of 36 data collection runs.Additionally, pseudo-pilots were asked to estimate the percent that each of the following factors contributed to their total workload during each run:â€¢ Number of aircraft under their control.â€¢ Size of the area under their control.â€¢ Communications with ATC.â€¢ Executing ATC commands.â€¢ Issues with the screen/map display.Insights based on these assessments may be used in the design and allocation of pseudo-pilot responsibilities for future studies.
Post-run questionnaire and debriefAfter the completion of all data collection runs, controller participants were verbally asked a series of open-ended questions about the SARDA concept and advisories, the verisimilitude of the simulation environment, and the quality of the provided training.Participants' responses were recorded using a digital voice recorder, and were later processed and distilled by members of the research team.Participants' qualitative responses to these questions can provide insights about controllers' behaviors during the simulation, as well as areas of focus for future research and development.
Display OptionsThis section discusses the user display options that were investigated.The section titled SARDA Concept of Operations describes the ConOps and is helpful in understanding how the displays would be used.An important design concern in presenting operators with automated advisories is determining an optimal method for displaying the advice.Considerations may include the time criticality of the information, other information the operator may be integrating into the decision the advisory is supporting (which may influence where the operator is attending when the advice is presented), or concurrent tasks the operator may be performing.To explore potential display tradeoffs, two versions of each SARDA advisory were presented to controller participants during the simulation.A "datatag" version incorporated the advisory into the datatag of relevant aircraft on the map displays.A "timeline" version presented the advisories in a separate window on the workstation adjacent to the map displays.Each of these display options is addressed in more detail below.
Ground Controller Displays-Presenting Spot Release Planner (SRP) AdvisoryDatatag Advisory.In advisory and baseline conditions (Datatag and Timeline, see Test Conditions and Matrix), datatag of aircraft awaiting spot release includes aircraft identification (ID), aircraft type, departure fix, and spot number.With advisories enabled, a spot release sequence number and a spot release countdown timer, both generated by the SRP, were added to the datatag as shown in figure 4. The sequence number indicated the computed optimized order in which controllers should release aircraft from the spot, and the countdown timer showed a time window for spot release (e.g., AAL9094 is first in the spot release sequence, releasing from spot 9, with 4 seconds left in the current release window).Controllers were instructed to release aircraft from the spot in the order indicated by the sequence number when the countdown timer was between 0-60 seconds.When the release time was greater than 60 seconds, the countdown time was displayed on a blue background.Between 0 and 60 seconds, the countdown time was displayed on a flashing green background.After 0 seconds, the timer counted up in negative numbers, and the background turned yellow.When the countdown timer was greater than 300 seconds, or sequence number was greater than 20, the advisory information was not displayed in order to reduce display clutter.Similar to the datatag information and color scheme, aircraft information was presented in blue text if the advisory indicated a spot release time greater than 60 seconds from the current time.Aircraft information turned green if the advisory indicated a spot release time within 60 seconds of the current time.If an aircraft passed the current time without being released from the spot, the aircraft information turned yellow.If the controller took no action within a given duration, the system would recalculate and reassign the aircraft a new release time.Slewing and clicking on an aircraft's data field would highlight that aircraft's information in a green box on both the timeline and the map display.Controllers were instructed to release aircraft from the spot in the sequence represented on the timeline (i.e., from bottom to top), and to try to taxi aircraft into the movement area between 60 and 0 seconds of the advised spot release time on the timeline (when the aircraft information turned green).In the datatag advisory mode, the datatag for aircraft in the Runway 17R departure queue also included a sequence number generated by the RS, displayed in white text in figure 6.The local controllers were instructed to depart traffic in the order given by the sequence number.The RS also assigned sequences to arrivals awaiting crossing of Runway 17R heading toward the terminals.If an arrival had a sequence number of '1,' that aircraft should be instructed by the local controller to cross Runway 17R prior to clearing the next departure, which would have a sequence number of '2.' Multiple arrivals might be given the same sequence number by the RS, indicating that the group of aircraft should cross the runway together.Unlike the SRP advisory, the RS advisory does not provide timing information to the controller, because the local controller does not use that type of information and it clutters the display.
Timeline (Sequence List) Advisory.The RS Timeline advisory condition provided a sequence list format that interleaved departure with arrival runway crossing advisories in a single column (fig.7).Similar to the ground controller's timeline, the sequence list showed a vertical column of aircraft with the first aircraft to be cleared at the bottom of the column.Figure 7 shows departures in green text, displaying aircraft ID and type, departure fix, and RS-generated release sequence number (e.g., DAL121, aircraft type MD82, departing through the SOLDO fix, has a control sequence of one).Arrival aircraft were presented in white text, showing aircraft ID, arrival runway exit, and RSgenerated sequence number (e.g., DAL7209, expected to take the M6 runway exit, and third in the sequence, along with AAL144).Initially, the local controller's timeline display format mirrored that of the ground controller.After vetting the design through subject matter experts, they found the RS-generated sequence to be useful, but the temporal component posed some adverse side effects.They felt that the temporal component introduced more workload (time pressure) to meet the departure time.In contrast, the controllers would not maneuver any aircraft if doing so would negatively affect safety, regardless of any suggested time.Hence, the temporal component was removed, which then transformed the timeline format into a sequence list format.Controllers are quite efficient in spacing aircraft between subsequent departures and arrivals; the sequence list aids in deciding which aircraft to depart next while allowing the controller flexibility to manage other ground traffic.
TEST CONDITIONS AND MATRIX Test Variables and MatrixThe April 2010 test simulated traffic on both the east and west sides of the airport, but only had SRP and RS providing advisories to the participant controllers working the east side of DFW.West-side traffic was controlled by automation.Independent variables included traffic level, controller position, and type of advisory used, as shown in table 3.The traffic level was rated either Normal (No) or High (Hi), with normal representing current-day traffic (airport rate of 89 aircraft/hour) and high representing about 50 percent more traffic (134 aircraft/hour).Each controller worked one of two east tower positions, east ground or east local.After each data collection run, they rotated to the other position.Lastly, controllers were asked to control traffic using one of the four control conditions during each run: Baseline-1 (B1, no advisories-controllers used their experience); Baseline-2 (B2, similar to B1 but used only during heavy traffic); Advisory enabled using Datatag (AD) format; and Advisories enabled using Timeline (AT) format.The B2 runs are highlighted in table 4 in Days 6-9.In B2, controllers were asked to meter departures from the spot without the aid of automation, and maintain no more than six aircraft in the departure queue.Their task required them to manually mimic the objective function of the SRP and RS schedulers; the B1 condition did not ask controllers to mimic the objectives of the automation.The test matrix presented in table 4 shows the mix of test variables deployed during each run.For example, on the first run on Day 1 (G-No1-AD), controller 1 worked the Ground (G) position and controller 2 worked the Local (L), working the normal traffic condition using scenario 1 (Normal-1) with SARDA presenting advisories on the aircraft's datatag (AD).In the next run (L-No1-AT), the controllers switched the position (i.e., controller 1 at Local, controller 2 at Ground), running the same No1 scenario, with SARDA advisories shown on the Timeline display (AT).G-No1-AD G-Hi2-AD L-No1-B1 L-Hi2-B1 G-Hi1-AT L-No1-AT L-Hi2-AT G-No1-AT G-Hi2-AT L-Hi1-B1 G-Hi1-B1 G-No2-B1 L-Hi1-AD L-No2-AD G-No1-AD L-Hi2-AD L-No1-AD G-Hi2-B1 G-No1-B1 L-No2-AT G-No2-AT G-Hi1-AT L-No2-AT L-Hi1-AT G-Hi2-B1 L-No2-B1 L-Hi1-B1 G-No2-AD G-Hi1-AD L-Hi2-ADL-Hi1-B2 L-No1-B1 G-Hi2-AT * L-Hi2-B2 L-Hi2-B1 G-Hi1-B2 G-No1-AT L-Hi1-AD G-Hi2-B2 G-Hi2-AD L-No2-AD G-Hi1-B2 G-No1-B1 L-Hi1-AT Exploratory Runs G-No2-B1 L-Hi1-B2 L-No1-AT G-Hi1-B1 Exploratory Runs L-Hi2-AT G-No2-AD G-Hi2-B2 L-No1-AD Exploratory Runs G-Hi1-AD L-No2-B1 L-Hi2-B2 G-No2-ATL/G -Local/Ground position No/Hi -Normal/High traffic level AT/AD -Advisory Timeline/Advisory Datatag format B1/B2 -Baseline 1/Baseline 2 * Run had corrupted data, hence data set was not analyzed 1 The authors would like to note an erratum in reference 31 where it stated that the last two runs on Day 10 of Table 4 (L-Hi2-B1 and G-Hi2-AD) were conducted to retest the conditions on Day 2-Run 1, and Day 4-Run 1.The Day 10 runs complete the data collection matrix.
Scenario DevelopmentTwo traffic load conditions, normal and heavy, were used during the data collection period.The team developed two similarly loaded scenarios for each traffic load condition, resulting in four distinct traffic scenarios.The scenario file describes the level of traffic for arrivals and departures to be inserted throughout the 45-minute simulation duration.The Normal traffic condition delivered 40 departures and 40 arrivals, while the heavy scenario inserted 64 departures and 60 arrivals.Note that the traffic count covered traffic for both sides of the airport; west-side departures used runways 13R and 18L, and east-side departures used runway 17R.Arrivals landed on the west using runways 13R and 18R while east-side arrivals landed on runways 17C and 17L.More details on scenario generation are available in Appendix F: Historical Input Files for Scenario Generation.It is important that the development of the simulated traffic reflect actual day operations, at least for the Normal (N1 and N2) traffic conditions.As discussed in Appendix E: Scenario Development, the team used recorded track data and the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool (ref.43)  The Matlab tool takes as input the set of heuristics described above, as well as the following five parameters to generate the simulated scenarios.For each scenario, the user can specify the number of departures, the number of arrivals, departure loading profile, arrival loading profile, and duration of simulation time.The departure and arrival loading profile is used to specify the "bunching" of aircraft demand within a certain time window of the simulation run.For example, the researcher may want to insert two arrival pushes or bank within the 45-minute-long session.And in that session, the researcher may want the first arrival bank to happen 15 minutes after start of simulation, and the other to occur 35 minutes after start time.The Matlab-generated traffic scenario profile will include two 'humps,' one at 15 minutes and the other at 35 minutes.The file will also use the SODAA-generated heuristics to proportionally allocate the appropriate aircraft types using particular runways, spot, and gate usage.It will also proportionally allocate the mix of airlines to particular terminals.Similarly, the researcher can define the departure demand profile and Matlab tool (using SODAAgenerated heuristics) to generate the correspondent departure mix of traffic.Taken together, the arrival and departure profiles define the traffic scenario.Furthermore, for each traffic condition (e.g., Normal 1) six identical files were generated, but the call signs of individual aircraft were changed (e.g., replaced AAL1234 with AAL5631) to minimize controller familiarization with repetitive traffic scenarios.
RESULTS AND FINDINGSResults from the 2 weeks of data collection for the DFW tower simulation (April 2010) are presented in this section.System performance metrics such as the number of stops, delays, fuel consumption, and emissions are presented.Human factors metrics include workload, situation awareness, and usability.
Summary of Scenarios and Total AircraftThe 56 simulation data runs used for analysis were conducted with one of two possible controller configurations.A configuration defines all runs staffed by the same participant at a particular position (ground or local).For example, table 5 shows Controller 1 working all runs at the ground position and is referred to as "Controller Configuration 1," while table 6 shows Controller 1 working all traffic while at the local position (Controller Configuration 2).Obviously, as Controller 1 is working ground, Controller 2 is working the complementary position.Tables 5 and6 summarize these runs, with each run being one out of four traffic scenarios.See Test Conditions and Matrix for more details.It should be noted that the Baseline 2 advisory was tested only on the heavy scenarios.Further, the data for the second timeline run for the Heavy 2 scenario on Day 8, Run 1, was corrupted.Hence, throughout this section the fields for that particular run are left empty.Along with the traffic level and advisory configuration, tables 5 and 6 also describe the total aircraft in each simulation run, and their split into arrivals and departures.The number of "complete" arrivals and departures are also listed, denoting the aircraft that used the runways and terminals on the east side, and whose trajectory was completed within the simulation time.Thus, complete arrivals are the ones that landed on either runways 17L or 17C and got to their gates within simulation time.Similarly, complete departures are the aircraft that pushed back and took off from runway 17R within simulation time.The sum of the "Total Complete Departure" and "Total Complete Arrivals" equals "Total Complete Aircraft."For the rest of this section, all analysis is conducted on such complete aircraft trajectories alone.
HighlightsThe number of complete arrivals and departures indicates no change in throughput between the advisory and non-advisory runs.
Number of StopsThis section details the total departure and arrival stops, including ramp area, taxiway, and departure queue.Note that only the aircraft departing from runway 17R are considered, and out of those, only the aircraft with "complete" trajectories were considered.Tables 7 and8 summarize the average stop-and-go situations for the two controller configurations, for all traffic level and advisory conditions.In both the Heavy 1 and Heavy 2 scenarios, there is a decrease in the total number of departure stops with the use of the advisory, both timeline and datatag.The "simulated" advisory, tagged as Baseline 2 (B2) also shows a decrease in total stop-and-go situations, almost the same as the timeline and datatag case.The decrease is non-trivial, with an average reduction of about three stops.However, there is little change in number of stop-and-go situations in the Normal 1 and Normal 2 scenario in the Baseline 1 (B1) and advisory cases (Datatag-D and Timeline-T).A potential reason could be lower traffic in the normal scenarios; lower traffic density would probably result in fewer stop-andgo-inducing congested situations, with little scope for improvement through advisories.In the advisory runs for the heavy scenario, there is a small increase in the number of departure stops in the ramp area.However, there is little change in the number of stops for the normal scenarios between the baseline and advisory cases.Note that the simulation design did not include any tool for effectively managing the ramp area; the advisories were provided only to the ground controller and local controller for spot release and departure runway usage, respectively.With the use of SRP in the absence of ramp management, it is possible that the number of stops could have increased drastically with the use of advisory.Tables 7 and8 also show the departure stops on the taxiways for the different simulation runs of the four scenarios.Taxiway here implies the part of the aircraft trajectory from spot release to the entry into the queue area.As is evident from the tables, analysis indicates that in all cases, 97 percent or more aircraft had no stops on the taxiways.One possible reason is the exclusion of the bridge traffic from the analysis; given the grid-like geometry of DFW's taxiways, there are only a few nodes where potential conflicts can arise due to merging traffic streams, and the nodes where traffic from the west side of DFW merges with the east side is one such possibility.In this analysis, stops for aircraft from the west side are not included.Further, with the emphasis on operations for the eastside terminals, it is possible that controllers resolved conflicts at such merge points by prioritizing east-side aircraft, and thus most of the taxiway stops were in the west-side aircraft that are not accounted for here.The reduction of stop situations on the taxiways and departure queues was one of the motivations for the algorithms implemented in the experiment, and hence it is important to analyze the number of stops and total time stopped in the departure queue.Tables 7 and8 also show the average departure queue stops in each scenario for the different runs with various advisory settings.There is a consistent reduction in the number of stops in the departure queue for the two heavy scenarios, with an average reduction of about 50 percent (from 5.8 stops in baseline 1 to 1.8 in advisory).However, the use of the advisory results in almost no change in the departure queue stops for the two normal scenarios.With the use of the RS on the departure runway and the SRP on spots, it becomes necessary to analyze the stops for the arrivals, primarily for two reasons: 1) with the emphasis on reducing stops for departures, it is possible that controllers might be prioritizing departures over arrivals for the usage of the taxiways close to spots (this would be reflected in increased stops for the arrival aircraft in the advisory cases); and 2) with the use of RS, it is possible that the scheduler might be prioritizing departures over arrivals in scheduling runway usage (this would be indicated in the increase in number of stops for arrivals before crossing with the use of the advisory).As can be seen in tables 7 and 8 ("Avg Arr Taxiway Stops"), there is very little variation in the number of stops for the arrivals between the baseline and advisory case.Note that the results include only the stops before crossing runway 17R, and on the taxiway area before entering the spots.A fraction of the aircraft landed on runway 17L and had to cross runway 17C before coming to runway 17R, and the stops before crossing runway 17C are not included here for consistent comparison between all aircraft.This result, coupled with the little variation in number of stops before crossing runway 17R and on the taxiway, shows that the advisories had almost no effect on the number of stop-and-go situations for arrival aircraft.
HighlightsIn the heavy scenario, the use of advisories results in an average decrease in total departure stops by three stops per departure.The advisory has little effect on departure stops in the normal scenario.The advisory has little effect on arrival stops in both heavy and normal scenarios.As compared to baseline 1, the use of advisories reduces the number of departure queue stops in the heavy scenario.The average number of departure stops in baseline 1 was 5.8, whereas in datatag and timeline runs it was 1.8.
DelaysThis section presents the delay in all the scenarios.As in evaluating the number of stop situations, delay was considered only for the aircraft with complete trajectories.Delay is defined as the difference between actual taxi time minus unimpeded taxi time (in seconds).Unimpeded taxi times were obtained in advance from simulated data using the Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG) tool (ref.44).Total delay is evaluated, as well as the split of the delay (in ramp, taxiway, and runway queue for departures; crossing and taxiway for arrivals) is evaluated.Further, movement area (defined as the taxiway and the runway queue) delay is also evaluated.Tables 9 and10 show the average delay for departures and arrivals for the two controller configurations.These tables also show the split of the delay in the various zones ("Percentage in Ramp," "Percentage in Taxi," and "Percentage in Queue" for departures; "Percentage in Taxi" and "Percentage in 17R crossing" for arrivals).As expected, delay is more in the heavy scenarios as compared to the normal scenarios.There is no consistent change in delay between the baseline and advisory case for both arrivals and departures.However, even though the advisory and baseline runs have the same average departure delay, there is a consistent trend for a larger fraction of delay in the ramp area with the use of advisories.This results in a 66 percent average reduction in movement area departure delay as compared to baseline 1.
HighlightsAverage movement area delay reduced by 66 percent in heavy scenarios with the use of advisories.Advisories have little effect on arrival stops in both heavy and normal scenarios.
Fuel ConsumptionThis section presents the total fuel consumption in all the scenarios.As in evaluating the number of stop situations, the fuel consumption was considered only for the aircraft with complete trajectories.The method used for calculating fuel consumption is detailed in reference 16.Tables 11 and12 present the average total fuel consumption for both arrivals and departures, along with the split into pertinent operations.The fuel consumption for arrivals in ramp operations was not considered because the movement of the arrivals in the ramp area was an automated process.There is not much difference in the total fuel consumption for both arrivals and departures in the advisory and non-advisory case.The fuel consumption in departures is definitely higher in the heavier scenarios.The results show that in the heavier scenarios, the use of advisories shifts the fuel consumption from the departure queue to the ramp area.The SARDA simulation did not incorporate the SRP-LT concept and a ramp control mechanism, which could potentially reduce the fuel consumption in heavy scenarios by about 45 percent ("Percentage in Ramp" under heavy scenarios).Further, there is a 37.7 percent average decrease in the departure movement area fuel consumption in the heavy scenarios.
HighlightsSARDA advisories result in a 37.7 percent decrease in departure movement area fuel consumption compared to baseline 1.Average total departure fuel consumption could have been reduced by 45 percent with the use of SARDA concept, if SRP-LT and ramp control had been used.The SARDA concept has no measured effect on arrival fuel consumption in the movement area.
EmissionsThis section presents the total emissions in all the scenarios.As in evaluating the number of stop situations, emissions were considered only for the aircraft with complete trajectories.The methodology is described in reference 16.Three types of emissions are evaluated: hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO x ).Tables 13 and14 show the average hydrocarbon emissions for all the scenarios for controller configurations 1 and 2, respectively.The emissions have been divided into arrivals and departures, and the split (in ramp, taxiway, and queue for departures; taxiway and crossings for arrivals) is also given.Similarly, tables 15 and 16 give the carbon monoxide emissions, while tables 17 and 18 give the nitrogen oxide emissions.The emissions are lower in the normal scenarios than the heavy scenarios, which are expected because aircraft spend more time on the surface in the heavy scenario and have higher fuel consumption, leading to more emissions.As in fuel consumption, there is a consistent trend for decrease in movement area emissions, with an average decrease of 38.8 percent in hydrocarbon emissions, 38.9 percent decrease in carbon monoxide emissions, and 37.8 percent decrease in nitrogen oxides.Again, the use of advisories has little effect on the arrival emissions in the movement area.
Highlights38.8 percent decrease in movement area departure hydrocarbon emissions.38.9 percent decrease in movement area departure carbon monoxide emissions.37.8 percent decrease in movement area departure nitrogen oxide emissions.The SARDA concept has no measured effect on arrival emissions in the movement area.
Human Factors ResultsThe findings on controller workload, objective and subjective situation awareness, and usability of the SARDA concept based on two variables (traffic load and advisory usage) are presented in this section.It should be noted that the results were gathered from just two test subjects, which may limit the generalization of the findings.Quantitative results were obtained from the post-run questionnaires administered to the controller participants and pseudo-pilots.These results, the statistical tests performed, and their inferences are summarized in tables 19-22, and figures 8 and 9.Controller workload, subjective SA, and objective SA for ground and local controller positions were examined through separate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests.For each position, a total of six ANOVAs were performed-3 (advisory modes) x 2 (traffic levels)-using three repeated measures.The advisory modes consisted of Baseline-1 (B1), Datatag, and Timeline, and the traffic levels were normal and high.In addition, three separate, repeated measures ANOVA tests examined four levels of advisories (B1, Datatag, Timeline, and B2) with results from the high-traffic condition only.Furthermore, the B1 condition was used as a baseline, against which a pair-wise comparison was made (i.e., B1 vs. Datatag, B1 vs. Timeline, B1 vs. B2).The results from the human factors analysis of the SARDA concept are presented in figures 8-10.Pseudo-pilot (PP) workload was analyzed using a 3 (advisory modes: Baseline, Datatag, and Timeline) x 2 (traffic level: normal and high) repeated ANOVA tests.Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationships among the performance metrics of workload, subjective SA, and objective SA.Analyses revealed a negative correlation between workload and subjective SA (r = -0.777,n = 95, p < 0.001), a positive correlation between subjective SA and objective SA (r = 0.298, n = 95, p = 0.003), and no significant correlation between workload and objective SA (r = -0.176,n = 95, p = 0.089).This analysis highlights the potential interdependencies among subjective self-assessment measures-in this case, perceived workload and perceived situational awareness.Individuals may be more likely to rate their situational awareness as low in instances when they perceive their workload as high.This analysis also provides support for including an objective measure of SA, which may reveal aspects of SA unbiased by perceived workload.Means highlighted in bold text are statistically different from baseline based on planned comparisons using p<.05.The workload scale ranges between 0.0 (low) and 1.0 (high).
WorkloadResults revealed that the high-traffic level increased self-reported perceived workload for both ground and local controllers, as anticipated.Compared to Baseline-1 in figure 8, the introduction of SARDA advisories imposed little impact on participants' self-reported perceived workload.
Ground ControllerAlthough one might expect the advisories to alleviate controllers' workload by offloading responsibility for spot release and runway usage decisions, the advisory conditions differed from the baseline in ways that may have counteracted this potential benefit.For example, the advisories' goal (metering traffic to the departure queue from the spot) differed from the historical objective of the ground controllers, which is to minimize aircraft wait time on the ramp.In post-study interviews, controllers indicated some disharmony between the SRP advice and their nominal operations, potentially contributing to an increase in perceived workload.To better understand the difference in controller expectations and goals between the Baseline-1 and advisory conditions, a fourth advisory condition (Baseline-2, B2) was introduced where ground controllers were asked to meter traffic from the spot without SRP advisories.These results, shown in table 23, revealed that ground controllers perceived this task to be more demanding than the baseline condition (workload rating increased from 0.45 to 0.67, with 0.0 being low workload and 1.0 being high workload).This increase in perceived workload appeared to be offset when the SRP advisories were included.Controllers echoed this finding during the post-study interview, indicating that if they were given the task of metering traffic from the ramp area, they would prefer to have an advisory tool like the SRP.Although this notion of metering departures from the spot is not currently integrated into ground control standard operating procedures, many major airports occasionally employ gate-hold procedures that share important features with the spot-metering concept.Application of the SRP algorithms to current-day gate-hold procedures is a potential avenue for further study.Observations of the initial shakedown runs showed (under normal traffic condition) little change to the queue size, with or without the use of advisories.This indicated that the traffic level was not adequate for the controllers to accomplish manual spot metering.The high-traffic scenario provided enough demand, thus allowing them opportunities to exercise manual spot metering (Baseline-2 conditions).Hence B2 runs were made with only high-traffic scenarios.
Local ControllerChanges in perceived workload ratings between Baseline-1 and advisory conditions were not statistically significant for local controllers (fig.8).Like the ground controller, the result showed no significant interaction between the use of advisories and traffic level.The pair-wise comparison between B1 and B2 under high-traffic load in table 23, showed a statistically significant decrease in perceived workload (from 0.6 to 0.4).It is likely the ground controllers, who experienced higher perceived workload in this condition, were highly effective in metering traffic to the departure queue, and thus reduced the local controllers' task load.Like the ground position, there is no significant interaction between the use of advisories and traffic level.
Subjective Situation AwarenessThe results show that the main effect on subjective situation awareness (SA) is traffic level (fig.9).Local and ground controllers reported a decrease in subjective SA in the high-traffic condition.
Ground ControllerPlanned pair-wise comparisons indicate that ground controllers showed a consistent pattern of decreased situation awareness when using the SRP advisories, compared to Baseline-1.This finding is consistent with controllers' comments in post-study interviews.Controllers stated that it was challenging to integrate checking the advisory with their natural flow/scan of the map, making it difficult to get into a rhythm.Controllers also reported that the advisory updating function, which could potentially change the spot release sequence and timing, was very disruptive to their own mental planning process, which is critical to developing and maintaining situation awareness.The interaction between the use of advisories and traffic level on subjective SA was not statistically significant.
Local ControllerSA was not impacted by the RS advisories for the local controllers.This finding is also consistent with controllers' post-study feedback where they indicated that the schedules provided by the RS were frequently consistent with their own plan.It is, perhaps, not surprising that controllers would find the SRP advisories to be less consistent with their own plans than the RS advisories.First, the goal of the SRP advisories is not consistent with ground controllers' present method of operation, whereas there is much greater alignment between the goals of the RS and the local controller.Second, the number of possible solutions that the SRP could generate was much greater than the number of possible solutions generated by the RS, which considered a more constrained problem space.The likelihood that the SRP will propose a plan inconsistent with the ground controller's plan is greater; therefore, updates to the SRP advisories are more likely to result in changes that disrupt the controller's planning.The interaction between advisory and traffic level on subjective SA is not statistically significant for the local controller.
Objective Situation Awareness
Ground ControllerThe objective SA results for the ground position, shown in figure 10, showed no statistically significant effects of traffic level or advisory type.The interaction between advisory and traffic level for objective SA is statistically significant, however.The objective situation awareness decreased at the high-traffic level, but not in the normal traffic.
Local ControllerThe local controllers' results showed no main effects or interactions for objective situation awareness.
UsabilityNo differences emerged in controller metrics between the datatag and timeline advisories; however, there was a consistent numerical trend for higher workload and lower SA when ground controllers used the datatag advisory.This trend is consistent with controllers' post-study feedback, where they expressed a preference for the timeline over the datatag format on the ground control position.Controllers indicated that the timeline advisory made it easier to plan ahead and kept clutter off the map, and they felt like they recognized updates and sequence changes more quickly.Controllers also reported difficulty locating the next-in-sequence aircraft on the map when using the datatag format.The controllers noticed some artifact in the simulator that may affect workload and SA.Factors included: limited route selection (use of Full (EF), Inner (EG), and Outer (EH) taxi routes), little use of bridge traffic (east-west airport terminal crossings), and uniform taxiing speed.These artifacts made the traffic movement appear less realistic.Some of these artifacts, like applying nonuniform taxiing speed, will be addressed in the next series of simulations.
HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP LESSONS LEARNED AND LIMITATIONSThis section presents the human factors lessons learned and shows some of the limitations of the simulation environment for both controllers and pseudo-pilots.
Human Factors Lessons LearnedThe following are lessons learned about controller-system interactions based on the comments from post-study interviews with the controller participants:â€¢ At the ground position, controllers reported preferring to use the timeline advisories over the datatag advisories.They indicated that it was difficult to locate which aircraft was next in sequence using the datatag advisory, particularly during a heavy traffic scenario, because this required a detailed search of the map display.The timeline display, because it included the spot information for each aircraft, made it easy to locate the next aircraft in the spot release sequence.Controllers commented that the datatag advisory contributed to clutter on the scopes, which was eliminated with the timeline advisory.At the local position, there was no reported preference between the timeline and datatag advisories.â€¢ Updates to the sequence order in the SRP that affect the top three or four aircraft were reported as very disruptive to planning.â€¢ Sequences recommended by the SRP were found to be frequently inconsistent with the controllers' natural flow or scan, making it difficult to establish a "rhythm" while using the advisories.â€¢ The controllers in this experiment commented that the advisories took away a lot of their planning.While this impression likely contributed to the reduction in reported workload, the fact that planning was one of the tasks allocated to the automation also likely contributed to the observed reduction in situational awareness.A challenge for future development will be to provide support to the controllers such that self-reported workload is reduced (or remains constant under increasingly complex conditions) while maintaining or enhancing situational awareness.Concepts related to integrating with, rather than replacing, controllers' planning activities should be explored.â€¢ The timeline display provided a "look-ahead" feature, which controllers reported viewing positively, as it gave a sense of how much traffic to expect in the near future.â€¢ Comments indicated that controllers found it was difficult to adjust to using spot release times that were not based on how long an aircraft has been waiting at the spot.They indicated that in their experience, the pilots of waiting aircraft would be calling the controllers and complaining if forced to wait so long in the real world, or if they saw another aircraft released ahead of them that had been waiting less time.This suggests that an important key to successful implementation of the SARDA tools would be educating the airlines, as well as the controllers, about how the tools prioritize spot release to mitigate possible complaints and/or nonconformance by pilots.â€¢ Metering from the spot concept must also ensure that the ramp area does not get congested, which can negatively affect both outbound and inbound traffic flow.â€¢ Controllers indicated that if they were given the task of metering traffic, they would prefer to have the timeline SRP advisor rather than to meter the traffic without an advisor.Although the metering goal in the baseline condition results indicated that controllers were able to successfully operate without an advisor, controllers appreciated that the advisor alleviated some of the workload and pressure associated with that goal.â€¢ Several potential changes to the simulation environment were suggested that could enhance the fidelity (and, thus, the generalizability) of the simulation, including:-Add realistic simulation of ramp congestion.-Include occasional gate changes for arrival aircraft.-Pseudo-pilots should occasionally make requests (e.g., for the full-length route if the aircraft is a heavy so they can have longer runway)-Vary the taxi speeds of aircraft -Allow use of Mike taxiway (to offload departure congestions on the Lima taxiway), and Papa taxiways (allowing the use of the perimeter taxiway for runway 17L arrivals, but also to allow simultaneous crossings of runway 17C, for aircraft destined at different terminals).
Simulator LimitationsThe simulation environment in the study differed from "real world" operations at DFW in several ways.No "out-the-window" view.Controller participants used computer-generated (plan-view) map displays to observe traffic for depictions of the ground and local controller displays used in the simulation.SARDA tools were integrated with these displays.A potential concern for field implementation of any visual-display-based automation is attention/gaze management (i.e., appropriate "heads-up" versus "heads-down" time).Because the SARDA simulation did not employ a "heads-up" out-the-window view, this potential concern was not addressed in the current study.Flight strips were not used.Information normally obtained from flight data strips (e.g., initial departure fix) was displayed as part of the data block associated with each aircraft.However, controller participants reported that, in real-world operations, they also used flight data strips to identify departure sequence as well as serving as memory aids for the status of a given aircraft (e.g., whether an aircraft has been cleared for takeoff).Additionally, given the dynamic updating feature of the SARDA advisories, it is unclear how the advisories might be integrated in a paper flight strip environment.Because flight strips were not included in the current simulation, issues associated with integration of the SARDA advisories into a paper or electronic flight strip environment were not explored.Taxiway and runway limitations.The algorithms used in the SARDA tools were programmed with various constraints on how taxiways and runways would be used.These constraints facilitated the predictive capabilities of the algorithms necessary for future planning.Participants were informed of these constraints, and were asked not to use the runways and taxiways outside of those constraints (e.g., participants were instructed not to depart aircraft on Runway 17C).Field implementation of these algorithms will require a greater level of flexibility to account for off-nominal or unplanned events.Keyboard/mouse data-entry procedures for departures.In order for the SARDA algorithms to predict future aircraft positions, controllers were required to inform the system of critical taxi commands (e.g., assigned departure taxi routes).Because these commands were issued via voice commands to the pseudo-pilots, controllers were also required to make keyboard/mouse data entries to inform the system about the commands just issued to the aircraft, which created an additional procedural step for controllers.Errors in data entry created inaccuracies in system predictions that were manually corrected in real time during the simulation by members of the research team.Error types and frequencies were not analyzed.Pseudo-pilots had a restricted range of actions they could take.Controllers were informed during training about limitations imposed on the pseudo-pilots during the simulation.For example, the pseudo-pilot interface did not permit go-arounds, therefore one strategy for mitigating potential operational errors was not available to controllers.Operational errors (e.g., loss of separation events) were not analyzed.Highly static/predictable traffic flow.Controller participants commented during the post-experiment debrief that the traffic flow was much more predictable in the simulation than in the real world.For example, all aircraft in the simulation taxied at the same speed and did not deviate from assigned routes.The weather conditions remained unchanged and were not introduced as factors in the simulation.It is unclear the extent to which controllers' behavior may have been influenced by the increased predictability of traffic flow.
FUTURE RESEARCHThe findings documented in this report describe a surface automation proof-of-concept that completed the first round of human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing, providing NASA researchers with an initial view into this complex domain.The HITL results pose more research questions, and thus offer opportunities for future research and implementation techniques to improve the current model as well as inspiring the next iteration of the tool.Five key areas that should be addressed are:Incorporation of the arrival traffic into the Spot Release Planner (SRP) concept.The current implementation of the SRP does not explicitly include arrival aircraft in its algorithm.Incorporating arrival aircraft in the strategic planning phase will allow for providing tighter time windows for spot release times, and can lead to less uncertainty in the resulting system.Moreover the controller would be required to simply release the aircraft at the resulting spot times, instead of planning for the slot among a stream of arrivals from which to release the aircraft.Ramp area congestion reduction.Implementation and testing of the SRP Long Term (SRP-LT) concept will address congestion issues in the ramp area by providing the airlines with expected time of release from the spot, thus allowing the aircraft to remain at the gate.A "gate management" algorithm may be required to assign gates to aircraft and efficiently manage the gate holding policy.Improvements to robustness due to uncertainties in the system.This research area will focus on ways to introduce factors such as delay in controller/pilot response time, variation in aircraft taxi speed, and errors in aircraft trajectory prediction or surveillance systems, to systemically add uncertainty into the system and thus demand robustness in the scheduling algorithms.Advanced algorithms for aircraft trajectory prediction will reduce uncertainties, whereas alternate rolling planning horizon schemes could provide more robust and stable solutions.Enhancements to user interference.Inputs collected from the controllers can help further the development of the user interface, to transform the system into a decision support tool (DST), by providing "control knobs."These control knobs can allow the user to change various system parameters such that the system will work in concert with the Air Traffic Management (ATM) plan set forth by the air traffic managers.This will also involve modifying the algorithms to incorporate these additional constraints.In addition, improvements to the user interface to enhance usability of the tool should be pursued.Alternative user interfaces (i.e., to the electronic flight strip) should be investigated to improve user interaction and potentially improve situational awareness, such as using a touch-screen interface.Scheduler enhancements.Enhancements will include exploring the practical methods of using the unified approach (taxi scheduler) mentioned in the SARDA Concept of Operations.The taxi scheduler could solve a traffic-scheduling problem that would cover the entire airport surface.The merit of such a scheduler is the ability to include both arrivals and departures in the optimization model, simultaneously optimize all departure and arrival runways, and the ability to design optimal 4-D trajectories for all aircraft.The current DFW study shows the potential of the surface management tool to aid ground and local controllers with managing aircraft in the active movement area.The five future enhancements stated above are necessary to fortify the tool and transform it into a decision support tool.But in order to reach that point, a series of subsequent tests are needed to investigate incremental improvements along the way.If the goal is to provide full airport management and efficiency, it will require the collaboration of the ramp controller and the corresponding ramp management tool, which is also another area needing research.
The Test Engineer RoomThe Test Engineer Room housed the core SARDA simulation software.From here, the researchers monitored the health status of the system, recorded simulation data, and broadcasted public announcements to the simulation participants.The core software is comprised of two major software systems, the Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG) 2 and the Surface Management System (SMS) 3 .Within the ATG, the subsystems were comprised of the Ground Manager (GM), Super Ground Pilot Station (Super GPS), and the Air Traffic Message Translation Engine (ATMTE).The GM controls the ATG simulation environment while the Super Ground Pilot Station (GPS) acts as an automated pilot under the guidance of event-driven scripted commands.The ATMTE's task is to translate communication messages between ATG and the SMS Cap Server interface (fig.A2).Subsystems used by SMS include the Communications Manager (CM), CM User Interface (CMUI), Model, Client Graphical User Interface (GUI), and the CapServer(fig.A3).The CM acts as the central communications hub of the system, collecting data from external sources, and distributing data to other SMS components.The CMUI provides the user interface for the CM and allows the user to display or modify component connection status.The Model provides aircraft modeling capability within SMS.The CapServer (Collaborative Arrival Planner) 4 provides a communication interface with external programs such as ATG.The simulation engineer occupied the Test Engineer room.The simulation engineer's responsibilities included bringing up all simulation components at start time and monitoring them during the run to ensure system integrity.This person also initiated and terminated all data recordings from both the ATG and SMS systems.Other logistics tasks included archiving simulation log files from the ATG and SMS systems after each run for later analysis, defining the layout of the Controller/Pilot Room, and setting each workstation's configuration.The simulation engineer made announcements over the public address system to inform controllers, pilots, and researchers about simulation run start and end times.The simulation engineer also used software to automatically record the controller's and pilot's radio communications, and organized, collated, and archived the data for each run for post-run analysis.Preparatory duties included the configuration of the communication units situated at each controller, pseudo-pilot, and researcher stations.Figure A4 illustrates the layout of the Test Engineer Room and the Controller/Pilot Room.Included in the figure are the ATG and SMS systems and how they are connected to the respective users, be they controllers or pseudo-pilots (PP).The orange solid line represents the ATG system, while the blue dashed line shows the SMS connection.The left side of the room contained three SMS stations.The ground and local controller each had an SMS workstation configured for their domain of control.The third station was a spare used during visitor demonstrations.The stations ran the SMS GUI clients, which connected to the SMS core processes running in the Test Engineer Room.Seated next to the ground and local controllers during each simulation run were the human factors observers who noted controller comments on the simulation system, scheduling advisories, traffic management preferences, and suggestions for simulation improvement.An additional researcher (moving between controller and pilot partitions) monitored the Controller/Pilot Room to provide technical support, such as systems startup/shutdown for each run, and to quickly convey messages to researchers located in the pseudo-pilot partition of the room.Three pseudo-pilots controlled departing aircraft (denoted as PP1, PP2, and PP5), and three controlled arriving aircraft (denoted as PP3, PP4, and PP6).Departures typically started their taxi from the ramp area, moving into the spots and to their departure runways.A spot represents a location where a hand-off of control is made from the tower to the ramp controllers.Arrivals were typically created a few miles upstream of the runway threshold, where they would land, cross the active runway (17R), and taxi to the arrival spots.Supplementing the pseudo-pilots were automated (computer-controlled) pilots.The automated pilots were typically used to control traffic at ancillary portions of the airport surface or for tasks that were not of main interest to the study.For example, aircraft entering the system 10 miles away from the airport, aircraft assigned to any taxiway heading toward the west side of the airport, or arrivals landing on the far east runway 17L that needed to be guided to runway 17R before transferring ownership to the PP6 position A researcher assigned to the room monitored the pseudo-pilots to answer any questions and resolve the occasional pseudo-pilot computer-entry error.Another researcher sat at the Researcher station to monitor the Ground and Local SMS Controller stations and the GPS station.This researcher also watched for system or performance anomalies.Additionally, the Researcher's SMS displays were configured to make screen recordings of the monitor.The video was recorded into Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) movies for making demonstrations and post-run data analysis.During a run, the video contents were routed to the video projector located in the Briefing Room.The Briefing Room.The Briefing Room hosted visitors, observers, and additional researchers, and was a place where people could congregate to observe the live broadcast of the simulation without disrupting the participants during the data runs.Live audio between the controllers and pseudo-pilots was also fed into the Briefing Room, with the controller feed (ground or local) selectable.This room allowed for open discussions and questions between visitors and researchers.It also served as the pre-and postrun briefing area.
Recording CapabilitiesEach data collection run during the HITL included video recordings of the simulation displays and audio recordings of the voice communications between controllers and pseudo-pilots.The video recordings consisted of the screen capture of the Researcher SMS display during a run, captured into an MPEG movie.Each recording used the xvidcap 5
Input DeviceAll workstations (Solaris, Linux, and Windows) used a keyboard and mouse for user input.Additionally, voice communications between controllers and pilots were transmitted using SimPhonics digital radio headsets.
DisplayThe workstation displays used for the SARDA HITL are described in this section.In the Test Engineer Room, the ATG workstation had one 24-inch display.The GM and Super GPS workstations each had one 20-inch display.The SMS core processes workstation had one 24-inch and one 19-inch display.In the Controller/Pilot Room, the controller workstations used multiple 24-inch displays: ground had three, local had two, and the spare station had two.The Researcher workstation had three 20-inch displays.Each pilot GPS station had one 20-inch display.The SimPhonics6 radio systems had one 15-inch display each.The following figures show the test engineer room (fig.A7), ground and local displays (figs.A8 and A9), pseudo-pilot station (fig.A10), and the researcher station displays (fig.A11).
NetworkThe SARDA HITL used the 100 Mbit/s full duplex network infrastructure supplied by the FFC facility.No other network upgrades were required to support the SARDA experiment.
Software Configuration and UsageThe SMS software operates in real time and includes a mature user interface thus making it well suited for use in HITL studies.Modular (plug-in) components can be implemented within the SMS model to interact with surface schedulers.SMS has knowledge about the airport layout and aircraft dynamics.It can create shortest path taxi routes from a flight's current position to its destination (departure runway or arrival spot).SMS requires aircraft track inputs, and ATG provides the simulated traffic.
Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG), [Version 2.16.2]ATG provides simulated aircraft track data to the SMS system.ATG, as used during the SARDA simulations, is made up of three major components: the Ground Manager, Ground Pilot Station, and the ATMTE messaging translator.The components run under various hardware and operating systems, but they work cohesively to provide two major functions.Besides being a target generator, ATG also provides an interface to each pseudo-pilot, allowing for the control of multiple aircraft, typically up to eight.During the SARDA runs, the Ground Manager was configured to run in the Test Engineer room while the Ground Pilot Station ran in the Controller/Pilot Room.
The Ground Manager (GM), [Version 3.3.5].The GM provided communication of flight plans and aircraft track data between SMS and the Ground Pilot Stations.The GM also managed the connectivity between multiple pilot stations.
The Ground Pilot Station (GPS), [Version 3.3.5].The GPS is the primary user interface to the pseudo-pilot.Within the GPS, the pilot can issue various aircraft commands such as speed and heading, as well as routing information for the aircraft to follow.Each pseudo-pilot typically controls multiple aircraft and assigns aircraft movement based on verbal communication with either ground or local controllers.As the aircraft exits the control domain of one pseudo-pilot, it is handed off to the receiving pseudo-pilot (fig.A12).Two configurations for GPS were used in the SARDA HITL: Super GPS and pilot GPS.The Super GPS executed prescribed command files, which contain automated instructions to control aircraft that were not within the scope of interest of the present study.It was configured to show the entire airport surface so that a researcher could monitor and resolve traffic artifacts.Super GPS ran on its own Windows NT workstation in the Test Engineer Room.GPS displays for the pseudo-pilots ran on separate Windows workstations in the Controller/Pilot Room, one for each pseudo-pilot.They were configured to show the specific area of the airport surface assigned to each pilot.Pilots received verbal instructions from controllers, located the flight on the GPS, and issued the corresponding aircraft commands.Figure A12 shows a sample GPS display that includes various display elements.The map of DFW is shown in green, depicting Terminals A and C (dark semicircles) located on the left-hand side of the picture.Shown on the terminals are the gate numbers (e.g., A33, C17) and two aircraft (in pink) heading toward spots 7 and 22.On the right-hand side of the figure is an overlaying map of the arrival (17C) and departure (17R) runways, with aircraft flowing from the top to the bottom of the map.Also shown is the command keys window, "Cmd Keys," which assigns regularly-used instructions to the aircraft.Other instructions can be typed into the "Cmd Text Entry" window to manipulate aircraft movement.Below that is the "Target List," which displays all aircraft owned by this particular pseudo-pilot.Near the bottom of the window column is the "Commander" window that allows aircraft controls to be made via the mouse instead of using the keyboard.The SARDA HITL required a few changes to ATG ground and GPS maps for alignment with the SMS airport adaptation.Spot locations were moved a few feet back into the ramp areas for Terminals A, C, and E, so that aircraft stopping at a spot would not have its nose encroaching into the taxiway on the SMS display.Some node locations were modified to more closely match up to the SMS airport adaptation.The ATG aircraft-type database was changed to use lower taxi speeds in turns and ramp areas for selected aircraft types.The anti-stack (in-trail anti-collision functionality in ATG) distance between targets was set to 1.6 times the fuselage length of the trailing aircraft to mimic nominal separation distance based on SME feedback.
Air Traffic Message Translation Engine (ATMTE), [Version 1.4]. ATMTE manages the communication of flight plans and tracks data from ATG to SMS.ATMTE acts as a translation engine, converting information such as node names (system adaptation specific information), and messaging type and format, between the ATG and SMS.Data transfer is achieved via Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) sockets between ATG and the CapServer component of SMS.For the SARDA runs, ATMTE shared a Linux workstation with the SMS core processes in the Test Engineer Room.
Aircraft List or Scenario File.The "aircraft list" defines the traffic scenario to be run in the simulation.Aircraft details such as call sign, aircraft type, departure and arrival airports, and spots, are specified in this text file.ATG reads in this file during initialization to generate the aircraft traffic.As ATG generates track for these aircraft, they are sent over to SMS along with other types of information such as flight plans.The scenario file defines the number of departures and arrivals in a simulation and when each aircraft is to be activated (e.g., produce first target return on a radar system).SARDA runs had departures simulated at the gate moving toward takeoff and up to 10 nautical miles (nm) after being airborne.Arrivals would approach from the final approach fix (about a 10 nm radius from the center of the airport, not at end of runway threshold), land, and then taxi to the spot and gate.More details on the scenario generation process are included in Appendix E: Scenario Development.Command List.Command files define aircraft ownership based on assigned sectors, for both automated pilots and the human pseudo-pilots.It specifies flight characteristics (such as assigned speed) and handoff characteristics.The Command List can control aircraft in the ramp areas, westside traffic, and takeoffs on runways 17R and 18L for departures.For arrivals, the automated sectors can control landing on runways 17C, 17L, 18R, and 13R to runway crossings, and the taxi routes to spots and gates.For this study, turboprops using runway 13L were not simulated.Two simulation traffic levels were defined: normal (40 departures, 40 arrivals) and heavy (64 departures, 60 arrivals) (see Appendix F: Historical Input Files for Scenario Generation).The command list may include instructions for the automated pilot to hand off aircraft to a pseudo-pilot controlled sector.Conversely, pseudo-pilots can also hand off aircraft to automated sectors; for example, actions such as moving the aircraft from the spot to the gate and removing it from the simulation after some predefined period.
Surface Management System (SMS), [Version 8.3]SMS is organized into multiple components such as the CM, CMUI, Model, GUI, and CapServer. 7f these, integration of the SARDA scheduling algorithm into SMS software is done via one of the plug-in components in the SMS Model Plug-ins module (fig.A13).The model's plug-in architecture was developed using a notional concept depicted in figure A14.From the figure, the Spot Release Planner (SRP) is associated with the Scheduler module embedded within the larger Departure Scheduler box.This figure outlines some of the decision support functionality that may be needed by the surface Decision Support Tool (DST) to help tower controllers.For example, a Departure Scheduler (DS) may need input from a Noise Restriction Calculator to determine the aircraft's departure time, and the DS may need to iterate a solution with the Taxi Optimization and Deconfliction module before producing a final advisory that a tower controller can use.The SRP computed the optimal sequence and time to release a flight from the spot, so it was logical to implement the SRP algorithm as a Push-Back Calculator plug-in.The Runway Scheduler (RS) was implemented as a Taxiway Optimizer and Deconfliction plug-in, because it computed the best sequence for departures to takeoff and arrivals to cross a runway.The SMS software has built-in placeholders for the other functionalities such as the Departure Runway Balancer (DRB).For completeness, a white paper describing possible deployment of modular architecture in support of other airport interaction is presented in Appendix I: Distributed Surface Management Governance Model (DISSEMINATE).
Development of Scheduler Plug-in Modules.SMS is written in Java and is organized into multiple components, CM, CMUI, Model, Client GUI, and CapServer (fig.A3).In support of the SESO research, the SMS software was redesigned to provide a modular plug-in architecture thus providing flexibility for researchers to develop and conduct surface management studies.This section describes in some detail the development of the two plug-ins modules used in the SARDA tests.The SMS Model component allows for integration of external schedulers via its plug-in architecture.For SARDA, two algorithms were integrated into the SMS Model: SRP and RS.Both modules are written in C++, whereas SMS development solely uses the Java language.The ATG developer created two separate wrappers, one for the SRP and the other for RS, encapsulating necessary flight data from other SMS subsystems and facilitating data exchange.
Development of SrpPBPlugin.SMS uses a plug-in architecture designed to let users replace any of the SMS default plug-ins with their own custom components.The developers implemented the SARDA wrappers as custom plug-ins for two of the Model's components: Push-Back Calculator (PB) and Taxiway Optimizer and Deconfliction (TOD) (fig.A15).They developed the SrpPBPlugin to manage all the data required by the SRP algorithm and all the data that it returned.The wrapper collected aircraft data from SMS such as position and route, sent this data to SRP via a socket, read back advisory data from SRP, and stored that data into SMS for display on the SMS graphical user interface.The calculated data from the scheduler gave the time to first node and time to last node.Time to first node was the SRP-computed ideal time for an aircraft to be released from the spot.The times were sorted to create a sequence for departure aircraft leaving the ramp area.Aircraft with a sequence of one represented the first aircraft to depart.Number two represented the second aircraft in the queue, and so forth.Both the sequence number and the countdown time (in seconds until the aircraft should be released from the spot) were displayed to the controllers on the aircraft's datatag.Figure A15 shows a sample aircraft with a sequence of "2" (on the top line of the datatag) and a countdown time of "33" seconds (bottom line on datatag).A downward pointing arrow is the aircraft icon, which is located right above spot number 22.
Development of RsPlugin.The RsPlugin was designed to handle the requirements of the RS algorithm.It received data from SMS such as a list of aircraft, their positions, whether they were arrivals or departures, and their assigned runway.The flight data were sent to RS via a socket connection.The advisories returned from RS were saved in SMS, and routed and displayed on the GUI.The returned advisory data from the scheduler gave the time to last node.For aircraft in the departure queue, "last node" indicated the time (relative to the present time, in seconds) that the aircraft should take off.For arrival aircraft, "last node" indicated the time that the aircraft should cross the active departure runway (runway 17R for the SARDA test) to reach the arrival spots.The times to the last node were used to compute the sequence in which arrivals should use the runway.The aircraft that should use the runway first was labeled number one; the next aircraft in sequence labeled number two, etc.For arrival aircraft that were to cross the runway simultaneously, all were grouped together and had the same sequence number.Simultaneous crossings are defined as all crossings that do not have a departure in between them.
Algorithm Integration Within Plug-in Modules.The optimization algorithm programs ran on a remote Linux system.Initially, the scheduling algorithms used the CPLEX8 solver for computations, but CPLEX was not used for the actual SARDA HITL runs.In a typical operation, the scheduler and the SRP wrapper ran on different host machines.SMS plug-ins communicated with the algorithms over TCP/IP sockets.Data sent from the plug-in modules to the algorithms were formatted into plain text separated by spaces and new lines.This data included which algorithm was called, the number of arrivals and departures in the simulation, departure fix and runway crossing usage, numeric identifiers for aircraft, aircraft simulation activation times, and aircraft taxi routes.Once the plain text string was created, it was passed to the algorithm via a socket.The algorithm completed its calculations and returned the advisory in a string.This string contained the aircraft identifier and a series of times indicating when the scheduler expected the aircraft to cross each taxi route node.For the SARDA simulation, only the first node and last node were passed.The rest of the route was passed as zeroes and ignored by SMS.
SMS-ATG Software Integration, Lesson LeanedThe SMS-CM had difficulties processing large numbers of CTAS-CAP Server messages.This problem was discovered during SARDA integration testing, where flight track data for up to 100 aircraft was sent through the CTAS-CAP Server interface from ATG to SMS.The result was that the ATG and SMS aircraft displays did not stay synchronized with each other.The SMS-CAP Server appeared to receive data in a timely manner and queued them for processing.However, SMS was not able to keep up with the queued track messages for more than 65 aircraft.This was determined by turning on queue debug messages in the SMS-CAP server.The debug messages printed out the queue size every 1,000 messages processed.Debug messages were also printed in SMS-CM where it read in the CAP messages, to indicate when 1,000 messages had been processed.After 65 aircraft were active in the simulation, the SMS-CM's CAP message queue was not emptied before the next processing cycle.The first attempted solution to the problem was to change the socket sleep time from 25 milliseconds to 5 milliseconds per cycle, so that the thread could potentially be accessed more frequently to drain the message queue.This did not resolve the issue, however.The second solution, which resolved the problem, was to bundle the messages.Originally, the SMS-CAP server would send the data for each aircraft in its own message.By bundling the messages, the current data for all aircraft were gathered into a list, which was sent as a single message to SMS-CM.By handling just a single message instead of N messages, SMS-CM was able to keep up with data updates and the SMS GUI stayed synchronized with ATG.
Roles and Responsibilities
ControllersThe SARDA HITL data runs employed two retired DFW air traffic controllers, one with supervisory experience.The controllers were asked to switch positions (from Ground to Local and vice versa) after each run.Ground Controller.The ground controller's responsibilities included clearing flights to taxi from spots to departure runway, and to coordinate departures and arrivals leaving and entering the ramp area.The ground controller received advisories from the SRP for the optimal sequence and time to release departures from spots.As the countdown timer falls under 60 seconds, a green background box is superimposed over the timer's text field, which is nominally turquoise in color.From the time the background box turns green, the controller has 60 seconds to push that aircraft from the spot to the Airport Movement Area (AMA) or taxiway.If multiple aircraft are ready to push, the controller gives priority to the lower sequence number.The flexible release window allows the controller opportunity to fit the aircraft around the existing flow of traffic.Examples of datatag and timeline advisories for the ground controller are shown in figures 4 and 5 in the main body of the report, pages 36 and 37, respectively (Human-in-the-Loop Simulation Evaluation, Display Options).Local Controller.The local controller's responsibilities involved clearing flights to depart from runway 17R, clearing arrivals to land on 17C (optionally under controller discretion, including which runway exit to take), and clearing arrivals landing on runway 17L to cross 17C and 17R.The local controller received advisories from the RS for the optimal sequence to use 17R for departing flights or crossing arrivals.Unlike the ground controller, the local controller only sees sequence advisories generated by the RS.A typical presentation of the RS information to the local controller is shown in figures 6 and 7 in the main body of the report, pages 38 and 39, respectively.Note the sequence number on the datatag.On the sequence list, the first aircraft for release is displayed at the bottom of the list with later aircraft on top.The local controller should cross all arrivals with the same crossing sequence before launching the next departure.Both ground and local controllers ensured that the appropriate safety separation between flights was maintained.The controllers viewed and managed aircraft traffic using the SMS GUI map displays.They issued verbal clearances via a digital radio system to pseudo-pilots to move aircraft, and logged the commands via the keyboard for data analysis.
Pseudo-pilotsManned Pseudo-Pilot.Pseudo-pilots (PPs) were responsible for multiple aircraft including maintaining radio contact with controllers and moving flights as commanded by controllers, either from spots to runways for departures, or from runways to spots for arrivals.They also maintained safe separation between flights.Pilots managed flights in geographically assigned areas on the airport.As a flight left their area of responsibility, they handed off the flight to the neighboring pilot.Conversely, a pilot may receive a handoff from a neighboring pilot.Manned pilots can also send and receive aircraft from the automated pilots (see below).Pilots viewed and moved aircraft traffic using
GPS displays (see Appendix D: Pseudo-Pilot Training Material).Automated Pseudo-Pilot.Automated pilots controlled certain parts of the airport.These areas were considered ancillary to the experiment but nonetheless, the aircraft needed to be controlled until they entered or left the research domain.Such areas included movement within the gate and ramp areas, and traffic movement on the west side of the airport.Although SARDA runs focused on the east side of the airport, the scenario had aircraft arriving and departing on the west side of the airport.Automated pilots controlled all west-side movements.These pilots also controlled airborne arrivals heading for runways 17C and 17L.The 17C aircraft was automatically handed off to manned pilots before touchdown.On 17L, it controlled the aircraft to touchdown, rolled, and held short of the 17C, then handed off the aircraft to the manned pilot.
ResearchersResearchers' roles encompassed many areas, including algorithm development, software development, systems integration, human factors, simulation scenario development, and data analysis.Their responsibilities for the SARDA HITL included additional tasks such as training of controllers on SARDA concept and tool, and pseudo-pilots on ATG usage, and observing controllers' and pseudo-pilots' interactions to ensure acceptable workload level by balancing the pseudo-pilot-to-aircraft ratio.Human factors researchers sat with each controller and noted comments about the simulation system or advisories, trends in controller traffic preferences, and suggestions for improvement.One researcher acted as a liaison between the Controller/Pilot and Test Engineer Rooms to quickly resolve issues brought up by the research team.Another researcher stayed in the Test Engineer Room to start and stop the simulation software components, monitor their health and performance during the simulation, and archive log files after each run.A third researcher served as technical support to the PP, answering questions and resolving problems.Other researchers in the Briefing Rooms monitored the Researcher SMS station during simulations to observe the simulation progress and the interactions between controller and pilots.Most of the development and calibration of the tools happened during the initial shakedown and shakedown runs conducted in December 2009 and March 2010, respectively.The April runs relied primarily on the human factors researchers observing, taking notes, distributing questionnaires, and conducting post-run interviews.The rest of the team worked behind the scene to ensure proper system operations and to reduce distraction of the controllers and pilots.Retired tower controllers from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) were brought in to give the researchers a first glimpse into the implementation of the optimized surface movement concept.Their feedback was used to hone the subsequent procedures.One of the subject matter experts (SMEs) joined the research team and helped with providing training materials for the DFW controllers.The SME acted as a liaison between the researcher and controllers and proved advantageous for both sides.
Simulated Scenario DevelopmentThe Air Traffic Generator (ATG) uses text-based scenario files to generate simulated aircraft traffic for the SARDA HITL.Additionally, ATG uses the command list file to issue scripted commands used by the automated pilots, thus controlling the behaviors of the automated aircraft.The simulation scenario is defined by the arrangement of aircraft specified within the scenario file.The file specifies the activation time and location where aircraft position are to be generated (resembling ground or airborne radar surveillance data), their destination (a gate/spot combination at DFW for arrivals, an airport other than DFW for departures), and an initial set of instructions for the aircraft.These instructions manage the trajectory of the flight and assign ownership of the aircraft to one of the pseudo-pilots.A combination of Matlab scripts and manual adjustments were used to create the aircraft list (see Appendix E: Scenario Development).One of the options in the Matlab scripts determines how aircraft are created in time relative to each other.This feature allows for the creation of simulated peak demand periods within the scenario.Two high-traffic peak times were selected: one very early in the simulation and another toward the middle of the scenario.This type of demand profile allowed researchers the opportunity to observe the system and controller participants' performance and reaction with changing traffic loads.For example, the generated scenario can be crafted to allow time for the system and participants to recover from the first peak, or it can create a sustainably higher traffic load by creating the second peak to occur relatively soon after the first peak.When aircraft pushed back from the gate, there was a possibility of "collision" if proper temporal separation was not vetted in the development of the scenario file.The aircraft were under automated pilot control in the ramp area, so the only resolution was to ensure that the pushback times for the aircraft were sufficiently far apart that they did not use the same piece of pavement at the same time.This is an order n-squared problem because every gate had to be checked against every other gate.The solution was to create a table that had a matrix of spots and times.The x-axis showed first aircraft pushing back while the y-axis indicated the following aircraft.The values themselves were the minimum times in seconds that the aircraft needed to be separated.This matrix was not symmetrical.When the scenario files were created in Matlab, the Matlab script referenced this file and did not allow any aircraft to be created within the times defined in the matrix.Another issue discovered in earlier HITLs was that the controllers quickly memorized the scenarios, call signs, and patterns.To prevent the controllers from recognizing previous scenarios, aircraft call signs were renumbered randomly to create five times as many scenarios.There were four unique scenarios, so this change brought the total up to 20 effective scenarios.To save time and reduce manual labor, a program was written to randomize the call sign.Because the airline distribution was fairly accurate, the airline part of the call sign was kept the same.The number of digits in the call sign was also kept the same; however the digits themselves were randomized.DFW is an American Airlines (AAL) hub and has a substantial footprint at the terminals.Prior analysis using the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool gave the research team the appropriate ratio of AAL flights compared to other airlines at each of the Terminals (A, C, and E). 9 This was necessary to keep the scenario reflective of current-day carrier distribution and to keep the controllers' focus on the tools and not let the scenario distract them from the desired tasks.The first pass of this program did not check for call sign number uniqueness.Later, it checked for and resolved call sign number conflicts.There were still some numbers that were close together that were not detected by the system such as AAL261 and AAL621.This was such a rare occurrence that it was addressed on a case-by-case basis.The aircraft in the initial scenario files were created with sufficient separation between them.However, multiple manual changes were made to the scenario file without regard to maintaining separation.The files had to be modified to preserve the required separation, especially after the landing of a heavy aircraft (i.e., a B772) or a landing that went all the way down to exit M7.This issue was raised by SMEs during earlier simulation runs and was resolved before the data collection runs.Initially, all arrival aircraft were assigned to the default high-speed exit of M7.However, the SMEs noted that this took unnecessary extra time and would not happen operationally.The practice also caused many backups at M7 if the local controller was not changing the route, and made for suboptimal planning for the RS.The solution was to select the runway exit depending on the terminal to which the arrival was headed and to automatically route the flight there.Terminal-A-destined aircraft would take exit M3, Terminal C aircraft would take exit M4, and Terminal E aircraft would take exit M7.Exit M6 was used for heavy aircraft destined for Terminals A and C.This solved the problem and reduced the amount of arrivals that the local controller would have to change before landing.The activation location for arrival aircraft was originally set at 5 nautical miles (nm) upstream from the runway threshold.However, this did not give the controllers enough time to carry out check-in procedures (radio, communication of clearance for landing), so the distance was doubled to 10 nm.The controllers preferred that arrivals be activated at 20 nm out, but the computations required (flight time modeling in SMS) were not feasible within the available integration time frame.RS needed more accurate time estimates than SMS could provide for when arrivals would reach 17R runway crossings.To increase accuracy, the time estimates were manually computed by timing arrivals from activation until they reached the hold short point at 17R for every aircraft type at every runway exit (M3, M4, M6, M7, A, and ER).â€¢ SMS weight class string, Heavy, Large, B757, Small â€¢ Equivalent numeric value, 0, 1, 2, 3

APPENDIX E: SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT Scenario Generation Using MatlabFor evaluation of proposed concepts and advisories, "scenarios" of traffic are a critical component.It is important that these scenarios are based on actual operations at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) airport.A Matlab-based infrastructure was developed to facilitate the development of these scenarios, with many of its components being based on historical statistics obtained from Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA). 1ote: The parameter files (text files ending in 'txt') mentioned here are used as inputs by the Matlab m-files (e.g., WeightClassPercentages.txt).The scenarios produced from the Matlab scripts are in a format appropriate for input to Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG) (see Appendix G: ATG Scenario Files for April 2010 Simulations).The scenarios were generated for a south-flow configuration, with departures on 17R and 18L and arrivals on 17C, 17L, 18R, and 13L.Three types of scenarios can be generated depending on the requirements:â€¢ Type 1 Scenarios are a duplicate of an actual day (or partial day) at DFW airport.Data is collected using SODAA and run through Matlab scripts to create a scenario file that closely resembles the operations collected using SODAA.â€¢ Type 2 Scenarios use seed day data from DFW airport collected using SODAA.The trends (airport departure and arrival rates throughout the day) are used to create scenarios, scaling up to five times the traffic level of the seed traffic.DFW airport usage statistics collected using SODAA are used to assign starting locations and destinations for the flights throughout the scenario.â€¢ Type 3 Scenarios are created from user inputs of number of aircraft, scenario length, and airport trends.The trends (airport departure and arrival rates throughout the day) are used with DFW airport usage statistics collected using SODAA to assign starting locations and destinations for the flights throughout the scenario.User inputs (c) and (d) determines how the flights are scattered throughout the scenario.There are five different options for the loading parameter: equal, front, back, random, and hybrid.The hybrid option uses a combination of the other four loading characteristics.Figure E1 shows all five options: the larger the count, the more flights there are in that time frame.For example, a front-loaded scenario will have more flights scheduled near the start of the scenario, while back loading results in more flights scheduled near the end of the scenario.There are various files that provide historical statistics collected through SODAA, and these provide the following essential information necessary for the scenario generation (see Appendix F: Historical Input Files for Scenario Generation).Weight Classes: The text file "WeightClassPercentages.txt" determines the mix of weight classes in the scenario.
Spots:The text file "SpotPercentages.txt"determines the mix of spots used, as well as what category (arrival or departure) can use them.There are some spots that are labeled "Large Only."You will not find these in the text file, only in the m-file.This was done after the December Simulation, where it was found that Heavy's and B757's should not go to some spots.The reason for this is that a Heavy or B757 will collide with aircraft that are using adjacent spots.
Runways:Runways are determined according to the text files "DepartureRunwayPercentages.txt" and "ArrivalRunwayPercentages.txt."The runway is assigned with respect to the flight's weight class and spot location/destination.For example, if a Heavy is located on the east side of DFW, it is 85 percent likely to be assigned runway 17R for departure.Arrival Spacing: Arrival flights are separated on the runway according to a value for runway occupancy time.Runway occupancy times were found for various aircraft types on each arrival runway.The largest value for runway occupancy time was used as the separation value.This ensures that no flight will be scheduled to land while another flight occupies the runway.
Gate Clear Time:The estimated time it takes a departure flight to push back and clear the gate area so that an arrival flight can come in to park.
Turnaround Time:The time from when an arrival flight parks at a gate to when it is ready to push back for departure.Aircraft Type: Aircraft types are assigned according to data collected at DFW airport using SODAA.Using the flight's weight class, an aircraft type is assigned according to the percentages in the following files: "SmallTypePercentages.txt""LargeTypePercentages.txt""HeavyTypePercentages.txt""B757TypePercentages.txt"
APPENDIX F: HISTORICAL INPUT FILES FOR SCENARIO GENERATION
BACKGROUNDThe Safe and Efficient Surface Operations (SESO) research focus area (RFA) is tasked with investigating optimization techniques to improve ground movement efficiency.The algorithms will include modeling of uncertainty in scheduling events without impinging upon safety.Furthermore, environmental impact factors such as emissions, particulate matter, noise, and fuel burn will need to be integrated into the optimization process.Altogether, the solution needs to take into consideration three major constraining factors: safety, uncertainty, and environmental impacts.Secondary factors, such as airlines' requests and collaboration with other decision support tools (DSTs) will be address at a later time.Ascertaining an optimized solution for each factor is achievable with some degree of effort, depending on the level of desired fidelity and output requirements.However, finding an optimized solution that satisfies all three factors while providing viable advisories in real time is a major challenge to researchers in this domain.The real-time solution is of paramount importance when having the human operators interacting with the system to control traffic.The real-time requirement is relaxed during initial research phases.To date, the SESO research team has been actively working on building optimizers for the taxi scheduler, spot release advisor, and runway scheduler.A fast-time simulator, Surface Optimization Simulator and Scheduler (SOSS), has been constructed to prototype, verify, and validate the functionality (ref.1).SOSS allows for rapid prototyping and analysis of initial trends offered by the algorithms.When a design goal is reached, the algorithm gets migrated into the real-time simulator for further analysis.A real-time, high-fidelity simulator is being developed to accommodate human operators and gain valuable feedback on topics like workability, feasibility, and usability.The real-time simulator is capable of systematic introduction of uncertainty modeling, like variation in taxi speed and aircraft activation time.The re-architected Surface Management System (SMS) software employs a plug-in architecture to facilitate the development, integration, testing, and contrasting of various algorithms. 1he SMS plug-in architecture is key to assisting the researchers with developing and testing variations of scheduling and taxiing algorithms.From a system architecture perspective, the plug-in SMS architecture allows for great flexibility in system development.It allows for concurrent development of similar-type modules by NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or any other organizations.The common or core SMS architecture can accommodate various plug-in modules, allowing for easy reconfiguration of the tool to support different objectives.It can be configured as a pure research tool, a Decision Support Tool (DST) for operational use, or as a prototype system mixing operational modules with research modules.A primary consideration for future air transportation needs is the requirement to control up to three times current-day traffic, as specified by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO).The increase in traffic is expected to add additional burden on the computational engine (COGINE) to deliver a viable solution in real time.In an era of three times the current demand, how can a surface automation tool be deployed to compliment the human workforce during nominal and off-nominal conditions?One school of thought suggests that the system be fully automated while, at the other end of the spectrum, the human still occupies the decision-making role.The third option falls somewhere between the two extremes whereby the human will interact with more sophisticated automation systems.All the proposed role changes will require modifications to current-day operational procedures and aircraft (control) ownership structure.The development and deployment of an advanced surface automation system that produces optimized schedules using environmental, safety, uncertainty, and timely calculated results are the inspiration for this white paper.It is the convergence of these weighty factors that forces the examination of using a distributed system.The distributed framework is expected to provide a mechanism where the objectives can be met in real time.The Distributed Surface Management Governance Model (DISSEMINATE) framework sets out to address the following factors: computational efficiency (real time), flexible and robust system configuration, integration and harmonization of human and automation, and system recovery.This white paper is broken down into three sections.The first section defines the need for such a distributed model.The next section defines the proposed architecture for the surface domain, and the last section provides sample applications of the benefits of the flexible framework.
THE DISTIBUTED SURFACE MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE MODEL (DISSEMINATE)
Objectives and RequirementsThe SMS architecture provides an appropriate level of situation awareness to assist traffic management coordinators with a current-day level of traffic.However, the architecture may not offer enough robustness with the expected increase in traffic and complexity of computation.The DISSEMINATE concept proactively proposes a notional architecture and governance model that sets out to address anticipated system performance bottlenecks and limitations due to increase of demand and incorporation of more stringent requirements.In addition, the governance model provides a platform to investigate the human-automation interaction, such as roles and responsibility, and the transfer of authority between humans and automation.Furthermore, the distributed model is designed for scalability and can provide a framework for examination of Metroplex operations with prospective integration into the terminal and en route domains (refs.2,3).To meet the goals outlined above, DISSEMINATE will: 1) architect a framework that promotes computational efficiency; 2) provide a robust, configurable, and scalable architecture to provide research into multiple domains; 3) construct an environment to investigate the roles of the humans and automation (interactive mode, training mode, and system recovery mode are discussed in following sections).
Characteristics of DISSEMINATEThe overarching design of the DISSEMINATE model is its modularity.The modularity is carried through the entire architecture from the subsystem, the system, and throughout the distributed system.Its core architecture is designed for efficiency and extensibility.The distributed architecture developed for the Multi-Center Traffic Management Advisor (McTMA) is used as a template in developing the DISSEMINATE framework (refs. 4-7).Key characteristics include a distributed network, facilitation of collaboration and coordination between adjacent control units, and providing multiple levels of control over the system for dealing with localized or regional problems.The DISSEMINATE framework is envisioned to provide a robust platform to support advance research in the surface domain such as ground taxi optimization, with possible extension to nearby airports.The research objectives and problems are quite different between McTMA and DISSEMINATE systems, but the distributed (metering capability) are common objectives to both systems.
Computational Efficiency and Real-Time RequirementsFinding an optimized solution can be a computationally intensive task.Calculating optimized taxi solutions for many aircraft in real time at frequent update rates can push the system to its limit.Therefore, computational efficiency plays a major factor when the system is used in a real-time environment (as a decision support tool).The real-time interactive requirement also places a sizable barrier to acquiring a solution.There are ways to overcome such hurdles, like obtaining faster hardware (brute force), reducing the fidelity of the model (using heuristics), and applying more efficient coding standards.DISSEMINATE takes an approach that retains the complexity and fidelity of the problem but breaks it down into more manageable segments.The approach takes the stance that as the complex problem domain is scaled down into smaller segments, the algorithm will have a better probability of producing a workable solution in real time.The tradeoff may require more hardware (not top-of-theline central processing units (CPUs)) to calculate the sub-unit problems, but may provide more realistic deployment of the system (reduced cost).The most powerful piece of hardware in the suite can be used to solve the most intensive tasks while less powerful computers can solve ancillary and non-time-critical duties.Scale the hardware requirements to the needs of the facility.
ExtensibilityDISSEMINATE is built upon a very flexible and modular framework.The framework is designed with extensibility and scalability in mind.This capability can be extremely useful to both operational and research groups.Extensibility allows researchers to investigate multiple variations in concept, or distinct concepts, which may be complementary to one another.Scalability refers to the architecture's ability to add or delete components when adapted at larger or smaller airports.Scalability also means if more than one instance of DISSEMINATE is operational, they can be integrated to govern a larger domain.These two characteristics are built into the foundational architecture of the system.This core characteristic is carried throughout the framework, affecting designs of the subsystem's computational engine (COGINE), system, and extended network.The concept of COGINE is defined in section 2.4.Section 3 shows how a Metroplex can be modeled using the DISSEMINATE framework.The subsystem can accommodate new technology or improved modeling components, as they become available.Such components may include taxi scheduling, runway balancing, noise and emission modeling, and weather forecasting.Refer to section 2.4, the Computational Engine (COGINE), for more details.The modularity also allows for the concurrent development of similarly functional components.These components can have similar, different, or complimentary functions, and yet all can coexist and interact with each other.However, the users or researchers do need to set guidelines for the level of interaction and the nature of the collaboration.Operationally, the design of the distributed systems will depend on the needs of the facility and may be restricted by the physical limitations of the airport, Air Traffic Control (ATC) facility, and controllable domain, to name a few examples.In the laboratory, this extensibility characteristic allows researchers to investigate alternative concepts and out-the-box thinking by designing subsystems within DISSEMINATE that can be interchangeably replaced without reduced effort and downtime.
Human and Automation IntegrationProof of concept test runs in a simulator can uncover hidden or unforeseen situations.DISSEMINATE is well suited for this purpose, as well as being a training tool, and a mechanism to systematically investigate transfer of authority between automation and the human operator during highly congested traffic conditions.Built upon the current SMS baseline, DISSEMINATE is expected to be able to operate in a simulation environment.The capability exists today for SMS to operate with the users during human-in-the-loop (HITL) runs.Likewise, the system can be configured to accommodate and complement human operator actions, while certain tasks are totally controlled by the automation.This human-automation model has already been used extensively to validate other concepts (ref.4).DISSEMINATE retains this feature.Like SMS, DISSEMINATE also operates as a real-time system.With little effort, the simulation environment can be transformed into a training class where controllers can come in to sharpen their skills.DISSEMINATE can be configured to control most aspects of the airport while allowing the trainee to control other aspects of the domain, like taxi route movement during training.The modular framework of DISSEMINATE is designed to support such scenarios.But this capability can offer up an even more ingenious application during operational use.DISSEMINATE's modular framework offers a technique to reintroduce the human operator into a highly automated and congestion environment if a subsystem becomes inoperative.The solution looks very much like a training scenario where the downed subsystem is replaced with a human operator.DISSEMINATE can start the recovery process by issuing more conservative constraints to automation units, which abuts the domain of the human operator (see section 3.3 for more details).Efficiency is expected to diminish, but may allow for the interjection of the human operator to control the problem.This feature may also provide a great vehicle for further research.
The DISSEMINATE ArchitectureThe DISSEMINATE framework aims to build upon an existing tool, the Surface Management System (SMS).The SMS has significance because it is the tool NASA currently uses to conduct surface optimization research.It is envisioned that the DISSEMINATE architecture will supersede that of the SMS architecture while fully capitalizing on its modular plug-in design. 2All current algorithmic developments and activities can be carried forward.SMS provides the basic architecture to obtain data feeds and routing of user display visuals.DISSEMINATE aims to capitalize on the current SMS modular framework by promoting more data sharing between subsystems and other instances of the DISSEMINATE system, like that of the Metroplex (refs.2,3).DISSEMINATE tackles the complex and intensive surface optimization solution by employing elegant design rather than applying brute force.The model partitions the complex surface domain into smaller segments where the various optimizers and COGINEs can produce solutions quicker.Conceptually, the smaller domain segments (which can be modeled to represent the control points in the physical world) are mapped to a COGINE that computes solutions for that domain.The COGINE thus becomes a proxy for the physical world.The COGINE works independently to solve localized problems and coordinates with adjacent COGINEs to offer collaborative solutions.A COGINE is a construct used to represent the division of a larger problem, breaking it down to subproblems and collaboratively working toward a solution.Hence, the COGINE can represent any of the identified functionalities of the airport surface.The SMS architecture (up to version 8.3) uses a centralized approach to attack every aspect of the airport problem (fig.I.1).It employs a single instance of SMS to devise a solution for the entire airport.The singular approach needs to change to offer more robustness and satisfy the research objectives.As an example of using DISSEMINATE, the airport domain is strategically divided into smaller sub-domains.Calculation efficiency can be gained by optimizing over a smaller area of the airport (fig.I.2).The actual creation of the sub-domain sectors at any particular airport is left as an exercise for others to pursue.Figure I.2 shows one possible representation for the DFW airport.However, there are some important parameters that can influence the acceptability and usability of the design.Factors such as the location of change in control (handoff), geographic demarcation, environmental restrictions, and historically high workload areas should be taken into consideration during the design process.Any critical fallback procedure should also be considered, such as when a human needs to interject and take over control of a degraded (situation) area while collaboratively working with automation, which still controls adjacent areas.This piecemeal collaboration, or modular approach, has been tried once before in the en route domain.The multi-center traffic management advisor (McTMA) adapted the distributed computing model to address the extended and regional nature of controlling congested traffic in the northeast into the Philadelphia airport.The four McTMA systems were configured to meet the needs of the Air Traffic Management (ATM) operator, and constraints of the airspace and system.The systems The basic distributed system architecture and communication protocol learned from the McTMA system will integrate into the DISSEMINATE model.Conceptually, there are many similarities between the en route and surface model.SMS uses the node-link model to describe the taxi route on the surface.In the en route, McTMA uses air routes (links) and a scheduling complex (nodes with built-in scheduling functions).A scheduling complex is similar in functionality to a COGINE, both controlling a subset of the larger picture while being cognizant of the behavior of its neighboring schedulers.Overseeing all the COGINEs at the airport is the Central Nexus, with one deployed at each airport.The Central Nexus assembles all the strategic and tactical plans compiled at the airport (although an implementation time frame is not defined at this time) and can share these plans with external entities.In this setting, the Nexus can act as an information router-broker to other ATC systems, such as those deployed in the terminal and en route domains.Another duty of the Central Nexus is keeping all COGINEs informed of the working playbook and future configuration changes, which can modify and constrain many calculation parameters.The example in figure I.3 shows three layers of command and control for the DFW airport employing the DISSEMINATE concept.At the top level is the Central Nexus, which communicates with the COGINE-APenv and all other non-environmental COGINEs.In this example, the environmental COGINEs (third layer) report to the airport's overall environmental computation engine (COGINE-APenv).Depending on the airport's layout and proximity to nearby residences, there may not be a need for the individual environmental COGINEs, which can be replaced with one COGINE-APenv that communicates directly with the Central Nexus.In figure I.3, the environmental COGINEs cover the area beyond the airport property, and can be made to represent and capture the noise footprint in the surrounding neighborhoods.DISSEMINATE presents a distributed framework that can be used to address the complex surface optimization problem.There are many ways to implement this framework, and it is not the intent of the author to specify an implementation method.In one deployment scenario, the framework can be viewed as running 18 instances of SMS, albeit with data-sharing capability that does not currently exists.The other extreme solution may involve a single SMS that can provide the desired solution, given enough computational power.For the remainder of this white paper, the author has elected to use a hybrid model, which fits somewhere between the two extremes.The hybrid model uses the core SMS capability (database management, flight plan processing, estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculation, communications, etc.) along with to-be-developed COGINEs.The model employs one SMS using distributed COGINEs to devise a solution.In this manner, the SMS functions as the Central Nexus of the hybrid system.A comparison of three architectural designs is shown in table I.1.It assumes the use of the SMS version with the plug-in module capability (version 8.2).The plug-in modules will play a pivotal role in the development of COGINEs (essentially extending the plug-in module with more data-sharing capability between modules and the Central Nexus to become a COGINE).Notionally, start by using the SMS as a seminal engine for DISSEMINATE (table I.1, Option A).Option A behaves like the current-day SMS system, with one instance providing coverage over the entire airport.Option B denotes four SMS instantiations that provide coverage over the same airport domain.In this example, the SMS will need an added feature to promote the data sharing between the systems.One SMS will become the Central Nexus or hub to coordinate the other systems.Next, the primary usage of each SMS is identified.Its functionality is ascertained; is it to behave primarily as a scheduler, optimizer, conflict detection and resolution alert mechanism, conformance monitor, or an environmental impact calculator.There might be other roles that it can assume.Option C shows the transformation of Option B into a DISSEMINATE system by transforming one SMS into a Central Nexus (functionally), while distilling the functions of the other three SMS systems into multiple COGINEs.For example, once identified, the primary and secondary utility of each SMS (non Central Nexus) is distilled into core functionality.Next, ancillary and nonessential components are stripped away from the SMS.In essence, the distilled SMS represents the computational engine or COGINE in the DISSEMINATE framework.The main SMS (which becomes the Central Nexus) resumes coordination role over the COGINEs.Alas, each COGINE will be configured to govern a subset of the airport domain.In this distributed network, each COGINE strives to solve local problems while keeping situational awareness by exchanging data with adjacent COGINEs and the Central Nexus (table I.1, Option C).The author has selected the hybrid model because it exploits current architectural improvements in SMS.More specifically, the plug-in architecture provides the key technology to transforming SMS into a distributed system.The functionality of the plug-in module defines the characteristic of the COGINE.
Table I.1: Illustration of Three Architectural Design OptionsOption A: Centralized Architecture Option A: Centralized Architecture This centralized architecture uses one instance of SMS (SMS-1) to provide flow control over the entire Airport Domain.It is hypothesized that this approach will get bogged down as more and more constraining parameters are levied upon the system.The system footprint is small, requiring just one SMS deployment.A short list of features is shown for the SMS-1 model.Note: The green hash marks denote the same airport domain that all three models provide coverage over.Besides being able to use multiple instantiations of the same module, the COGINE may call variations of similarly developed components.For example under the Taxi Optimizer type, there may exist a first-come, first-served (FCFS), mixed-integer linear programming, and a heuristic model.Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the COGINE intends to leverage the strengths of each model as the condition arises.The combination of using multiple instances and application of similarly typed components offers much flexibility for the COGINE.As various plugins or components get developed for SMS, they will become available to the COGINE too.As alluded to in table I.1, Option C, the selection and creation of the COGINE requires a balance between art and engineering.Many factors can affect the forging of the engine, such as primary and secondary functions, computational ability, geographical layout, logical layout, and ATC ownership jurisdiction, just to name a few.
Central Nexus and COGINE Nexus (CoNex)Conceptually, the COGINE framework allows for flexibility and robustness because each COGINE is designed to work independently of one other.This allows for some clever implementations of the COGINEs, but it does demand some coordination and control over multiple COGINEs.Potential problems arise when COGINEs' output conflict with one another (either with value or timing of data).Because of possible conflicting information and messaging, the Central Nexus needs to keep accurate account of all COGINEs (via its CoNex) and their functional characteristics.The Central Nexus is designed to perform multiple functions.It acts as a gateway between the intranet and Internet, relays and routes data between CoNexes, imposes communication protocols standards between COGINEs, maintains a master database of traffic, and provides data logging.The last two items, database maintenance and data logging, currently exists within SMS; the other features are new.For example, the Central Nexus may need to set a control horizon that may be different from the working horizons implemented by each COGINE.Suppose the scheduler in COGINE-X works on a 90-minute horizon and another scheduler in COGINE-K works on a 60-minute horizon.The Central Nexus may need to set a working horizon of 45 minutes, which may force the COGINEs to publish only traffic within the 45 minutes.Yet, the COGINEs are free to work within their desired horizon settings.Functionally, the CoNex behaves very much like the Central Nexus.Its purpose is to route data and set operational protocols between the computational modules, just like the Central Nexus.What CoNex lacks are higher level features like formulation of the larger picture based on data from adjacent DSTs and Central Nexus.From a simplistic view, the software framework developed for the Central Nexus can be trimmed down to become a CoNex.
POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF DISSEMINATEThe flexible and robust assemblage of building blocks offers many ways to formulate an approach to address a problem.This section offers sample applications of the DISSEMINATE framework with judicious use of COGINEs.The examples include settings for flexible sectorization, modeling of Metroplex airspace, and machine-human transfer modes.These are some of the perceived benefits that such a flexible model can offer.
Sectorization OptionsAs stated in the prior section, the COGINE framework can provide different ways to assemble calculation components to implement a solution.Designing the COGINEs requires a balance between art and science.The COGINEs in figure I.3 are placed abutting each other in plan view.However, one can extrude the two-dimensional (2-D) area into a three-dimensional (3-D) volume, such that the COGINE can include an altitude parameter, as illustrated in the side view shown in figure I.9.From this perspective, the COGINE can represent a typical airspace sector.This bodes well for the environmental COGINEs, which model the airspace further out and may include the descent and climb phases of flight.Using a 3-D model, one can design a stratified sector to build appropriate COGINEs to control traffic.One possible use for this configuration is sectorization, the combining and de-combining of sectors to manage demand and workload, reflecting changing traffic levels.Similar stratification modeling can be made to the environmental COGINE-Env#s as well.The size of the environmental COGINE can shrink and grow, or additional COGINEs can be added depending on time of day and season.The flexible sectorization capability may be too complicated for the operator to handle, so automation may be necessary to advise the user of when to take advantage of this capability.In another scenario, COGINEs L, R, and T can all be active.In this case, COGINE-T can function as a conformance monitoring system or even a conflict detection and resolution unit.Thus, COGINE-T is providing additional coverage for COGINEs L and R, or it can be configured to behave as an engine that uses coarser fidelity but with a farther-out prediction horizon.
Metroplex ModelingThe modular architecture can offer an approach to model the Metroplex airspace.Two example applications of the DISSEMINATE framework are presented in the figures below.
Automation-Human Handoff, Mitigation Plan, and Migration TrainingMachine-human control migration mode refers to the transfer of control from decision support tool (DST) or automation back to the human operator.The operational assumption is that in the mid-to far-term time frame, automation deployment will be more widespread than it is today.Automation has made its way into daily operational use and is conducting the majority of the air traffic management.But for any number of reasons, the human operator may need to intervene and resume some of the tasks from the automation.DISSEMINATE may offer some assistance with the transition process and provide a possible mitigation plan to ensure a successful transition.The scenario becomes more important in the NextGen time frame when traffic is expected to double.DSTs are being built to be more efficient in handling the increased traffic.A major shortcoming of such an efficient and automated system occurs when something goes awry and requires human intervention.Regardless of the source, the end result may require placing the human operator back into the control loop.Many research groups have identified this point as an area of concern and one that needs further study.A major disturbance on the surface in a highly congested but efficient system can ripple many hundreds of miles upstream and downstream of the airport.In short, the migration plan involves systematic substitution of the human controller into the control loop.The systematic migration of control may be more feasible with a distributed system such as DISSEMINATE than with a monolithic system.Figure I.12 illustrates an example where COGINE-C and COGINE-EFar are being replaced with human controllers.System inefficiency will be felt during the transition period, but it is expected to be less impactful then bringing the entire system down and substituting all DST controls with human controllers, because the remaining COGINEs can still operate within the new situation but in the degraded mode.The concept involves placing more restrictions upon adjacent COGINEs to give the human operator a chance to assess the situation, and develop and implement a control plan.The traffic management unit (TMU) or equivalent will make systemic requirement changes while the controller works to clear out the sector congestion.Referring to figure I.12, say Controller-C takes the place of COGINE-C.Throughput to and from Controller-C will be reduced.This will impact the handoffs between Controller-C with COGINE-A, COGINE-E, COGINE-ENear, and possibly COGINE-D.In turn, the TMC may restrict flows from COGINE-WNear and COGINE-EFar to Controller-C.In addition, COGINE-EFar is also being replaced with Controller-EFar.Thus COGINE-ENear may take on additional constraints from Controller-C and Controller-EFar.Training can help controllers be proficient in making the transition.DISSEMINATE can also help with the training process.During low-traffic periods, selected COGINEs can be deactivated so the human controller can take command.Again, more restriction will be imposed on adjacent COGINEs to protect the operator, but this should not be an issue during off-peak periods.Ideally, a DISSEMINATE simulator can be set up to run in a simulated environment where training can occur with more intensity.The simulator can aid both controllers and traffic management coordinators by designing and selecting COGINE activations.Figure 1 :1Figure 1: Generic airport surface layout........................................................................................

Figure I. 22Figure I.2 shows a sample deployment of multiple COGINEs at DFW.This figure shows the use of ten COGINEs covering the various movement areas on the airport.But as shown in figure I.3, the complete system contains 17 COGINEs, the ten in figure I.2 plus seven environmental pieces (COGINE-#env), as well as the Central Nexus component.COGINEs A through F handle the traffic around the gate terminals.COGINE-WNear and COGINE-WFar handle ground traffic on the west side, near and away from the terminals.Likewise, COGINE-ENear and COGINE-EFar serve the airport's east-side traffic.The coverage area is selected to reflect current-day and possible future expansion operations.For example, the duties of gate assignment are controlled by the airlines today, but in the future, that task may be relinquished to automation.COGINEs A-F may fill that role, playing the roles of gate pushback scheduler, or even ramp-side conflict detection.The COGINEs in figure I.2 collaborate to provide optimized advisories for arrivals and departures.The notional COGINEs can perform multiple functions (such as taxiing route planner, schedulers, planners, and conflict detection components) depending on their configuration.In addition to the ten COGINEs supporting surface management, the other seven COGINEs in figure I.3 work to provide additional constraints, integration, and dispersion of information to all collaborating COGINEs.The tasks of the COGINE-#env's are to examine environmental impact using modeling, determine limitations and restrictions of usage, and provide guidance to the optimization COGINEs.Coordination of the environmental COGINEs is the task of the airport environmental engine (COGINE-APenv; fig.I.3).

Figure I. 5 :5Figure I.5: Sample COGINE with constituent modules.
The COGINE's selection of components defines the unique role of its functionality.Selection and priorities can be assigned to each component.For example in figure I.6, the environmental COGINE (say COGINE-WNenv) de-emphasizes (semitransparent/grayed out) the conflict detection, scheduler, conformance monitoring, and the taxi optimizer components.The situation is different for COGINEs providing support near the terminal areas (COGINE-A through -F) and runways (COGINE-xFar and -xNear).The COGINEs, Central Nexus, and conceptual data-sharing scheme (publish-subscribe) are presented in figure I.6.
Figure I. 77Figure I.7 depicts a data exchange framework within the COGINE, which is very similar to the DISSEMINATE layout in figure I.6.Similar to the Central Nexus, each COGINE will have a COGINE Nexus (CoNex) to provide coordination of intra-and inter-COGINE communications.The CoNex can operate as gateways to other CoNexes (COGINEs) as well as the Central Nexus.The framework allows decoupling of the design of the COGINE to that of the Central Nexus.However, the communication mechanism is very applicable for both model layers.The intent again is to provide flexibility for intra-COGINE as well as inter-COGINE connectivity.The DISSEMINATE model in figure I.6 uses a sample publish-subscribe mechanism to promote inter-COGINE communication.The publish-subscribe model was chosen for McTMA because of its flexibility to connect a multiple metering-complex, which is similar in concept to the COGINE.
Figure I.7 highlights the importance of including the appropriate adaptation data set needed to define each COGINE.Along with the computational components, the adaptation set defines the domain of control.Figure I.2 and I.3 show the creation of COGINE with consideration to geographical, logical, and ATC jurisdiction factors.

Figure I. 7 :7Figure I.7: Communication model between Central Nexus and COGINE Nexus (CoNex).
Figure I. 88illustrates the connectivity options of the Central Nexus.The diagram shows both intranet and Internet clients.In the Internet example, other Central Nexus may represent a Metroplex environment, and connectivity with other DST can represent interaction with the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA), Traffic Flow Management, or Separation Assurance tools.Of note, the term Internet is used to represent the extended network beyond that of the Central Nexus' network, for an operational system; it may connect to the FAA's secured System Wide Information Management (SWIM) network.The Central Nexus may aid collaboration between COGINEs by defining collaborative protocols, setting common planning and controlling horizons, and activating and deactivating COGINE signals due to change in operational conditions.
Figure I. 8 :8Figure I.8: Central Nexus interfaces between intranet and Internet clients.
Figure I.9 depicts COGINE-T controlling the airspace above COGINEs L and R. On the surface, having an altitude component doesn't make much sense.Instead, think of COGINE-T as an overlay over the other two components that can supplement or supersede the tasks of COGINEs L and R during low-traffic hours.All COGINEs can be configured in advance and invoked when the situation demands it.The switch over between different COGINEs can be configured through the Central Nexus.In less congested times, the Central Nexus can idle COGINEs L and R, and route similar decision-making activities to COGINE-T and vice-versa if necessary.This framework can conceivably support dynamic activation of COGINEs, which requires preconfigured setups and coordination between the CoNex and Central Nexus.The inactive COGINEs can be left inactive or shut down completely to recoup needed resources.

Figure I.10 shows the deployment of three DISSEMINATE systems, representing the Bay Area Metroplex with the San Francisco (SFO), Oakland (OAK), and San Jose (SJC) airports.The three systems exchange data via their representative Central Nexus.
Figure I. 1111Figure I.11 uses a single Nexus to coordinate with the CoNexes of each respective airport.The figure depicts a larger Central Nexus size than the one in figure I.10, to signify the larger role it plays in coordinating with the CoNexes.Each airport is expected to deploy similar, but differently configured, COGINEs and is depicted using different color patterns.The strengths and weaknesses of each design have not been scrutinize at this time, although at first look, figure I.10 may offer more autonomy and robustness due to the use of three independent Central Nexuses.Figure I.11 may have a single point of failure, but may offer more collaboration between parties.Besides, having redundancy may offset the single point of failure choke point.

APPENDIX B: SYSTEM STARTUP DETAILSThe Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) simulations were conducted at the NASA Ames FutureFlight Central (FFC) airport tower simulator facility.The SARDA simulator consisted of two major software components, the Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG) and the Surface Management System (SMS).The Air Traffic Message Translation Engine (ATMTE), a component of ATG, acts as a middleware or translation component between the two systems.In summary, ATG's role is to provide the SMS system with simulated radar targets, and provide a platform to host pseudo-pilots, who enter aircraft-control commands to comply with controller's given instructions.The SMS system takes in aircraft track information and provides controllers with aircraft scheduling and sequencing advisories.The controllers then relay aircraft movement instructions to the pseudo-pilots via voice communications.The SARDA simulations used a mixed of automation and pseudo-pilots (in HILT mode) to control aircraft during each run.The automation controlled all aircraft on the west side of DFW, arrivals, departures, and bridge crossing.For the east side, automation controlled aircraft within the terminal ramps (for terminals A, C, and E), east-to-west terminal bridge crossing, airborne traffic (on final for arrivals, and after wheels up for departures), and ground taxi (awaiting) to cross 17C and 17L.The April HITL simulations used the command file named "SARDA_baseline.sect".For completeness, the sample file is included at the end of this section.Automation also controlled the departures from gates and moved aircraft to the spots.The pseudopilot then took control of flights at the spots until the departure runways.After cleared for departure, the pseudo-pilot handed off the aircraft to the automation system, which then removed the aircraft from the simulation, about 15 nm downstream.Arrivals were automated starting 10 nm out from threshold.After starting the scenario, automation handed off control of the aircraft to the pseudo-pilots, who then determined the runway exit location for runway 17C arrivals.For arrivals on runway 17L, automation determined exit points and taxi route toward runway 17C.The automation handed off aircraft control to the pseudo-pilot after it landed on runway 17C.The pseudo-pilot initiated handoff to automation after taxiing the aircraft to the spot; automation then controlled the aircraft to the gate.

Matlab Script FilesListed here are two Matlab files used to create the Type 3 scenario files.The MASTER_Type3 script calls the ScenarioGeneratorType3 script to create the scenario files.MASTER_Type3.m
APPENDIX G: ATG SCENARIO FILES FOR APRIL 2010 SIMULATIONSThis section lists the actual scenario files used during the April 2010 data collection runs.Four scenario files were generated for the test, consisting of two Normal and two High traffic characteristics.For each scenario file, three other 'alias' files were created by substituting only the aircraft call signs with ones that looked similar; all other aspects of the aircraft characteristics stayed the same.The idea was to present test subjects with more perceived variation in traffic.All other files spawned from these four profiles.The Airspace Traffic Generator (ATG) scenario files are generated using a text file format and various tabbed fields (column headers).However, aircraft are defined according to each row in the file.The column headers are defined slightly differently depending upon different starting conditions-airborne or on the airport surface.The definitions for both types of starting points are defined below.(NOTE: The single text line has been broken up into two lines here for legibility.)
Flights Activated En Route or AirborneRules: This will be Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) for all flights.Status: Airborne (en route) activated aircraft are assigned status RTE (route), typically for arrivals.
Call Sign:The flight identifier for the scenario.Aircraft Type: Identifier used to retrieve the aircraft performance data in ATG.The file, 'aircraft_types_database' is where this data is stored.
Speed:The flight's airspeed upon activation.
Altitude:The assigned altitude for the flight, either upon activation (RTE), or after airborne (GRD).
Start Time:The time at which the flight will appear on the ATG Ground Pilot Station (defined in seconds after start of scenario file and not ATG system start-up time).Sector ID: Sector ownership of aircraft.This can be used to force automation, or determine default pseudo-pilot ownership of aircraft during initialization.A valid sector identification (ID) must be present in the following files before it will be accepted by ATG: sector_names and ground_sectors
Initial Point:The starting location for the flight when it enters the system.This can be a gate, spot, intersection on the surface of the airport, or any airborne position specified by a heading and radial distance from some point (usually a runway).
Destination Airport:The airport assigned to the flight for arrival.
Runway:The runway assigned to the flight for either departure or arrival.
Flight Plan:The route assigned to the flight that specifies how it will reach its destination.Gate/Spot: Self explanatory.Beacon: A four-digit unique transponder code for the flight.This can be left blank.
Flights Activated on the SurfaceRules: This will be Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) for all flights.Status: Aircraft activated on the ground is assigned GRD, typically for departures.
Call Sign:The flight identifier for the scenario.Aircraft Type: Identifier used to retrieve the aircraft performance data in ATG.The file 'aircraft_types_database' is where this data is stored.Speed: The flight's filed airspeed after it becomes airborne.Altitude: The flight's filed altitude after becoming airborne.
Start Time:The time at which the flight will appear on the ATG Ground Pilot Station (defined in seconds after start of scenario file and not ATG system start-up time).Sector ID: Sector ownership of aircraft.This can be used to force automation, or determine default pseudo-pilot ownership of aircraft during initialization.A valid sector ID must be present in the following files before it will be accepted by ATG: sector_names and ground_sectors
Initial Point:The starting location for the flight when it enters the system.This can be a gate, spot, intersection on the surface of the airport, or any airborne position specified by a heading and radial distance from some point (usually a runway).
Destination Airport:The airport assigned to the flight for arrival.
Runway:The runway assigned to the flight for either departure or arrival.
Origin Airport:The airport of origin for the flight (DFW for departures).
Flight Plan:The route assigned to the flight that specifies how it will reach its destination.
Orientation:The initial heading for any flight activated on the surface of the airport.Gate/Spot: Self explanatory.Beacon: A four-digit unique transponder code for the flight.This can be left blank.
APPENDIX H: HUMAN FACTORS QUESTIONNAIRESThe following set of questionnaires was administered to the controller and pseudo-pilot subjects during the April-May 2010 data collection runs at the FutureFlight Central (FFC) facility.
Controller Workload QuestionnaireThe following questions were answered on a laptop computer immediately after each trial in the Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) experiment.Questions were answered by clicking a mouse along a non-numbered horizontal scale from low (left anchor) to high (right anchor).1. How much mental activity was required in the last run (e.g., thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)?2. How much physical activity (e.g., use of radios, keyboard, mouse, etc.) was required during this run?3. How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals of the task during this run?4. How hard did you have to work (mentally and physically) to accomplish this level of success?5. How frustrated were you during this run?6. How much time pressure did you feel due to the pace of events during the run?Was the pace slow and leisurely or rapid and frantic?
Controller Subjective Situation Awareness QuestionnaireThe following questions were answered on a laptop computer immediately after each trial in the SARDA experiment.Questions were answered using a 1-4 scale (1= very difficult/very poor, 4 = very easy/very well).Please rate your ability to identify the information you needed to control traffic during this run.The following questions were answered on a laptop computer immediately after each trial in the SARDA experiment.Which questions were asked depended on the role (i.e., ground/local) played by the controller during that trial.Questions were answered using keyboard text entries.All questions were scored as either correct or incorrect.Scoring criteria (e.g., when a range/ approximation rather than an exact value was considered correct) are included in parentheses after each question.5. How far out is your last departure (could include "on runway" or "off scope," in addition to mile estimate)?6. How much farther does your last departure need to travel before the next one can be released?7. Is the runway clear for a departure?8. How many arrivals are holding short of 17R?Pseudo-Pilot Workload Questionnaire Questions 1-6 were answered on a printed sheet immediately after each trial in the SARDA experiment.Questions were answered by circling a number on a 7-point scale (1 = low, 7 = high).Question 7 was answered by filling in a percentage value for each sub-question.1. How much mental activity was required in the last run (e.g., thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)?2. How much physical activity (e.g., use of radios, keyboard, mouse, etc.) was required during this run?3. How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals of the task during this run?4. How hard did you have to work (mentally and physically) to accomplish this level of success?5. How frustrated were you during this run?6. How much time pressure did you feel due to the pace of events during the run?Was the pace slow and leisurely or rapid and frantic?
