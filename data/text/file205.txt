IntroductionFuture air traffic demands are expected to require a greater degree of integration among the automation systems used to manage arrival, departure and surface traffic.The next generation air transportation system (NextGen) envisions Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface (IADS) operations as described in the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) Integrated Work Plan [38] and in the FAA's NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations [35].Various NextGen concepts [28,31,32] describe IADS operations that feature a greater degree of automated coordination as traffic flows from one control domain to the next in the tactical air traffic control environment.A logical step towards the NextGen vision of fully-integrated arrival/departure/surface operations is to automate tactical scheduling of departure traffic that will join a constrained en route traffic flow.A commonly used tactical Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) is the Call For Release (CFR) procedure, which is also known as the Approval Request (APREQ) procedure.CFR procedures vary from facility to facility; however, they generally require the Air Traffic Control Tower (i.e., Tower) to request approval from the Air Route Traffic Control Center (i.e., Center) prior to releasing departures destined to specified airports.Earlier research [20,21] at NASA Ames focused on automating inter-facility coordination during CFR procedures.An FAA-led effort built on this work to develop and evaluate the Departure Flow Management prototype [13].Presently, en route tactical departure scheduling to meet CFR restrictions is often accomplished with the TMA decision support tool.Tactical departure scheduling with TMA is thoroughly described in Section 3 of the PDRC ConOps [1].The PDRC concept combines the automated coordination demonstrated in the previous research [13,20,21] with the use of surface trajectorybased takeoff (OFF) time predictions and departure runway assignments to improve en route tactical departure scheduling with TMA during CFR procedures.The PDRC research activity is an element of the Systems Analysis Integration and Evaluation (SAIE) Project of NASA's Airspace Systems Program.The Aviation Systems Division at NASA Ames Research Center is conducting the PDRC research activity based out of NTX.This research activity is also being accomplished using NASA Research Announcement contract (NNA11AC17C), which was awarded on 23 Sep 2011.Mosaic ATM, Inc. is the prime contractor for this work and CSC and Veracity Engineering are subcontractors.This document is a joint effort between NASA and contractor personnel.NASA and the FAA are coordinating NextGen technology transfer via Research Transition Teams (RTTs).The RTTs have defined Research Transition Products (RTPs), consisting of distinct concept and/or technology elements that can be transferred as a package.PDRC is one of four RTPs currently being coordinated by the IADS RTT.NASA delivered an initial PDRC RTP package to the FAA in July 2012.Formal delivery of the core PDRC RTP package is slated for the summer of 2013.This final report will be one element of the PDRC RTP package.The FAA has identified the Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) Program and the Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) Program as recipients of the PDRC RTP.The research presented in this paper was conducted at NASA's North Texas Research Station (NTX) and associated FAA air traffic control facilities in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.Consequently, the examples and discussions in this paper primarily focus on the north Texas air traffic environment.Every effort has been made to ensure that the research results are applicable throughout the National Airspace System.This final report provides an overview of the research activity and presents field evaluation results.Companion documents describe the concept of operations [1] and the technology development [2].Effectively, these three documents comprise a three-volume report and the reader is urged to have all three papers at hand.Section 2 of this report provides an overview of present-day tactical departure scheduling operations and summarizes an analysis of shortfalls conducted at the outset of the PDRC research activity.Section 3 provides an overview of the PDRC concept and shows how PDRC technology may be applied to existing tactical departure scheduling operations.Section 4 surveys the technology developed under this research activity.Section 5 describes the setup used for the PDRC field evaluations.Section 6 presents field evaluation observations and findings.Section 7 provides a preview of PDRC follow-on research.Finally, concluding remarks are offered in Section 8.
Tactical departure scheduling characteristics and shortfallsThis section presents an overview of present-day tactical departure scheduling operations and summarizes results of a shortfalls analysis.This material was originally published in two 2011 AIAA conference papers [4,5] and is discussed in much greater detail in the PDRC Concept of Operations [1].
2.1Tactical departure scheduling Tactical departure scheduling is a process used by TMCs and FLMs to regulate air traffic flow to eliminate local demand/capacity imbalances and adhere to local traffic management initiatives (TMIs).Tactical departure scheduling is not required during normal NAS operations, as the airspace into which a flight is being released generally has sufficient capacity to accommodate the departure.However, during periods of high demand or low capacity for the airspace being scheduled into, tactical departure scheduling may be utilized.Tactical and strategic departure scheduling processes are distinct from one another and are currently not directly integrated.Tactical departure scheduling is distinguished from strategic departure scheduling based upon scope (both temporal and geographic), precision requirements, and the decision support tools used.Strategic departure scheduling primarily uses the Traffic Flow Management (TFM) tool suite, while tactical departure scheduling is typically accomplished with the TMA decision support tool.Please consult References 1 and 5 for a more complete discussion of the differences between tactical and strategic departure scheduling.It has been helpful to categorize tactical departure scheduling operations as either inbound or outbound depending on the TMA function used for scheduling.These scenarios are thoroughly discussed in Section 3.3 of the PDRC ConOps [1].A brief overview will be provided here.Figure 2:1 illustrates both scenarios for traffic in Fort Worth Center (ZFW).The blue arrows show various traffic streams inbound to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH).These streams pass through ZFW airspace and converge at the TORNN meter arc.The green arrows depict a cross-country, overhead traffic stream outbound to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL).DFW departures (broad gold arrows) seeking to join these streams must be merged with the en route traffic at meter points shown in red near the ZFW boundary.The IAH stream is categorized as inbound because tactical departure scheduling is performed with the arrival-focused "internal departure" scheduling functions in the TMA system performing metering for IAH arrivals.This TMA system is "owned" by Houston Center (ZHU), although ZFW controllers perform some of the metering and ZFW TMCs can interact with the system.The ATL stream shown in Figure 2:1 is categorized as outbound because tactical departure scheduling is performed with the En Route Departure Capability (EDC) functions in the ZFW TMA system.In either scenario, ZFW TMCs use TMA tactical departure scheduling functions to compute CFR times for DFW departures seeking to join the constrained en route streams.The scheduling process and coordination between ZFW TMCs and DFW Tower personnel is described in Section 3.3 of the PDRC ConOps [1].
Present-day system characteristics and shortfallsThe PDRC research activity characterized present-day tactical departure scheduling operations and identified shortfalls in the current system.This analysis is detailed in Reference 5 and the results are summarized in this section.Reference 5 examines operational TMA and EDC data from all NAS facilities where the tools were deployed.The data included 1,082,000 flights operating during January 2011.The analysis indicates that these TMA and EDC tactical departure scheduling capabilities are widely used in the NAS today with over 65,000 scheduled aircraft per month using these methods.Increased utilization of tactical departure scheduling decision support tools has been fueled by expansion of adjacent center metering and nation-wide deployment of the EDC capability.The PDRC ConOps [1] summarizes this analysis in a Venn diagram that has been excerpted in Appendix A (Figure 9:1) for easy reference.This diagram highlights the finding that tactical departure scheduling is used 3.5 times more often than strategic departure scheduling.The Venn diagram also shows that the inbound scenario described above occurs 5 times more often than the outbound scenario.Although tactical departure scheduling with TMA and EDC has become a widely used component in NAS operations today and represents a significant improvement over the previous process, which lacked trajectory-based ascent modeling, analysis of the current system performance indicates that significant room for improvement exists by reducing departure time uncertainty.Based upon operational data analysis described in Reference 5, 6,792 inbound tactically scheduled aircraft and 1,911 outbound tactically scheduled aircraft in January 2011 NAS-wide are estimated to have missed the airspace slot they were scheduled into, due to departure time prediction uncertainty.Missed scheduled departure slots often lead directly to lost NAS capacity, most notably in the case in which an aircraft is scheduled frozen into an arrival TMA slot but does not meet its expected departure time window.Reference 5 proposes metrics measuring missed overhead stream slots; however, measuring the impact to the NAS of a missed departure slot is not always straightforward as some ability to recover the airspace resources exists, often at the cost of additional TMC or controller workload and/or inefficient flight paths.Before concluding this discussion of present-day operations, note one highlight of an additional finding from Reference 5.The aforementioned Venn diagram (Figure 9:1) notes that "1 in 4 arrival metered flights is a tactical departure."Stated another way, this means that 25% of inbound flights metered by an arrival TMA system are scheduled (i.e., have slots reserved) in the overhead stream while they are still on the surface at the origination airport.The 25% figure is a NAS-wide average.For some facilities nearly half of their TMA metered arrivals are scheduled as tactical departures.This is primarily due to the fact that TMA's adjacent center metering capability has greatly extended the scheduling time horizon.TMA development is continuing under the FAA's Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) program.The TBFM program office is introducing new concepts designed at further extending the range of arrival metering.This increased range will be achieved through use of new concepts such as 'Coupled Scheduling' [25] and 'Extended Metering.'TBFM estimates of the maximum nominal metering range of an 'Extended Metering' system are approximately 725 nmi.As has been demonstrated with TBFM's adjacent center metering systems, when the metering geometry expands, more airports enter the metering system from the airport surface (i.e., tactical departure scheduling).Due to the emerging demand for tactical departure scheduling and the significant uncertainty these flights represent to the en route schedule, the future need for integrating surface information into departure scheduling is expected to increase as well.
Concept and research prototype overviewNASA has developed the PDRC concept to address the shortfalls in present-day tactical departure scheduling operations.This section provides an overview of the PDRC concept and shows how PDRC technology may be applied to existing tactical departure scheduling operations.The companion ConOps document [1] provides additional details on this concept.
3.1Concept overview Figure 3:1 provides a high-level overview of the PDRC operational concept.This figure is applicable to both the outbound and inbound tactical departure scheduling situations described above.The right side of the figure depicts departure traffic operating under the CFR procedure where departures must be merged into constrained en route traffic flows.The left side of the figure shows the PDRC decision support tools used for tactical departure scheduling.The upper portion of the figure depicts a traffic stream in the en route domain that is under a CFR constraint.PDRC builds on an existing tactical departure scheduling decision support tool used by the Center to schedule departures into this constrained overhead stream.Ascent modeling in the en route decision support tool enables precise time-based scheduling and deconfliction at the meter point.The modeled ascent trajectory is illustrated by the gold line in Figure 3:1.The lower portion of Figure 3:1 depicts the Tower environment where a NextGen surface trajectory-based decision support tool is in use.NextGen surface trajectory-based operations are enabled by a surface surveillance system and air carrier data sharing that provides intent and status information (e.g., gate assignments, estimated and actual pushback times).The surface trajectories computed and used by this decision support tool are represented by the blue and red lines in this figure.PDRC focuses on the automated communication and use of surface trajectory-based OFF time predictions and runway assignments for tactical departure scheduling in CFR situations.In present-day operations, OFF time prediction and communication is manual.Automated PDRC communication is illustrated by the double-headed arrow on the left side of Figure 3:1.The Center decision support tool uses surface trajectory-based OFF time predictions for departure scheduling and coordinates release times with the Tower surface trajectory-based decision support tool.The Tower tool predicts OFF times and runway assignments for use by the Center tool in tactical departure scheduling and coordinates release times with the Center decision tool.The focal point for PDRC is the OFF event in Figure 3:1 where the red trajectory joins with the gold trajectory on the departure runway.The Tower decision support tool computes surface trajectories to this point to develop OFF time estimates.The Center decision support tool computes airborne trajectories from the surface specified runway to the merge point in the overhead stream for tactical departure scheduling.
PDRC research prototype implementation overviewAs discussed above, the PDRC concept calls for integrating the Center's tactical departure scheduling system with a surface decision support tool capable of providing trajectory-based OFF time predictions and departure runway assignments.Figure 3:2 illustrates the PDRC concept applied to present-day tactical departure scheduling operations.The PDRC prototype uses a Research TMA (rTMA) system derived from operational FAA TMA software for Center tactical departure scheduling.The Surface Decision Support System (SDSS) serves as a surrogate for a NextGen trajectory-based surface management system.These and other elements of the PDRC prototype are described in Section 4 and in the companion Technology Description document [2].The upper portion of Figure 3:2 illustrates present-day tactical departure scheduling operations for both the inbound and outbound scenarios described in Section 2.1.The tactical departure trajectory is shown in gold and merges with the constrained overhead flow at a meter point shown in red.The departure airport is on the left located inside the departure Center shown in blue.The arrival airport is on the right located inside the arrival Center shown in green.The constrained overhead stream is shown flowing from left to right from the blue Center to the green Center where the stream becomes an arrival flow to the airport on the right side of the figure.Two separate TMA systems are depicted by the timeline user interface icons with "Center DST" labels.The TMA icons have a color-coded borders to depict which Center "owns" which TMA system.Consider first the outbound tactical departure scenario.In this case traffic managers at the blue Center would use the blue TMA/EDC system to schedule CFR departures from the airport on the left into the constrained overhead stream.The traffic managers are using their own TMA/EDC system to schedule traffic outbound from their own Center.In this case, the constrained overhead flow happens to be an arrival stream for an airport in the adjacent Center, but it is treated like any other outbound flow for scheduling purposes.Now consider the inbound tactical departure scenario.In this case, the departure from the airport on the left (in the blue Center) is scheduled into the green TMA system, which is being used by the green Center to meter the arrival stream to the airport on the right.The CFR call and tactical departure scheduling action is most likely being performed by traffic managers in the blue Center using an interface to the green Center TMA system.Thus, the blue Center traffic managers are using the green Center TMA system to schedule traffic inbound to the airport on the right.The lower portion of Figure 3:2 shows PDRC applied to tactical departure scheduling operations.PDRC's double-headed arrows connect a trajectory-based surface system at the departure airport to inbound and outbound TMA systems.The PDRC concept and technology have been developed for both the inbound and outbound tactical departure scheduling scenarios.In Section 2.2 it was noted that FAA TBFM program Adjacent Center Metering developments have significantly extended the reach of TMA arrival metering.Future TBFM developments in the areas of Coupled Scheduling and Extended Metering are expected to further extend the TMA arrival metering scheduling horizon.One can visualize this in terms of Figure 3:2 by imagining a much longer double-headed arrow connected to the green arrival metering TMA system thereby extending the reach of tactical departure scheduling.
Technology developmentThis section presents a survey of PDRC prototype technology development to highlight some of the more important accomplishments.Complete details regarding the PDRC prototype software are provided in the Technology Description companion document [2].
4.1Overview As described in Section 3, the PDRC concept integrates an en route tactical departure scheduling decision support tool (DST) with a NextGen surface trajectory-based DST.OFF time predictions and departure runway predictions from the surface tool are provided to the en route tool to improve departure scheduling calculations.The concept also facilitates coordination between Center and Tower TMCs/FLMs via the digital interface between the DSTs.Design decisions for the PDRC prototype were driven by two primary considerations: (1) minimize technology transfer barriers, and (2) maximize the likelihood that FAA TMCs/FLMs would be willing to use the prototype during operational field evaluations.Both of these considerations weighed heavily in the decision to develop a research version of FAA TMA (i.e., rTMA) rather than use NASA's in-house TMA prototype (i.e., the Center TRACON Automation System or CTAS).The extra effort required to develop rTMA has paid dividends many times over both in technology transfer coordination and in TMC/FLM acceptance of the PDRC prototype.Use of rTMA also reduced the training required and enabled the team to take advantage of unexpected field evaluation opportunities involving unusual traffic configurations that likely would not have been adapted in a CTAS-based PDRC prototype.The decision to use SDSS for the Tower tool was made for similar reasons.Although SDSS is not operationally deployed, it is used for research and development by various FAA organizations.This provides a common frame of reference for technology transfer coordination.Additionally, SDSS has benefitted from many years of NASA/FAA joint development, which has produced features and overall system robustness that helped the PDRC prototype system win acceptance with Tower TMCs/FLMs.Figure 4:1 depicts a survey of PDRC technology development.This is a marked-up version of Figure 3:4 from the PDRC Technology Description [2].A clean copy of this figure is provided in Appendix A (Figure 9:2) for easy reference.These figures are organized into three main sections according to the software systems being depicted.The left side of the diagram (in green) shows processes associated with SDSS.The right side of the diagram (in blue) shows software processes associated with rTMA.There are actually two rTMA systems shown on the right side of the diagram.The upper right portion of the diagram shows the rTMA system used for the outbound tactical departure scheduling scenario.This rTMA was configured as ZFW TMA/EDC.The lower right portion of the diagram shows the rTMA system used for the inbound tactical departure scheduling scenario.This rTMA was configured as ZHU arrival metering TMA.
Double-headed arrowThe signature piece of PDRC technology is the "double-headed arrow" of Figure 3:1 that represents two-way communications between the surface and en route components of the system.Two callout boxes in Figure 4:1 are labeled "double-headed arrow" and point to the software processes that enabled this new, two-way communications interface.On the SDSS (left/green) side a new TMA Connect process was created to handle all communications with TMA.On the rTMA (right/blue) side a new surface data interface (SDIF) process was created to receive data from SDSS.TMA's existing Collaborative Arrival Planner (CAP) data-sharing interface was extended to send data to SDSS.
4.3All flights all tracks Early in the PDRC prototype development process it was determined that it would be necessary for the en route and surface components to operate from a single, authoritative set of flight plan and airborne surveillance track data.The simplest solution was to have rTMA provide airborne flight plan and surveillance data to SDSS via the existing CAP interface.However, unlike NASA's CTAS prototype system, flight plan and track data is compartmentalized in the FAA's TMA system.The "all flights all tracks" callout on the rTMA (right/blue) side of Figure 4:1 denotes changes that were made to the rTMA input source manager (ISM) process to enable the full set of airborne flight plan and surveillance data to be delivered to SDSS.
4.4Scheduler modifications PDRC leverages existing TMA departure scheduling functionality.SDSS-computed Predicted Coordinated Off Time (PCOT) and Undelayed Coordinated Off Time (UCOT) values are delivered to rTMA via the double-headed arrow interface for use in scheduling by the dynamic planner (DP) and meter point dynamic planner (MPDP) processes.Both the UCOT and PCOT times were necessary so that rTMA could give credit to flights that encountered surface delays.This reduces the chance that a flight might be double-penalized by both a surface delay and a tactical departure delay.The "scheduler modifications" callout on the rTMA (right/blue) side of Figure 4:1 indicates that changes were required to the DP/MPDP and the departure scheduling user interface on the timeline graphical user interface (TGUI) process to enable automatic use of these SDSS-predicted OFF times.
4.5Departure routing The "departure routing" callout on the rTMA (right/blue) side of Figure 4:1 denotes improvements that were made to rTMA airborne departure routing within TRACON airspace.These improvements are particularly noteworthy because they were made possible by SDSS departure runway predictions communicated to rTMA via the PDRC double-headed arrow technology.The improvements were implemented via changes to the adaptation files used by rTMA's route analyzer (RA) and trajectory synthesizer (TS) processes.A description of these changes and the supporting analysis is provided in Appendix B (Section 10) of this paper.The Appendix B analysis shows TRACON flight time prediction errors have been reduced by up to a factor of 6 (i.e., average errors of 176 seconds reduced to 28 seconds) depending on the departure runway and departure fix combination.This analysis was conducted for the DFW North Flow configuration and a single southern departure fix (DARTZ) because this departure route was used frequently in the PDRC operational evaluations.However, the implemented solution provides TRACON flight time prediction improvements for all flows and departure fixes, and the error reduction will be comparable for flows and fixes with similar geometries.
OFF time prediction improvementsThe "OFF time prediction improvements" callout on the SDSS (left/green) side of Figure 4:1 points to the SDSS Surface Model process and highlights numerous changes that have been implemented to improve SDSS OFF time predictions.Some of these changes were introduced when SDSS was up-leveled to version 9.x, which featured a redesigned Surface Model.The v9.x SDSS model includes additional instrumentation (e.g., the TrajectoryDashboard-1.0tool) to support data collection and analysis.Section II-E of the 2012 AIAA paper [6] identifies Aircraft Movement Area (AMA) taxi time predictions as a major contributor to OFF time prediction uncertainty.The paper recommends pursuing a more sophisticated model for AMA taxi operations.Appendix C (Section 11) of this paper describes the multivariate regression analysis that was conducted using outputs of the new TrajectoryDashboard tool mentioned above.Appendix C (Section 11) also addresses SDSS implementation details.
4.7Air carrier two-way interface The "air carrier two-way interface" callout on the SDSS (left/green) side of Figure 4:1 denotes the new two-way, Tactical Surface Data Exchange (TSDE) interface with American Airlines that was implemented to improve SDSS OUT time predictions and to capture actual OUT events for data analysis.This interface was developed in collaboration with the FAA's Surface Trajectory Based Operations (STBO) Project.
Multi-domain 'what if' schedulerThe "multi-domain 'what if' scheduler" callout on the SDSS (left/green) side of Figure 4:1 points to the completely new TMA Scheduler process that was developed specifically to support PDRC research.The SDSS TMA Scheduler process collects internal rTMA scheduling information and makes it available to Tower TMCs/FLMs for 'what-if' analyses and better visibility into the en route portion of the tactical departure scheduling problem.This multidomain scheduler performs the specified hypothetical scheduling tasks (e.g., 'what if' scheduling) and presents the results to the user.This new process supports the enhanced scheduling capabilities research that is briefly discussed in Section 7.2 of this paper.
4.9Multi-airport, many-to-many interface architecture The "multi-airport, many-to-many interface architecture" callout on the SDSS (left/green) side of Figure 4:1 denotes a capability developed in PDRC that allows the surface system to connect to multiple en route systems for PDRC data exchange.The end state integration of PDRC capability in the NAS envisions many-to-many connections from/to surface and en route systems.Planned PDRC follow-on research addresses more complex scheduling constraints (e.g., TRACON-level flow constraints) and lesser-equipped airports.The TRACON Departure Scheduling research activity, briefly discussed in Section 7.3 of this paper, will build on the multi-airport, many-to-many capabilities developed in PDRC.This completes the survey of PDRC technology development.Please consult the Technology Description document [2] for a more detailed description of the technology associated with PDRC.
Field evaluation setupThree PDRC field evaluations have been conducted at NASA's North Texas Research Station (NTX) field site.A live-data, operational environment shadow evaluation was conducted in July 2011 [4].This was followed by two operational evaluations (Block 1 & 2) conducted in the summer of 2012 and the winter of 2012/2013.The Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations were essentially a single operational evaluation with a built-in pause to allow for interim data analysis and system enhancements.Since the evaluation setup was generally similar in all three cases it will be described here to avoid repetition in the analysis and results sections that follow.As is typical for Centers, the ZFW TMU is physically separate from the specialties where sector controllers work.The TMU is staffed by TMCs and Supervisory TMCs (i.e., STMCs) and only these personnel interacted with the PDRC prototype system.NASA personnel provided PDRC prototype training for all ZFW TMCs and STMCs -approximately 30 individuals.Most of the TMU staff participated in both Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations.
Physical layout
DFW TowersThis location corresponds to the Tower role in the PDRC operational scenario described in Section 6 of the PDRC Concept of Operations [1].PDRC user interfaces are installed at the TMC desks at both East and West Towers at DFW.The inset image in the upper right portion of Figure 5:1 shows the East Tower PDRC installation.The West Tower installation is similar.The TMU functions in the Tower are much less segregated than they are in the Center.Consequently, all Tower personnel were involved in the PDRC field test, some directly and others indirectly.The direct involvement was managed by Tower TMCs who are part of the
AA DFW Ramp TowerThe PDRC user interface at American Airlines' DFW Ramp Tower is shown in the top left corner of in of Figure 5:1.This position was established for the July 2011 shadow evaluation to gain a better understanding of the available air carrier data and to experiment with it through manual data entry into the PDRC system.In essence, the NASA observer at this position acted as a surrogate for the TSDE data interface mentioned in Section 4.7 and detailed in the companion Technology Description document [2].American Airlines continues to provide valuable data and support for the PDRC research activity.
NTX LaboratoryThe NTX Laboratory shown in the lower right corner of Figure 5:1 served as the command center for the Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations just as it did for the July 2011 shadow evaluation [4].Due to the target-of-opportunity nature of the operational evaluations, services provided by the NTX lab had to be virtualized and automated to a greater extent than for the shadow evaluation to support the agile evaluation methodology described below.
ApparatusThe primary apparatus for the Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations was the PDRC prototype system itself.Complete details are provided in the companion Technology Description document [2] and can be summarized as follows:• rTMA decision support tool including GUI clients (typically 3 per system)• SDSS decision support tool including GUI clients (typically 4 per system)• Live data feeds for rTMA and SDSS including Center, TRACON, and ASDE-X surveillance, Rapid Refresh forecast winds aloft, and air carrier data • PDRC two-way interface connecting rTMA and SDSS For the Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations, the PDRC prototype system was hosted on a dedicated Linux server configured with two 2.5 GHz quad-core CPUs and 48GB RAM.Each PDRC server ran all of the rTMA and SDSS computational processes hosted on one virtual machine (VM) with a second VM hosting the associated rTMA and SDSS GUI clients, and services for distributing the GUI clients to remote user displays.The PDRC Block 1 & 2 operational evaluation depended upon a number of NTX-built research support systems.One of the most important is the NextGen Emulation System (NEXUS) desktop distribution system, which uses a graphical desktop sharing utility (i.e., Virtual Network Computing) to distribute all PDRC GUI clients to the various end-user display machines.The NEXUS desktop distribution system also provides for digital video recording of all displays for post-test review.The PDRC research team also used the NTX-developed Terminal Area Radio Telecast System (TARTS) and TowerCam systems to support Block 1 & 2 operational evaluation data collection.TARTS provides streaming audio of controller/pilot radio transmissions received over-the-air at the NTX laboratory.TowerCam consists of remote control pan/tilt/zoom cameras mounted on DFW's central Tower.
5.3Agile and opportunistic evaluation methodology A key observation from the July 2011 shadow evaluation experience [4] was the need for an agile and opportunistic evaluation methodology for the operational tests that were to follow.Tactical departure scheduling situations are dependent on unpredictable weather and traffic volume factors making it necessary for the research team to adopt a target-of-opportunity mentality towards data collection.Since data collection "runs" could not be scheduled in advance, the team could not count on having research observers on position to collect data.Likewise, it was simply impractical to have a small, dedicated cadre of TMCs/FLMs to work with the research team as was done in past NASA operational evaluations.Even without considering cost, it was concluded that it would be logistically impossible to have the participation of research observers on position and a small cadre of TMCs/FLMs for the entire evaluation.Consequently, the PDRC research team developed an agile and opportunistic data collection system to partially compensate for the target-of-opportunity evaluation challenges noted above.A key aspect of this system involved immediate notification via email and text message when a tactical departure scheduling opportunity arose.Upon receiving this notification, PDRC evaluation team members coordinated with each other via email and/or text message to identify who would monitor the system.The designated system monitor would be ready to offer assistance should the TMCs require technical support and the monitor ensured that research data was collected.The PDRC prototype systems are, of course, fully instrumented.Every input and output and a wide array of internal parameters are recorded and archived.Additional instrumentation is provided by the NEXUS desktop distribution system (Section 5.2), which enables research observers to remotely monitor and analyze TMC/FLM interactions with PDRC.This "video replay" capability has proven to be immensely valuable for filling gaps when an observer was unable to monitor the CFR event live and for following up on TMC/FLM feedback.The target-of-opportunity evaluation methodology is highly dependent on participant training.Since a dedicated cadre was not an option, the PDRC team trained more than 30 ZFW TMCs/STMCs on use of the PDRC prototype over the course of the research activity.This challenging task was made manageable thanks to the decision to use rTMA for the en route portion of PDRC.Since rTMA was derived directly from a recent version of FAA TMA, nearly all features and functions are the same.This allowed the trainers to focus just on PDRC-specific features.NASA was also fortunate to have several ZFW TMCs/STMCs assist with training their colleagues.NASA personnel provided PDRC prototype training for all DFW TMCs and STMCs.DFW Tower participation in the July 2011 shadow evaluation and the Block 1 operational evaluation was limited to TMCs and STMCs.For the Block 2 operational evaluation, the DFW Tower FLMs were included in the group of evaluation participants.DFW TMCs conducted the training for the FLMs.DFW STMCs also developed briefings on PDRC operational evaluation procedures and delivered these to all DFW Tower controllers.Gathering feedback from TMCs/FLMs as they used PDRC was a primary evaluation objective.This task was particularly challenging with no on-position observers and without the luxury of dedicated debriefing sessions with a controller cadre.The PDRC team compensated for these shortcomings by creating several avenues for TMC/FLM feedback:• Electronic feedback forms accessible directly from PDRC user interfaces • NTX technical support hotline • Periodic "how goes it" meetings TMC/FLM feedback will be examined more thoroughly in Section 6.4
5.4Inbound scenario field evaluation challenges Section 2.2 summarized research conducted in 2011 that examined shortfalls in present-day tactical departure scheduling operations.This research identified a large benefits pool for improved tactical departure scheduling and showed that the majority of the potential benefits are associated with the inbound scenario.Additionally, it is expected that FAA TBFM developments will continue increasing inbound usage at the expense of outbound usage.One can easily envision a future where the outbound scenario no longer exists.These factors made the inbound scenario an enticing target for PDRC field evaluations.However, the very factors that make the inbound scenario more interesting also make it more difficult to evaluate.The inbound scenario involves TMA arrival metering, which operates in a closed-loop mode (i.e., meter times displayed on sector controllers' radar scopes).In contrast, the outbound scenario utilizes the TMA/EDC function which, in current practice, operates in open-loop mode.TMCs in the TMU use TMA/EDC to provide the sector controllers with a workable traffic situation, but sector controllers are not required to meet TMA/EDC meter times.The closed-loop operation of TMA arrival metering requires a two-way interface to the Center Host or ERAM computer so that meter times can be delivered to the sector controller scopes.Even though rTMA is derived directly from FAA TMA it is still a research system and has not been approved for two-way Host or ERAM interface.An additional complication is illustrated in Figure 3:2, which shows that the inbound scenario requires the rTMA portion of PDRC to be deployed at the arrival Center.Consequently, the field evaluation threshold is much higher for the inbound scenario with TMA arrival metering.This threshold difference may cause one to question the value of evaluating only the outbound scenario, but there are two main reasons for doing so.First, as shown in Figure 3:2, the surface portion of the evaluation is virtually identical between the inbound and outbound cases.This is particularly true for the common case of DFW-to-IAH tactical departures scheduling, which sometimes operates inbound and sometimes outbound.During the Block 1 field evaluation there were numerous occasions where the Tower TMCs attempted to use PDRC for an inbound IAH scenario because they didn't have visibility into which scenario was in play -it all looked the same from the Tower side.Thus, all research on the surface component of PDRC applies equally to the outbound and inbound cases and the outbound scenario is satisfactory for evaluating any enhancements or extensions made on the surface side.Second, although there are distinct differences between the scenarios on the Center side, the TMC role is very similar between the two scenarios.
Field evaluation observations and findingsThis section presents observations and findings, quantitative and qualitative, collected during the PDRC shadow and operational evaluations.
Evaluation overviewsThe brief overviews for each of the PDRC evaluations provide the necessary background for the observations and findings presented in subsequent sections.The overviews document the number of tactical departures that were scheduled with the PDRC prototype.For a flight to count as a PDRC-scheduled flight, both the Tower and Center TMCs/FLMs had to schedule the flight using the PDRC system and the scheduling procedure described in Section 6.1 of Reference 1.A summary of the PDRC scheduling procedure is provided in Appendix A (Figure 9:3) for easy reference.
July 2011 shadow evaluationThe July 2011 shadow evaluation has been thoroughly documented in Reference 4, so only a brief summary will be given in this paper.As previously noted, this was primarily a training and shakedown evaluation session.NASA observers were stationed at operational positions at ZFW and the DFW East Tower to provide training and technical support and to record observations and feedback as TMCs operated the system in shadow mode.The NASA observer at American Airlines DFW ramp tower was tasked with transferring updated OUT estimates from AA systems to the PDRC prototype (in lieu of the not-yet-implemented TSDE interface) and recording observations from that unique perspective.Notably, this was the only evaluation where PDRC was operated in the inbound scenario (see discussion in Section 5.4).TMCs provided feedback on PDRC performance (shadow mode only) in this scenario, and the evaluation team explored potential workarounds for inbound scenario operational evaluations.None proved satisfactory.On the final day of the evaluation the test shifted from shadow to operational mode wherein the PDRC prototype system was used to schedule five actual DFW departures using the outbound scenario.13 weeks of continuous target-of-opportunity evaluations Participants:
Block 1 operational evaluationZFW and DFW TMCs/STMCs Flight count: 120 operational departures scheduled in the outbound scenario Objectives:• Validate the PDRC concept • Demonstrate PDRC prototype system performance • Identify and quantify sources of uncertainty in the tactical departure scheduling process Key changes since July 2011 shadow evaluation are summarized below.See the Technology Description document [2] for complete details.• The PDRC surface component (i.e., SDSS) was upgraded to version 9.x, which features an improved trajectory-based airport surface model.The improved model provides better OFF time predictions and has additional instrumentation to support data collection and analysis.• The PDRC en route component (i.e., rTMA) was re-derived from FAA TMA version 3.12.Also, rTMA now has the ability to use departure runway from SDSS to improve airborne route models.• A new two-way TSDE interface with American Airlines was implemented to improve SDSS OUT time predictions and to capture actual OUT events for data analysis.This interface was developed in collaboration with the FAA's STBO Project and is discussed in Section 4.7.Data from the Block 1 evaluation are collected in Appendix D (Section 12).Table 12:3 provides a count of PDRC-scheduled flights by date and destination airport.This table shows that the two Houston-area airports (IAH and HOU) accounted for about 78% of the flights scheduled with PDRC during the Block 1 evaluation.Twenty-seven feedback forms were received during the Block 1 evaluation.These are discussed in Section 6.4.TMC feedback was also gathered at team "how goes it" meetings on May 14, May 31, and June 11.Clarity of communications during CFR coordination was a major topic of discussion at the initial Block 1 "how goes it" meetings.See Section 6.2 for a discussion of findings on this topic.
Block 2 operational evaluationKey changes since the Block 1 evaluation are as follows:• Merged with latest SDSS baseline (v9.2.x) to leverage FAA investments.• New adaptation logic to improve taxi time predictions.• Completely new SDSS software to enable Tower display of overhead stream slot information.• User interface changes (e.g., colors, layout) to address TMC feedback.• New "go/no go" status panel to improve TMC coordination.• rTMA improvement to correct a scheduling anomaly.Data from the Block 2 evaluation are collected in Appendix E (Section 13).Table 13:3 provides a count of PDRC-scheduled flights by date and destination airport.This table shows that the two Houston-area airports (IAH and HOU) still account for the majority of PDRC flights; however Denver (DEN) now ranks 2 nd with 22 PDRC-scheduled flights while it had none in the Block 1 evaluation.The increase in CFR instances for DEN may be related to increased use of Optimized Profile Descent (OPD) arrival procedures at that airport.DFW traffic management experts report early indications that increased arrival stream compression apparently associated with OPDs is resulting in more frequent and extensive restrictions at airports with more OPD arrivals like DEN.It should also be noted that the Block 2 operational evaluation had about 83% more (24 vs. 14) west-side departures than the Block 1 evaluation and virtually all DEN flights would depart on the west side of DFW.More analysis is required to verify a correlation between DEN OPD arrival operations and DFW-to-DEN CFR frequency.For the 16 week Block 2 evaluation, the PDRC prototype was estimated to have operated in CFR mode for approximately 150 hours.This estimate was made possible by the new CFR two-way status indication system (i.e., "thumbs up/down" indicator) described in Section 6.4 of Reference 2. Logging features built into the status indicator record when both facilities have selected a "thumbs up" status.The total "two thumbs up" time for Block 2 amounted to a little more than 150 hours over the 16 week evaluation period.Twenty-three feedback forms were received during the Block 2 evaluation, discussed in Section 6.4.TMC feedback was also gathered at team "how goes it" meetings on Dec 18 and Feb 14.
March 2013 shadow evaluationLive traffic shadowing sessions and storyboard-driven structured interviews were used to obtain early feedback on PDRC enhanced scheduling concepts from a focus group of four ZFW and DFW subject-matter experts.See Section 7.2 for a discussion of this research thread.
Communication uncertaintyA key finding from the July 2011 PDRC shadow evaluation [4] was that there may be varying interpretations and practices regarding the actual target release time within the CFR compliance window.Consequently, the PDRC research team worked with ZFW and DFW TMCs to reduce this source of uncertainty for the operational evaluations.The diagram shown in Figure 6:1 was developed to facilitate communication between the researchers and TMCs regarding CFR time.This diagram was used during test preparation and training for the Block 1 operational evaluation.The bottom portion of Figure 6:1 provides a pictorial representation of key events for a departing flight.The upper portion shows these same events mapped to a timeline similar to those displayed on the rTMA and SDSS decision support tools used for PDRC.The left side of the timeline shows these events from the human (i.e., TMC) perspective while the right side of the timeline shows them from the PDRC software system perspective.The discussion that follows will center on four events depicted in Figure 6:1.Considering the events chronologically, the first is "Cleared for T/O," which is simply the time at which the Tower Local controller issues the takeoff clearance.At this point control over the actual departure time is ceded to the pilot.The next significant event is "Start of Roll," which will occur at some variable interval after the takeoff clearance.The "Start of Roll" variability is due to a combination of human factors and aircraft characteristics.The next key event is "Wheels OFF," which is the time at which an onboard weight-on-wheels switch would indicate that the aircraft is airborne.The interval between "Start of Roll" and "Wheels OFF" is almost entirely a function of aircraft takeoff weight and performance characteristics.The final event of interest is labeled "Tagged Up."This corresponds to the time at which the departing flight is acquired by the TRACON surveillance radar and "tags up" on the radar scope.In communications with flight crews, Tower personnel often use "wheels in the well" (i.e., landing gear fully retracted) as a useful approximation for the "Tagged Up" event.Uncertainty in CFR communications begins with varying interpretations and/or assumptions concerning the four key events described in the preceding paragraph and shown in Figure 6:1.Achieving higher precision in tactical departure scheduling requires that the Tower and Center TMCs/FLMs and their software tools all be on the same page when exchanging information about these events.The SDSS predicted surface trajectory (i.e., the red trajectory in Figure 3:1) ends at the runway threshold at the "Start of Roll" event.The rTMA software uses "Wheels OFF" as the starting point for airborne trajectory computations (i.e., the gold trajectory in Figure 3:1).PDRC software provides an adjustable "Roll Buffer" parameter to compensate for the difference between the "Start of Roll" and "Wheels OFF" events thereby connecting the red and gold trajectories of Figure 3:1.On the human side of the Figure 6:1 timeline, Center TMCs primarily focus on the "Wheels OFF" event because this is the starting point of the airborne trajectory computed by their TMA tool.TMA requires an "aircraft ready time" to be entered via the departure scheduling user interface.This ready time is the predicted "Wheels OFF" time.Without PDRC, the "aircraft ready time" is manually estimated by the Tower TMC/FLM and verbally communicated to the Center TMC for entry into TMA/EDC.With PDRC, the "aircraft ready time" estimate is automatically set to the current SDSS OFF time prediction.See Section 6.2.4 of the ConOps [1] for a detailed description of this portion of the PDRC scheduling process.Tower TMCs/FLMs simultaneously consider multiple events on the Discussions with Tower TMCs led to an important finding that influenced the PDRC software design.Specifically, it was found that the Tower was aiming for "Tagged Up" instead of "Wheels OFF" in meeting the release times coordinated with the Center.Although the Center and Tower TMCs appear to have been operating with different definitions for Coordinated Release Times, the discrepancy was not large enough to impact Baseline CFR operations.Data collected during the Block 1 evaluation show the "Tagged Up" event is, on average, 25 seconds later than the observed "Wheels OFF" time.This 25-second difference only became significant with the push for higher precision during the PDRC operational evaluations.The PDRC software easily accommodates the different Coordinated Release Time definitions with the "CFR Buffer" parameter shown in the Figure 6:1.This buffer allowed the Center and Tower TMCs/FLMs to continue using their standard CFR procedures.Note that the value of the "CFR Buffer" parameter may be different from one facility to the next.A more significant source of uncertainty involves the use of Coordinated Release Time windows and verbal communication of the start/stop times for those windows.In present-day (i.e., non-PDRC) CFR operations, the Coordinated Release Time is communicated verbally over facility inter-phone from the Center to the Tower.A recent FAA Notice [39] has amended the FAA 7110.65 standing order to establish standard compliance window dimensions.The Notice states "when CFR is in effect, release aircraft so they are airborne within a window that extends from 2 minutes prior and ends 1 minute after the assigned time, unless otherwise coordinated."This standardized window is consistent with the -2/+1 window that was observed in use at ZFW and DFW during non-PDRC operations.The new order does not specify phraseology for communicating the time window.Use of a Coordinated Release Time window automatically introduces release time uncertainty equivalent to the size of the window.However, observations and interviews with Center and Tower TMCs revealed even more uncertainty than expected associated with use of windows.To begin with, the -2/+1 window is often, in practice, a 3 minute 59 second window due to frequent inclusion of the termination minute in the window itself.Also, variations in the phraseology used to verbally communicate window start/stop times that contributed to CFR uncertainty were observed.
6.3Characterizing CFR scheduling operations at DFW A significant event of interest for tactical departure scheduling is when (and where) the scheduling decision is being made.Previous observations have shown that the CFR scheduling decision is often made at or near the spot, but there is significant variability in the timing of this scheduling decision.Performance goals for the Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations were for PDRC-enabled tactical departure scheduling to conform to present-day standard operating procedures and meet or exceed the performance of manual tactical departure scheduling.In other words, TMCs were not asked to make the CFR scheduling decision any earlier than they would without PDRC.Before a detailed discussion of the evaluation results, it will be helpful to characterize CFR scheduling operations for the Baseline, Block 1, and Block 2 data sets.DFW International Airport is distinguished by two operational Towers and a centrally-located terminal complex served by a north/south freeway (International Parkway) that bisects the airport property.Consequently, DFW is often characterized as two airports in very close proximity.The east-side "airport" has a control tower and four runways.The west-side airport has a control tower and three runways.The east and west sides are linked by four bridges (a pair to the north and a pair to the south) that carry taxiways over International Parkway.DFW primarily operates in either south flow or north flow runway configuration.Thus, it is helpful to sort DFW CFR scheduling operations into four categories: east side vs. west side and south flow vs. north flow.Table 6:2 shows the distribution of Baseline, Block 1, and Block 2 departures amongst these four categories.Note that the data presented in this section correspond to the sets used for the OFF time compliance comparisons of Section 6.5.This plot represents one year (Nov 2010 -Oct 2011) of tactical departure scheduling operations at DFW.  Researcher observations, supported by reports from Tower TMCs/FLMs, indicated that CFR scheduling decisions at DFW are typically made at or near the Apron Entry/Exit Point (AEP) or "spot."To reduce clutter, the spots have not been depicted in these figures, but they are located along the outer edges of the aprons where the darker gray of the apron touches the lighter gray of the taxiways.For flights departing on the opposite side from their parking gate, the CFR decision is usually made as they cross the bridge (i.e., taxiways A, B, Y, and Z).The data presented in Figure 6:2 and Figure 6:3 generally confirm these expectations.The Baseline data in Figure 6:2 clearly has a higher percentage of scheduling events on the hold pads near the departure thresholds than does Figure 6:3.One might be tempted to conclude that CFR scheduling was performed later in the Baseline case than with PDRC; however, this difference is more likely attributable to the data source differences described in the previous paragraph.Further analysis is required to determine if there was any real difference in the CFR scheduling decision point between the Baseline and PDRC cases.These results lead to a consideration of the temporal characteristics of the CFR scheduling process.The third and fourth columns in Table 6:3 characterize the delta time between the Tower RFRT and the Center completion of the CFR scheduling action with rTMA/EDC.This is an important metric for tools designed to facilitate CFR coordination.A lower time indicates a faster response by the Center TMC to the scheduling request.The Center CFR scheduling will normally occur some finite delta time after the Tower RFRT.The zero minimum values reflect seven flights (six for Block 1 and 1 for Block 2) where PDRC scheduling was initiated by the Center -in these cases there was no Tower request.As one might expect, as the operational evaluation continued and the TMCs gained familiarity with the PDRC prototype, the Center response time improved and also became more consistent.The PDRC concept and prototype builds on previous CFR/APREQ coordination research [13,20,21] and takes the next step by automatically providing surface trajectory-based OFF time and departure runway predictions.Since the value of automated CFR/APREQ coordination had already been demonstrated in field evaluation [13], the PDRC team elected not to collect additional quantitative baseline data on the manual CFR coordination process at DFW and ZFW.The previous section (Section 6.2) examined the impact of verbal communications uncertainty on CFR coordination.The last three columns in Table 6:3 show lead time between the completion of the CFR scheduling process and the actual OFF event.This is likely the best metric for comparing CFR scheduling decisions between the Baseline and PDRC cases.The minimum, mean, and median values are all quite comparable between the three cases.The maximum value PDRC Block 2 is about 19 minutes (i.e., 80%) earlier than the maximum value for the Baseline.Before drawing conclusions based upon this difference one must understand that the Baseline data set has been culled to remove OFF time compliance (OTC) outliers beyond one and one-half the interquartile range (i.e., 1.5 x IQR).The Baseline data set culling process is described in Section 6.5.These OTC outliers are the ones most likely to have earlier CFR scheduling decisions.Consequently, the data presented here lead to the conclusion that the CFR scheduling decision point was very similar between the Baseline and PDRC cases.This finding is consistent with expectations since pre-evaluation training stressed that TMCs were not to push for earlier CFR scheduling decisions.
Subject-matter expert feedbackThe subject-matter experts for these evaluations were TMCs, STMCs, and FLMs who used the PDRC prototype while conducting CFR operations at DFW and ZFW.For brevity these test participants will be referred to as TMCs throughout this section.As discussed earlier (Section 5.3), these target-of-opportunity evaluations presented particular challenges to acquiring TMC feedback.Consider that 238 flights were scheduled with PDRC during 29 weeks of Block 1 & 2 evaluations -an average of 8 data points per week on a highly variable schedule.Additionally, more than 40% of these PDRC scheduling events occurred outside of regular work hours (before 8:00am, after 6:00pm, or on weekends).Consequently the PDRC team developed alternative mechanisms for acquiring TMC feedback.These included the NTX technical support hotline, periodic "how goes it" meetings, personal interactions with researchers, and electronic, web-style feedback forms accessible directly from PDRC user interfaces.This section primarily focuses on data collected via the electronic feedback forms.Screenshots of the electronic feedback forms are shown in Appendix A (Section 9). Figure 9:4 shows the Tower form and Figure 9:5 shows the Center form.These feedback forms were designed to facilitate systematic data collection while keeping the reporting burden as low as possible.The latter point is particularly important as TMCs were being asked to voluntarily provide feedback while conducting tactical departure scheduling operations -by definition a very busy time at their positions.To facilitate communications and promote use of the feedback form mechanism, TMCs were encouraged to use the forms to report any and all feedback and not just ratings.Consequently, only a portion of the submitted forms contained quantitative user feedback for eligible PDRC-scheduled flights.
Identifying eligible ratingsTable 6:4 summarizes all of the feedback forms received during the PDRC operational evaluations.The left half of the table summarizes feedback received for Block 1 and the right half summarizes Block 2. The far left column shows designators for each of the TMCs that submitted feedback.The far right column shows the total number for forms submitted by each TMC.The overall totals are shown on the bottom row -twenty-seven forms were submitted during Block 1 and twenty-three during Block 2 for an overall total of fifty forms.The second line in the Table 6:4 heading shows that feedback forms were sorted into two categories: those with numeric ratings and those without (i.e., forms reporting PDRC issues).The third line of the Table 6:4 heading shows that the feedback was further categorized by whether or not the submitted form applied to a PDRC-scheduled flight.Fourteen different TMC identifiers are listed in the far left column of Table 6:4.Two of these (DFW5 and ZFW8) represent three forms received from unknown TMCs (i.e., there were no identifiers on the form).Seven feedback forms (five for Block 1 and two for Block 2) were submitted for flights that did not meet the PDRC scheduling criteria discussed in Section 6.1.Four of these ratings were for flights that did not depart DFW.The rTMA/EDC component of PDRC at the Center was used for tactical departure scheduling from all airports and not just DFW.This feedback was helpful for understanding rTMA/EDC scheduling performance, but the ratings are not directly applicable to PDRC.Of the three remaining ineligible rating forms, two were submitted in situations when only the Center was using PDRC and one was for a situation where the CFR was cancelled prior to departure.That leaves thirty-one eligible ratings (sixteen for Block 1 and fifteen for Block 2) to discuss in the following sections.Despite some significant PDRC prototype software changes between Blocks 1 & 2, the evaluations were very similar from the TMC's perspective.Thus, the ratings from the two evaluations will be considered together.However, because the Tower and Center forms had different questions they will be discussed separately.1 6 DFW4 1 1 1 DFW5 1 1 1 ZFW1 1 4 4 9 2 1 8 11 20 ZFW2 1 1 1 ZFW3 1 1 1 ZFW4 1 1 1 ZFW5 1 1 1 1 2 ZFW6 1 1 2 2 3 ZFW7 1 1 1 ZFW8 1 1 2 2 ZFW91
DFW ratings and discussionThis section addresses the DFW ratings for the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.The four ratings questions on this form are shown below.The TMCs were asked to rate each question on a 1 (bad) to 5 (good) scale.Please consult the DFW feedback form screenshot (Figure 9:4) for the exact presentation of the rating scale.Q1 Was the initial PDRC OFF time PREDICTION reasonable in this situation?Q2 Was the release time coordinated with ZFW via PDRC acceptable in this situation?Q3 How did PDRC scheduling EFFORT compare to your baseline procedure?Q4 Was the PDRC system HELPFUL in this departure scheduling situation?Five DFW TMCs submitted feedback forms during the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.Table 6:5 shows that three of those five are responsible for the ratings that described below.Each row in the table represents a single feedback form.The four columns on the right correspond to the four questions shown above.Meaningful statistical results cannot be interpreted from such a small sample size; however the average and median ratings for each question are shown to suggest potential trends.Overall, the ratings are very positive.One that deserves more discussion is the January 9 th rating for AAL1919 from DFW2.This particular TMC was highly experienced with the PDRC prototype, and had provided significant valuable feedback throughout the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.The DFW2 feedback prompted an investigation that turned up a lurking software error in SDSS logic that handled coordination of release times with rTMA/EDC.Put simply, the software error would allow coordinated release times to become stale in situations where the Center/Tower scheduling coordination was not promptly completed or where the traffic situation on the surface was very dynamic.The odds of encountering this error were relatively low, and the troubleshooting analysis showed the January 9 th situation to be a near worst-case scenario for this logic flaw.A fix for this error was developed, tested, and deployed on January 23 rd .Note that DFW2 provided a very favorable rating for the PDRC prototype on February 21 st .
ZFW ratings and discussionThis section addresses the ZFW ratings for the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.The four ratings questions on this form are shown below.The TMCs were asked to rate each question on a 1 (bad) to 5 (good) scale.Please consult the ZFW feedback form screenshot (Figure 9:5) for the exact presentation of the rating scale.Q1 Was the PDRC meter point crossing PREDICTION reasonable?Q2 Was the final MERGE into the overhead traffic stream acceptable?Q3 How did PDRC departure scheduling EFFORT compare to baseline TMA? Q4 Was the PDRC system HELPFUL in this departure scheduling situation?Nine ZFW TMCs submitted feedback forms during the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.Table 6:6 shows that seven of those nine are responsible for the ratings described below.As in the previous section, the rows in this table correspond to individual feedback forms and the columns to the four questions shown above.Average and median ratings for each question are provided to suggest potential trends.Note that not every question has been rated on every feedback form.As shown in the feedback form screenshot (Figure 9:5), the form is launched with a default setting of "not rated" for each of the questions.Values of "NR" in Table 6:6 indicate that a TMC elected not to rate that particular question on that form.The TMC had the option to explain the "not rated" in the free-form comments; however, none of these were explained.Overall, the ratings are very positive; however, a couple of the lower-rated flights deserve a closer look.The June 11 th rating for DAL2210 included the following comment: issue was resolved and verified by Center personnel.The improved rTMA software was introduced prior to the beginning of the Block 2 operational evaluation.A/C WASThe July 8th rating for TCF3514 is also worth a closer look.This feedback form included a comment that the overhead stream required a three-minute delay to accommodate this flight.A check of the OFF time compliance shown in Table 12:2 shows actual OFF to be 42 seconds later than the coordinated release time, which is well within the standard -2/+1 compliance window.Analysis of the airborne portion of this flight showed an unusual TRACON flight path that may have contributed to this issue, but there was insufficient data to fully analyze this finding.Finally, it is worth presenting a day during the Block 1 evaluation when no ratings were submitted.Table 12:2 shows that June 18th was a banner day.Nine flights were scheduled with the PDRC prototype system that day and the OFF time compliance values indicate that the system was performing well.ZFW submitted no feedback forms on this date.A DFW TMC (DFW2) did submit one feedback form.However, this feedback contained no ratings or comments directly relating to the PDRC prototype.DFW2 feedback indicated that UAL1407 could not be tagged up (i.e., registered as an identified target) in the surface surveillance system, which prevented this flight from being scheduled with PDRC.This anecdote highlights the challenges of gathering systematic TMC feedback during target-of-opportunity operational evaluations.An old adage claims that no news is good news, but this is not true from a research data collection perspective.However, the fact that the PDRC prototype was used regularly for a total of 29 weeks with positive feedback (provided via a limited number of forms, the five "how goes it" meetings, and through personal interactions with the TMCs and FLMs) is considered a positive finding.
OFF time complianceOne objective of the Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations was to demonstrate system performance in real-world operations.The PDRC concept seeks to improve upon schedule compliance by reducing uncertainty inherent in manually computed ready time estimates and manual coordination of release times.Thus, OFF time compliance is an important system performance metric for PDRC.Preliminary OFF time compliance results comparing Block 1 data to a Baseline data set were reported in Reference 6.The analysis used for that report has been refined and extended to include the Block 2 data.In simplest terms, OFF time compliance (OTC) is the difference between the Coordinated Release Time (CRT) discussed in Section 6.2 and the actual OFF time:
OTC = OFF -CRTNegative OTC values indicate departures that were earlier than the Coordinated Release Time.Values for the Coordinated Release Time are easily obtained for both the Baseline and PDRC cases as they are recorded by the TMA/EDC.The challenging aspects of this analysis are detecting the actual OFF event and determining which flights are valid for OTC comparison purposes.One difference between this analysis and that done for Reference 6 involves the actual OFF time computations for the Baseline data set.The earlier analysis relied on a departure message delivered to TMA/EDC by the Center Host computer.For this analysis, pseudo-OFF times were used as detected from ASDE-X surface surveillance track data by the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool [49].The SODAA-detected pseudo-OFF times are more comparable to the SDSS-detected pseudo-OFF times used for the PDRC data.Both SDSS and SODAA compute a pseudo-OFF time by detecting start of takeoff roll from surface surveillance data.These values are referred to as "pseudo-OFF" instead of "start-of-roll" to be consistent with SDSS and SODAA parameter naming conventions.For PDRC OFF time compliance analyses, an OFF time value is preferred that is as close as possible to the time that would have been recorded by the aircraft weight-on-wheels sensor.Section I-G of Reference 6 examines the uncertainty associated with predicting takeoff roll times.In that analysis takeoff roll times (both mean and median) were found to be 38 seconds with a small standard deviation.Since SODAA's pseudo-OFF time is very close to the start of takeoff roll, a 38-second bias was applied to SODAA pseudo-OFF times to approximate actual OFF for the Baseline data set shown in Table 14:3.SDSS uses a different algorithm than SODAA does, and it produces pseudo-OFF times that are typically 10-20 seconds after the start of takeoff roll.For this analysis visually-determined OFF times were compared with SDSS pseudo-OFF times for all Block 2 PDRC flights and the difference (both mean and median) was found to be 23 seconds with a very small standard deviation.Thus, a 23-second bias was applied to SDSS pseudo-OFF to approximate actual OFF for the Block 1 & 2 data sets shown in Table 12:2 and Table 13:2.Statistical comparison of the times from OFF to first airborne surveillance track was found to be a useful sanity check for the pseudo-OFF bias values.Mean and median OFF-to-first-track times are within 2 seconds between the Block 1 and Block 2 data sets.Comparing Baseline OFF-to-first-track times to those for Block 1 & 2, the means and medians differ by 9-10 seconds.This difference could be reduced by applying a larger bias to the Baseline pseudo-OFF times; however, there is insufficient data to justify a deviation from the 38 seconds average takeoff roll time reported in Reference 6.Armed with near apples-to-apples actual OFF time computations, the valid flights for OTC comparison purposes are considered.This process was relatively straightforward for the Block 1 & 2 data sets.The research team observed all flights scheduled during these evaluations, and thus was able to use firsthand knowledge to determine which flights were valid for OTC comparison purposes.For example, one PDRC-scheduled flight that was subject to a CFR procedure was later expedited in order to prevent potential hail damage.At the point that verbal direction was given to expedite the flight, the CFR time was no longer valid.However, no electronic commands were issued for this flight and, had the team not been aware of this occurrence, this flight would have inappropriately skewed the OTC comparisons.After culling flights where the CFR restriction was explicitly or implicitly removed, any flight subject to a strategic TMI (i.e., flights assigned EDCT times) was removed from the OTC analysis.Flights with EDCTs were not counted in the primary compliance measure because they introduced variation due to procedural differences that were not the focus of this research.Occasionally, individual controllers were observed following different procedures in situations where flights were simultaneously subject to strategic and tactical TMIs.The culling process was more challenging for the Baseline data set since the firsthand observations were not available.This OTC analysis used the same Baseline data set as in Reference 6.This set was obtained from operational TMA/EDC recordings beginning in November 2010 and running through October 2011.This set included 451 DFW departures that were tactically scheduled with ZFW's operational TMA/EDC system.Fifty-two of these flights had assigned EDCT times and were removed from consideration per the rationale given above.This left 399 flights in the Baseline dataset as candidates for the OTC comparison.Use of SODAA for pseudo-OFF detection resulted in 20 additional flights being culled from the Baseline set as these flights did not have the necessary surface surveillance data.A final round of sanity checking removed 8 more flights from the Baseline set because the TMA/EDC scheduling action was deemed to be too close (less than 30 seconds) to the SODAA pseudo-OFF time.This round of culling left 371 flights in the baseline data set.As noted above with the flight expedited due to hail, many events can effectively cancel a CFR without leaving an electronic record.Given that this large sample of Baseline data covered a long duration in which unknown circumstances might have been involved without a PDRC observer to report them, the outliers beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., 1.5xIQR) were removed.This established the outlier cutoffs at +403 seconds and -278 seconds and reduced the baseline data set to 342 flights.The three data sets used in the OTC comparison are presented in Appendices D, E, and F. As noted above the actual OFF times shown in these tables were computed by applying a bias (either 23 seconds or 38 seconds) to the pseudo-OFF times detected by SDSS and SODAA, respectively.Table 6:7 presents descriptive statistics for the OTC comparison.Since OTC can be either negative or positive, the standard deviation and absolute mean were found to be the most meaningful indicators of system performance.The OTC standard deviation for the Block 1 & 2 sets is approximately 43% lower than the standard deviation for the Baseline set.The OTC absolute mean for Block 1 & 2 is about 43% lower than the absolute mean for the Baseline set.Another useful system performance metric is OFF time compliance as commonly measured in present-day NAS operations.In this measure, a flight is said to be compliant if it fits within the standard -2/+1 Coordinated Release Time compliance window [39].This system performance metric is helpful because it simultaneously captures both the real mean error as well as the variation in a readily-visualized manner.The last two rows of  6:4.This data point is 30 seconds beyond the 1.5xIQR cutoff of -166 seconds had the outliers been removed from this data set.However, flights were removed from the Block 1 & 2 OTC analysis only when there was evidence that the CFR had effectively been cancelled or that PDRC scheduling procedures were not being followed.Since this flight departed more than 3 minutes earlier than the PDRC-scheduled release time, it is strongly suspected that the CFR was canceled in this case, but there was insufficient evidence for it to be removed.Since OTC may be either positive (late) or negative (early), it is instructive to consider the absolute OTC in addition to the real OTC.The absolute OTC mean values were presented in Table 6:7 with the other descriptive statistics.Figure 6:5 shows the distribution for the absolute OTC.As expected, Block 1 & 2 both show markedly better performance than the Baseline.Comparing the absolute distributions for Block 1 and Block 2, one can see that Block 1 has about 4% more flights in the 20-second bin while Block 2 has 6% more flights in the 40-second bin and more than 6% more flights in the 60-second bin.Counts for the 80-second bin are comparable.While these results appear to favor Block 1 they really highlight a shortcoming off the absolute value OTC measure.In CFR operations, it is generally better to be early than late because it is easier and more fuel efficient for controllers to slow a flight to fit into a slot than it is to speed one up.The absolute OTC measure treats early and late compliance errors equally.Reviewing Figure 6:4, it can be seen that the Block 2 distribution is generally biased earlier than the Block 2 distribution.This is confirmed by the fact that the Block 2 mean value of -9 seconds is 28 seconds earlier than the Block 1 mean value of 19 seconds.To summarize, PDRC improved tactical departure scheduling performance by reducing the uncertainty the process.The focal point of tactical departure scheduling is the OFF event where the surface trajectory ends and the airborne trajectory begins.This is also the point around which Tower and Center TMCs coordinate release times.Consequently, reducing the OFF time compliance error was a primary objective for PDRC.The OTC descriptive statistics and distributions presented in this section demonstrate that PDRC provides significant improvement over Baseline levels of OFF time compliance.At the beginning of the PDRC research activity it was initially assumed that the flight time predictions provided by the en route scheduling system (i.e., TMA/EDC) were sufficiently accurate to enable tactical departures to 'hit the slot' reserved in the overhead traffic flow.This assumption was based primarily upon the fact that TMA/EDC was operationally deployed to all Centers and had a reputation among subject-matter experts for accurate flight time estimates.As PDRC research progressed, it was discovered that the error associated with the airborne predictions was more significant than initially envisioned.The first indication of this error came during the shortfalls analysis research [5] in which it was discovered that the majority of flights did not hit the slot they were scheduled into even after the first airborne surveillance.This research, which analyzed all TMA/EDC sites across the NAS for the month of January 2011, indicated that over 60% of flights did not hit the slot predicted by arrival TMA after initial airborne (TRACON and/or Center) surveillance.Thus, the portion of 'hit slot' error associated with airborne transit time prediction was significant.The 'hit slot' metric used in the shortfalls analysis [5] revealed a lower percentage of success than expected, however, it did not provide insight into where the error was occurring.By design, the 'hit slot' measure emulated what operational Center TMCs do and thus incorporated uncertainty from the departing flight through all phases of flight up to the meter point crossing.The 'hit slot' metric also incorporates uncertainty associated with predictions for the leading and trailing aircraft in the overhead traffic flow that the tactical departure is being scheduled between (i.e., uncertainties regarding the slot itself).Therefore if the TMA/EDC airborne transit time prediction was exactly correct to the second, but the predictions for the leading or trailing flights that define the slot were not accurate, the tactical departure would not hit its slot.To learn more about these 'hit slot' metric errors, tools were developed to capture and analyze the information needed to isolate airborne flight time prediction errors.First, the airborne flight metrics were divided into TRACON transit time versus Center transit time estimates.This division was logical because the tactical departure encounters very different traffic situations in these two operational environments.That is, TRACON flight time estimates that terminate at the departure fix are rarely affected by merging/conflicting flights, whereas merging and sequencing commonly have a large impact on Center flight time estimates.The TRACON transit time is defined as the duration in seconds from wheels OFF to crossing the departure fix, which resides on the boundary of TRACON/Center airspace.A TRACON transit time analysis showed that significant errors may exist in the predicted horizontal flight profiles used by TMA/EDC to compute ETAs at downstream fixes.Results from this analysis were reported in the 2012 AIAA paper [6], and the complete analysis is presented in Appendix B (Section 10).To briefly summarize, the Appendix B analysis shows large TRACON transit prediction errors due to TMA/EDC's lack of detailed departure routing adaptation within the TRACON.The authors believe that this detailed adaptation was intentionally omitted from TMA/EDC because it depends on knowledge of the specific departure runway.The TMC must manually enter departure runway into the present-day TMA/EDC system.Since this entry is not commonly made, it is logical not to invest in the detailed TRACON departure adaptation that depends on the runway entry.However, with PDRC, the predicted departure runway is automatically and continuously transmitted from the surface system to TMA/EDC.The analysis shows that the PDRC-provided predicted departure runway plus relatively minor TMA/EDC adaptation changes enable significant improvements in TRACON transit time predictions.The results presented in Figure 10:3 show a six-fold reduction in average TRACON transit time prediction error for the largest group of flights affected by this problem.These improvements were incorporated into the PDRC prototype (specifically the rTMA/EDC adaptation) and used for both the Block 1 & 2 operational evaluations.The uncertainty analysis depicted in Figure 6:6 was conducted in parallel with the Block 1 operational evaluation and documented in the 2012 AIAA paper [6].This analysis attempted to quantify uncertainty in all phases of the departure process, including the TRACON and Center transit time prediction errors.For the PDRC scheduled flights in the Block 1 evaluation, the mean absolute error was 25 seconds with a median TRACON transit time error of 21 seconds [6].The mean absolute Center transit time error for all PDRC scheduled flights was 49 seconds with a median error of 32 seconds.Note that the mean error is approximately twice as high for the Center transit time error compared to the TRACON transit time error, despite the fact that the flight distance for these two measures are approximately the same.As noted in Section 5.4, the PDRC operational evaluations have involved only outbound tactical departure scheduling using the TMA/EDC decision support tool.Currently, the FAA operates TMA/EDC in an open-loop mode.Unlike arrival metering with TMA, TMA/EDC schedule times and sequence information are not displayed on sector controllers' radar scopes.Center TMCs use TMA/EDC to manage constrained traffic flows in order to provide sector controllers with a workable traffic situation.Sector controllers solve the traffic puzzle with no knowledge of the TMA/EDC planned solution.This has been a significant factor in the high Center transit flight time errors noted in the PDRC evaluations.Observations of PDRC-scheduled flights and discussions with Center TMCs also revealed other factors, including significant speed fluctuations in the overhead stream, flights that cut corners off of the nominal route, pop-up flights that were scheduled after the PDRC scheduled flights, and altitude error.In the case of altitude error, the primary challenge was that the TMA/EDC predictive models do not reflect the Letter of Agreement between ZFW and ZHU in which aircraft are delivered to ZHU at flight level 290 if IAH is in East flow and flight level 310 if IAH is in West flow.Without this detailed information concerning crossing altitude restrictions, TMA/EDC computes meter point ETAs based on filed flight plan altitudes, which could have significant differences in wind speed and/or take some time to maneuver to.This discussion of airborne transit time prediction errors can be recapped with reference to the PDRC concept overview diagram (Figure 3:1).PDRC research began with the assumption that the TMA/EDC airborne trajectory (shown as gold in the figure) was acceptably accurate and that the primary contribution to tactical departure scheduling would be to provide a more accurate initial time (i.e., T 0 ) for this trajectory.The improved initial time for the airborne trajectory would be courtesy of a more accurate predicted final time (i.e., T F ) for the surface trajectory shown in red -a better OFF time prediction.Reduced uncertainty in OFF times has been demonstrated; however, it has also been discovered that more work is required on the airborne side of the problem.Some contributions in this area have been made by using PDRC technology to give TMA/EDC knowledge of the departure runway.Thus, the PDRC prototype improves both the initial time and the initial location (i.e., spatial origin) for the gold airborne trajectory.However, analysis [6] shows that even these improvements are not enough to suggest use of the airborne 'hit slot' metric proposed in the original shortfalls analysis paper [5].Given the timing associated with widespread deployment of a surface capability that could supply the OFF times required, it is likely better to assume a metering environment in which times are presented to the controllers with tighter tolerances (e.g., ±30 seconds), as has been demonstrated by NASA's Efficient Descent Advisor (EDA) [10].Assuming this environment is available along with OFF times and departure runway assignments provided by surface automation, 'hit slot' measures taken in a field environment are much more likely to yield improved results.
Next stepsThis final report and companion documents [1,2,4,5,6] comprise the PDRC research transition package that NASA will deliver to the FAA to support TFDM and TBFM system acquisition and implementation efforts.This technology transfer will conclude the core PDRC research activity; however, much work remains to be done in the tactical departure scheduling arena.During the course of the PDRC development and evaluation the NASA research team and FAA subjectmatter experts and stakeholders developed several compelling ideas for follow-on research.These ideas generally coalesce into three threads: air carrier collaboration, PDRC Enhanced Scheduling, and TRACON Departure Scheduling.Recommendations for future work in these areas will be discussed in the following sections.
7.1Air carrier collaboration As shown in Section 6.3, CFR scheduling decisions with PDRC are made at or near the Apron Entry/Exit Point (AEP) or spot, consistent with present-day tactical departure scheduling practices.The 2012 paper on prediction uncertainty [6] examined the feasibility of making the CFR scheduling decision earlier (i.e., moving the decision point closer to the gate).The paper concluded that earlier scheduling with PDRC might be feasible; however, it seems likely that active air carrier participation will be required for effective CFR scheduling in the ramp area.Active air carrier participation in the management of departure is currently being studied on many fronts, including the NASA Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) concept [17], the Surface Collaborative Decision Making effort [34], and the Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM) research [8] led by the FAA's STBO project.Throughout the PDRC research activity NASA has collaborated with the FAA's STBO project to further develop the Tactical Surface Data Exchange (TSDE) interface that was discussed in Section 4.7.With support from FAA STBO, a TSDE interface with American Airlines was developed for the PDRC prototype and this interface provided valuable input for Off-Block Time predictions during the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.Although TSDE is specified as a two-way interface, the data flow was one-way (air carrier to PDRC) during the Block 1 & 2 evaluations.In parallel with the evaluations, NASA and FAA STBO continued development of the PDRC-to-air carrier side of the TSDE interface.The next steps for this effort will be to share PDRC data elements with air carrier ATC coordinators to assess the value of this information in the air carrier environment.
7.2PDRC Enhanced Scheduling Section 6.1.4summarized a shadow evaluation conducted in March 2013.This evaluation can be described as a series of focus group sessions that used live-traffic shadowing and storyboards to motivate structured interviews concerning PDRC Enhanced Scheduling.This is a collection of ideas that build on the core PDRC concept to further improve tactical departure scheduling by leveraging the power of Center/Tower information exchange demonstrated by PDRC.The ideas are in various stages of maturity, and the purpose of the March 2013 shadow evaluation was to gather subject-matter expert feedback to guide further development of these ideas.The Enhanced Scheduling ideas are related by the goal to reduce unnecessary CFR constraints, reduce ground delay, improve automation, and enable greater situational awareness.Most of the Enhanced Scheduling ideas center on the new prototype multi-domain "what if" scheduler discussed in Section 4.8.This new software process was used for live-traffic demonstrations of some of the more mature ideas during the March 2013 focus group sessions.The following is a list of the ideas under consideration:• Early Indication of Tactical Delay • Size of an Assigned Slot (e.g., Can I Leave Early/Late?) • Release Flights with a Large Center-Approved Window • Schedule but Look for a Better Time • Automatic Scheduling Based Upon Actual OUT Notification • Center Decision Support Tool for CFR constraint planning NASA is currently evaluating which of these ideas merit further research.One of the enhanced scheduling ideas has been developed into a proposed concept for Tactical Departure Scheduling Control by Exception.This new concept seeks to address a shortfall in current-day tactical departure scheduling operations wherein CFR restrictions are applied uniformly over broad time periods, resulting in unnecessary delay to some flights.NASA recently awarded a SBIR Phase I contract to pursue the Control by Exception idea.This research activity will include shortfalls analysis, concept development, identification of required operational metrics, and a concept feasibility assessment.
7.3TRACON Departure Scheduling In the introduction, PDRC was described as "a logical step towards the NextGen vision of fullyintegrated arrival/departure/surface operations."Tactical departure scheduling coordination between a well-equipped airport Tower and its home Center seemed a logical starting point for several reasons:• The Center portion of the process was already supported by a widely-deployed decision support tool (TMA/EDC) • Manually computed and communicated OFF time inputs to TMA/EDC were an obvious shortfall and trajectory-based Tower tools were on the not-too-distant horizon • Previous research had established the value of automating CFR release time coordination • Decisions to implement tactical TMIs (i.e., CFR) are local and therefore accessible to the research teamThe PDRC concept intentionally focused on applying NextGen trajectory-based technology to a portion of the tactical departure scheduling problem that analysis [5] showed to be commonly occurring in present-day NAS operations.Now that the first step has been taken, other tactical departure scheduling challenges can be addressed by building on the PDRC foundation.Feedback from stakeholders and experiences conducting the Block 1 & 2 evaluations have strongly suggested that the next step needs to address the challenges of TRACON-level constraints and departures from less-equipped airports.These needs have been a recurring theme in PDRC team interactions with FAA stakeholders dating back to 2010 and they have been reinforced by feedback received from Block 1 & 2 evaluation participants during the PDRC "how goes it" meetings.Work on the TRACON Departure Scheduling research is currently underway.Section 4.9 discussed new multi-airport capabilities that have been developed to gather quantitative shortfalls analysis data and that will serve as the foundation for a prototype TRACON departure scheduling system.Additionally, NASA observers are spending time on position at D10 TRACON during dynamic weather and traffic events to thoroughly characterize the present-day system and shortfalls.Lessons learned from these D10 observations will be validated with data from other facilities throughout the NAS.Finally, NASA has been coordinating with subjectmatter experts and stakeholders to ensure that this new work is well-conceived and aligned with needs.It is expected that this line of research will contribute to future developments for the TBFM Integrated Departure Arrival Capability (IDAC).
Concluding remarksThis is the final report for a multi-year concept and technology development and evaluation activity directed towards improving tactical departure scheduling operations.The research commenced with a study of the present-day system to characterize the operation and identify shortfalls.A key finding from this study was that tactically-scheduled departures occur 3.5 times as often as departures subject to strategic constraints.Another key finding was that 25% of flights subject to arrival metering are scheduled into the system as tactical departures while still on the airport surface.This percentage is expected to increase as the TBFM program continues to expand the range of metering through more development of adjacent center metering, coupled scheduling, and extended metering functions.The initial study identified shortfalls in present-day tactical departure scheduling wherein a significant number of flights missed their reserved slot in the en route traffic flow due to uncertainty in the tactical departure scheduling process.NASA developed the PDRC concept to address these shortfalls and assembled a prototype system to validate the concept and demonstrate system performance in operational field evaluations.The PDRC prototype utilized a research version of the FAA's operational TMA (rTMA) and a research surface management system (SDSS); the latter served as a surrogate for anticipated NextGen trajectory-based surface decision support tools (e.g., TFDM).PDRC technology development included a two-way interface between rTMA and SDSS.The two-way interface enabled trajectory-based OFF time and departure runway predictions to be delivered from SDSS to rTMA and a full complement of rTMA scheduling information to be delivered to SDSS.The PDRC two-way interface also enabled electronic CFR coordination between the Center TMC and the Tower TMC/FLM.NASA conducted two operational evaluations of PDRC.The evaluations were based at NASA's NTX Research Station and included participation from TMCs and FLMs at Fort Worth Center and DFW's East and West Towers.The evaluations ran for a total of 29 weeks in 2012 and early 2013.During these evaluations more than 230 flights were scheduled with the PDRC prototype.Positive subject-matter expert feedback was received throughout the evaluation and significant improvements in tactical departure OFF time compliance were demonstrated.Off-time Compliance (OTC) results from the two PDRC evaluations were compared against a year-long sample of baseline data.Since the goal is to reduce uncertainty, key OTC metrics are the standard deviation and the absolute average error.PDRC showed a 43% improvement over the baseline standard deviation and a 43% improvement in absolute average error.A key feature of the PDRC concept is coordination and communication based on a single target release time rather than a release window.
Appendix A: Auxiliary FiguresThis appendix contains auxiliary figures that are believed to be helpful supplements to the report, but have been located here to improve readability.Some of these auxiliary figures have been excerpted from the companion documents (i.e., ConOps and Technology Description) to facilitate easy reference.In those cases, the figure excerpts include a few paragraphs of descriptive text from the companion document.The study of January 2011 NAS operational data also examined the relative frequency of tactical and strategic departure scheduling.Figure 9:1 uses the large gray ellipse to depict the entire set of domestic flights in the NAS (more than 1 million) for that month.Departures subject to strategic traffic management initiatives are shown in the orange ellipse.Tactical departures are shown in the 3 green ellipses.There were approximately 3.5 times as many tactical departures as strategic departures in January 2011.The results shown in Figure 9:1 distinguish between inbound and outbound tactical departures.These two types of tactical departure scheduling are described in detail in Section 3.3.Inbound is associated with TMA arrival metering and outbound is associated with TMA's En Route Departure Capability (EDC) function.For this analysis, an aircraft was counted as being tactically scheduled only if the aircraft was both scheduled and 'accepted' or 'frozen' into the TMA Arrival or EDC system.A significant number of aircraft (approximately 18,489 during January, 2011) were initially scheduled in the TMA system, but the scheduling process was not finalized by either "accepting" or "freezing" it.This suggests an even larger pool of tactical departure operations may exist.It is worth noting that inbound tactical departure scheduling occurred about five times more frequently than outbound tactical departure scheduling in January 2011 operations.A high-level diagram of the architecture used in PDRC is depicted in Figure 9:2.This diagram depicts the primary PDRC components involved in a configuration in which a single surface system connects to a single rTMA system.The architecture however is capable of supporting multiple rTMA systems connected to a single SDSS, as well as daisy-chaining data to multiple downstream instances of PDRC.
TMC feedback formsThis subsection contains screenshots of the electronic forms used to gather feedback from the TMCs, STMCs, and FLMs at DFW and ZFW.These webpage-style forms could be completed directly from the PDRC user interface.
Appendix B -TRACON transit time prediction improvementThis appendix presents analysis conducted in Nov-Dec 2011 that supported improvements in rTMA predictions of TRACON transit time.Highlights from this work were published in Reference 6, but the complete analysis has not been published before now.The purpose of the departure route adherence accuracy metric is to assess the predicted horizontal departure route versus the actual route the flights follow and determine the effect such differences may have on flight time estimates.Analysis of departure route prediction accuracy was performed on departures to Houston Intercontinental (IAH) which is the tactical departure route associated with the highest departure delay at DFW.For this route, DARTZ is the DFW departure fix and is the easternmost fix on the south departure gate of D10 TRACON.The primary departure route filed for the DFW to IAH departure is the DARTZ RNAV.The departure procedure is shown in Figure 10:1(a).Note that the DARTZ3 procedure is no longer current.Since this analysis was performed with DARTZ3 data, the older departure procedure plate will be used to be consistent with the data.Nov 1-6, 2011 timeframe.The red track is of AAL1560, which is a representative nominal flight used throughout this analysis.
The problemCurrently, departure logic in PDRC's TMA/EDC component predicts that the flight will fly an adaptable number of nautical miles in the direction of departure and then acquire the first departure fix in the departure route.Analysis of the DFW departure data revealed that the first fix was significantly downstream in the aircraft's route of flight.Due to this, the en route transit time predicted by TMA/EDC assumed that the flight would head directly toward this fix instead of capturing the nominal waypoints along the RNAV departure route.The "before" data is plotted as blue diamonds for both runways.The green triangles show "after" data and will be discussed later.The red X symbols show the average TMA Estimated Time-of-Arrival (ETA) error for each of the data sets.Figure 10:3 shows that ETAs for Runway 35 departures exhibited a mean error of 176 seconds prior to the solution.The "before" sample size for Runway 36 is quite small; however, the two data points are tightly clustered near 235 seconds of ETA error.
The solutionReducing routing error within the TRACON is straightforward -simply have rTMA implement the expected departure procedures.The challenge is how to implement the departure procedures.The solution selected was to create a more specific departure routing that includes the expected TRACON departure fixes from the RNAV departure route.The routing assignment in adaptation was linked to the departure runway, which is automatically passed to TMA/EDC from PDRC's SDSS component.The solution leverages existing capability within the rTMA analysis_categories and category_definitions adaptation files (with a change also made to the initial heading/distance values in satellite_category_definitions).There are some downsides to this approach.The number of points (fixes) in the route is limited, and the solution diverges from how other arrival/departure procedures are implemented within rTMA.A final note about the PDRC implementation of TRACON departure routing is appropriate.The PDRC solution implemented the routes using decision_tree logic simply because it was the quickest, no-software-change solution that would suffice, albeit with limitations.It is the norm, however, for rTMA routing to be directly derived from the Host Computer System (HCS) adaptation and more specifically from the HCS files PAR, PDR, and PDAR (preferred arrival route, preferred departure route, and preferred departure/arrival route, respectively).These are implemented in rTMA as nas_pars, nas_pdrs, and nas_pdars.The TRACON departure routes are contained within PDAR, but since this is Center adaptation, the first fix in the route begins at the departure fix and thus does not include the interior TRACON fixes.A suggested final implementation is to use the same or similar syntax as found in the nas_pdars file for a TRACON departure routes file.This would allow reuse, with slight modifications, of the existing software ingest and all of the associated route processing logic.
ResultsThe "after" portions of previous figures will now be examined to see the effect of implementing the interim, adaptation-only solution in rTMA.Figure 10:2(b) provides a graphical view of rTMA route predictions for a DFW departure after implementing this solution.As illustrated, the predictions and the actual tracks align closely.When compared with the "before," immediately to the left, the improvement is striking.However, the horizontal route predictions are only a means to computing ETAs at downstream fixes.The green triangles in Figure 10:3 show the difference between the actual time of flight and the TMA predicted time of flight to the departure point after the solution was implemented.The "after" data sample consists of 53 flights.Mean ETA error for runway 35 departures has been reduced from 176 seconds to 28 seconds.Runway 36 demonstrated similar improvement, with a mean error of 235 seconds prior to the routing solution that was reduced to 62 seconds after the solution.
Appendix C -AMA taxi time prediction improvementThis appendix presents research performed to improve SDSS predictions of Aircraft Movement Area (AMA) taxi times.This work has not been published elsewhere.The specific objective of this work was to determine the best possible speed to use when modeling departure taxi operations in the AMA.
ApproachA multivariate regression analysis methodology will be used.The dependent variable will be the spot-to-queue taxi time (AMA), with independent variables being aircraft type, carrier, spot group, runway.The independent variables to form a matrix of possible factors that influence AMA taxi time.The best possible speed will be the one that reduces the spot-to-queue taxi time error, as well as the standard deviation of that error.The current default taxi speed used by SDSS for all departure flights is 17 knots.To find the best possible AMA taxi speed to use, first the difference in predicted spot-to-queue taxi time and actual spot-to-queue time is minimized.The actual spot-to-queue time is defined as the Queue Entry Time minus the Spot Crossing Time.The Spot Crossing time is the time at which the flight crosses the spot and enters the Aircraft Movement Area.The Queue Entry time is the first time at which the flight status changes in SDSS to "In Queue."The predicted spot-toqueue time is derived using the TrajectoryDashboard-1.0tool -an analysis companion to SDSS.This returns a set of intersections, time and distances from each gate node to each runway.The values of interest correspond with the spot to the queue entry polygon, but there is no intersection that rests exactly at the entry of the queue polygon.To solve this problem, the intersection closest to the queue entry polygon is used, and then a buffer distance is added or subtracted to end up with the exact distance (using the node-link SDSS model) from the spot to the queue entry.An example of how this is done is shown in the following section.
Determining Spot-to-Queue DistancesTable 11:1 shows a set of intersections and distances from the TrajectoryDashboard-1.0tool.The geometry for this example is shown in Figure 11:1.The intersection closest to the queue entry polygon is found.In the example shown, this is intersection "L-Y".The total spot-to-queue distance is "distance at L-Y" minus "distance at "A-010-K5" (spot) minus distance between queue polygon and intersection "L-Y".These "buffer" distances are stored for each route, and then applied during the calculation of predicted AMA taxi times.To derive the taxi time, simply divide distance by speed.This allows insertion of different values for the speed to determine which one will minimize error.To find the set of speeds that minimize AMA taxi time error and standard deviation, actual flight data are categorized by different combinations of aircraft type, carrier, runway, and spot groups (ramp areas).This analysis will be explained in the next section.Using the training set, data is grouped using the categories listed in Table 11:3 below.For each unique category grouping, the median spot-to-queue taxi speed is stored.This value is then applied to the test data set to determine the difference in predicted and actual spot-to-queue taxi time.
Determine AMA Speeds by Groups
Data FiltersFilters are applied to the actual flight data to ensure the predicted and actual spot-to-queue taxi times are relevant to the analysis.The following filters are applied:• Actual spot crossed must not be <null> • The predicted runway at time of spot crossing must equal the actual runway used • The predicted spot at time of spot crossing must equal the actual spot used • The flight must not have an EDCT associated with it
ResultsThe results of the analysis are shown in this section.From these results the variable grouping with the minimum error and standard deviation is chosen as the new set of AMA taxi speeds to be used by SDSS.11:3.A visual check of the data shows that each combination performs better than the default 17 knots by bringing the mean and median error near 0. The default 17 knots return an error closer to -30 seconds.Also, the absolute error appears to be reduced.A more detailed depiction of the mean, median, standard deviation, and inter-quartile range are shown later in this section to facilitate choosing the category grouping with the most improved performance.The "tightness" of the errors is shown in the next two figures in terms of standard deviation and inter-quartile range.during the first three weeks (11/5/2012 to 11/27/2012) of the PDRC Block 2 operational evaluation.The analysis also examined the accuracy of OFF time predictions from the PDRC Block 1 operational evaluation (4/30/2012 -7/26/2012), compared to partial results from the Block 2 operational evaluation.The OFF time error is shown as an aggregate value (median) as a function of time-to-OFF.11.8.1 Spot-to-Queue Taxi Time Error Data from 11/5/2012 to 11/27/2012 (a portion of Block 2 operational evaluation) were analyzed to find the spot-to-queue taxi time error.The actual spot-to-queue taxi time was compared to two sets of predicted values, one using the new departure_taxi_speed_decision_tree and one using the default value of 17 knots for taxi speed.The following filters were applied to the data before the plots were created:• Actual spot crossed must not be <null> • The predicted runway at time of spot crossing must equal the actual runway • The predicted spot at time of spot crossing must equal the actual spot • The flight must not have an EDCT time After these filters were applied, the AMA taxi time error was calculated as the predicted spot-toqueue taxi time minus the actual spot-to-queue taxi time.Flights with absolute taxi time error greater than the 75th percentile of the absolute error were removed from the analysis.12 Appendix D: Block 1 operational evaluation dataThis appendix contains data from the PDRC Block 1 operational evaluation.These data were used in the OFF time compliance comparison and other analyses.

To determine AMA taxi speeds for use in this analysis, actual flight data is taken from 11/5/2012 to 12/13/2012.The data is split into training and test sets.The training set is used to derive speed values, which are then used by the test set to determine the error in predicted and actual spot-toqueue taxi times.The test set, which was chosen at random, contains flight data from the days listed inTable 11:2.

Figures 11 :11Figures 11:2 and 11:3 show the real and absolute error in AMA taxi times as a box plot.The variable combination number can be linked to the category grouping in Table11:3.A visual check of the data shows that each combination performs better than the default 17 knots by bringing the mean and median error near 0. The default 17 knots return an error closer to -30 seconds.Also, the absolute error appears to be reduced.A more detailed depiction of the mean, median, standard deviation, and inter-quartile range are shown later in this section to facilitate choosing the category grouping with the most improved performance.

Figure 11 :116 shows the real and absolute standard deviation of the errors, while Figure11:7 shows the interquartile range of the real and absolute errors.Excluding combination 14 (Runway), all other combinations show similar values for standard deviation.The smallest inter-quartile range values are achieved using combinations 4 (Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group), 9 (Carrier, Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group), or 12 (Carrier, Runway, Spot Group).

Table 6 :61 provides a hypotheticalexample that is representative ofactual observed variations. Notethat the TMA/EDC CoordinatedRelease Times are displayed toCenter TMCs at minutes-levelgranularity.[1]er receiving the time window verbally from the Center, the Tower TMC/FLM may apply different interpretations to the information.In some cases the TMC receiving the information may assume the beginning of the first minute to the end of the last minute given.In the case of the time communicated at 17:23 to 17:26, this interpretation would be 17:23:00 to 17:26:59, which would mean a 3:59 departure window.PDRC reduces the ambiguity in CFR coordination communications via a digital interface (i.e., the PDRC double-headed arrow) between the Tower and Center decision support tools.Section 6.2.5 of the ConOps[1]describes how the Coordinated Release Time (a.k.a.Scheduled Departure Time in PDRC software terminology) is delivered from rTMA/EDC to SDSS where it is displayed at seconds-level precision.For the Table6:1 example, PDRC presents the Tower TMC/FLM with an unambiguous Coordinated Release Time of 17:25:26 to use for CFR coordination with the Local controller.In the present-day environment (i.e., without Tower electronic flight strips) the Tower TMC/FLM will round the seconds-level precision PDRC time to the appropriate minute and communicate this target time to the Local controller per standard procedures.

Table 6 :63 presents summary statistics from three time difference (i.e., delta time) calculations that may be useful metrics for the CFR scheduling process.The two left columns present statistics from the Block 1 & 2 evaluations for the delta time between the first surface surveillance track and the Tower Request For Release Time (RFRT).Larger mean and median values are desirable, as this typically indicates earlier scheduling of CFR flights.Earlier scheduling is helpful in finding available slots in the overhead stream earlier and achieving a stable schedule.The significance of the maximum value for this delta time is debatable.An aircraft could be powered up and generating ASDE-X track data for an indefinite period before the Tower chose to initiate an RFRT.However, the minimum values for this delta time are of significant interest for tactical departure scheduling.Surveillance acquisition is a key event for trajectory-based decision support tools like SDSS.With surveillance-based state information predictive accuracy is greatly increased.A closer examination of the data shows only two out of the 198 Block 1 & 2 flights had CFR requests prior to ASDE-X surveillance acquisition.

[1,2,3]tion to the new two-way communications interface between rTMA and SDSS, the PDRC research activity produced several other important technology developments and improvements.The PDRC research activity developed rTMA to reduce technology transfer risk and facilitate field evaluations.The rTMA has become an integral element in several other NASA research activities.In collaboration with the FAA STBO office the TSDE air carrier interface was extended and specialized to provide PDRC with data from American Airlines.PDRC research identified improvements in SDSS modeling of Aircraft Movement Area taxi operations to improve OFF time predictions.Analysis of airborne time-to-fly uncertainty uncovered large errors in TMA modeling of TRACON departure routes.New adaptation leveraged PDRCprovided departure runway information to reduce average TRACON time-to-fly prediction errors by up to a factor of 6 (i.e., average errors of 176 seconds reduced to 28 seconds) depending on departure runway and departure fix combination.A new multi-domain, "what-if" scheduler was developed to explore ideas for PDRC scheduling enhancements.Finally, a new multi-airport data processing system was developed to support follow-on research into TRACON departure scheduling.This section provides a list of acronyms and terms relevant to the PDRC-IADS research activity.Identical glossaries are being maintained across the PDRC-IADS document family[1,2,3].Glossary PGUIPlanview GUIRFRTRequest For Release TimeRMPResearch Management PlanrTMAResearch TMAADIF RTTARTS Data Interface Research Transition Team -a joint NASA/FAA activity to facilitate NextGenAPREQApproval Request -see CFR technology transferARTCC SADDAir Route Traffic Control Center -one of twenty FAA facilities responsible for Schedule a Departure DialogSAIEEn Route ATC in the NAS System Analysis Integration and Evaluation (NASA Project)ATC SDIFAir Traffic Control Surface Data InterfaceATCT SDSSAir Traffic Control Tower Surface Decision Support System -often used interchangeably with the originalCAPCollaborative Arrival Planning SMS nameCDIF SDTCAP Data Interface Scheduled Departure Time -proposed Coordinated Release Time (see CRT)CDQMCollaborative Departure Queue Management computed by TMA and communicated to SDSS by PDRC.CFR SMSCall For Release -a TMI used to regulate the flow of departures into a Surface Management System -see SDSSSTBOconstrained overhead stream (also known as APREQ).

The charts in Figure 11:4 depict the real and absolute median error for each variable combination.All combinations results in a decreased value of real and absolute error when compared to the default speed of 17 knots.In terms of real median error, combination 7 (Carrier, Aircraft Type) results in the least amount of error.In terms of absolute median error, combinations 4 (Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group), 9 (Carrier, Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group), and 12 (Carrier, Runway, Spot Group) share the smallest value.The next set of charts (Figure 11:5) shows the real and absolute mean error in AMA taxi time.Once again, combination 7 (Carrier, Aircraft Type) has the smallest actual (real) error.The smallest mean absolute error is shared between combinations 4 (Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group), 9 (Carrier, Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group), and 12 (Carrier, Runway, Spot Group).
Recommendations based on multivariate regression analysisThe variable combinations that exhibit the overall smallest amount of error and "tightness" are• combination 4: Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group • combination 9: Carrier, Aircraft Type, Runway, Spot Group • combination 12: Carrier, Runway, Spot GroupWith regards to implementation, either combination 4 or combination 12 would be the least difficult to accomplish.Combination 9 would add complexity to the departure_taxi_speed_decision tree without adding any more reduction in error.
Implementation challengesThe recommended three-variable solution led to large adaptation decision trees, which negatively impacted SDSS processing speed.Consequently, the team elected to use a less-demanding twovariable solution.Aircraft type and carrier were selected as the variables.Implementation of the new decision tree involved additional design decisions for specific variables.For example, a B350 aircraft was found to be used only 4 times throughout the original multivariate analysis, each with a different carrier.Instead of splitting the decision tree by carrier, in this case the mean value between the carriers was used in order to avoid creating a larger file size that could potentially decrease SDSS system performance.This methodology was used for various other aircraft types when it was clear that a single value would be fine.
Post-implementation analysisThis follow-up analysis documented the impact of the new AMA departure taxi speed logic implemented in SDSS.The analysis examined the accuracy of SDSS AMA taxi time calculations
Appendix F: Baseline dataThis appendix contains the Baseline data set used to compute OFF Time Compliance comparison statistics and histograms.These data were gathered from ZFW operational TMA/EDC recordings beginning in November 2010 and running through October 2011.The initial set consisted of 451 DFW departures that were tactically scheduled with the operational TMA/EDC system.The data have been culled as described below: The last two rounds of culling summarized in Table 14:1 were to account for the absence of research observers during Baseline operations.
RwyActual departure runway detected from surface surveillance tracks.

	section provides a list of references, applicable documents, and related research for the PDRC-IADS research activity. To facilitate document tracking, identical reference lists are being maintained across the PDRC-IADS document family [1, 2, 3]. Consequently, this list should be treated as a bibliography of relevant documents instead of a strict list of references. Documents are listed by category rather than in order of citation, and some documents in the bibliography may not be directly referenced in this document. PDRC documents:

		(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

Pakistan and Afghanistan being immediate states have inter-connected future with socio-economic and security prospects. Principles of Coordinated Border Management (CBM) approach have been extracted on the basis of in-depth interviews with security agencies and policymakers to understand the real time needs. The current research employs mixed method approach. Process Tracing is employed in this research to comprehend the causal mechanism behind the contemporary issue of border management system. A detailed statistical analysis of prospect outcomes has been given to validate the implication of CBM. Implication range of CBM has been discussed with positive and probably negative impacts due to its wide range of significance. This research gives an analysis of feasibility support to exercise CBM in best interest of the state and secure future of the region.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Current study was quantitative in nature. All elementary level enrolled students at government schools in the province of the Punjab made the population of the study. Multistage sampling was used to select the sample from four districts of one division (Sargodha) of the Punjab province i.e., Sargodha.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

These exciting advances have given rise to a new field of study within linguistics, termed Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL). This paper aims to fill the gap of MALL research in the area of grammar teaching in the Pakistan. Two BS Part 1 classes from University of Sindh, Jamshoro, were chosen for this quasi-experimental study. In total, 62 out of 101 students volunteered to use the Hello English application for 2 months, making up the experiment group, and the remaining 39 students were put in a control group. Paired Samples T-Test was run on pretest and posttest results which revealed no significant difference in both groups’ performances, proving that Hello English application could not significantly improve students’ grammar performance. However, in spite of the lack of a significant difference between the test results, the data gathered through the attitudinal survey showed that students still found mobile application very easy to use and effective in language learning.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

There had been many crematoriums in the city but with the passage of time, one after another, disappeared from the land after partition of the Sub-continent. Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
