AUTOMATION SYSTEM CONCEPTFigure 1 gives a diagrammatic representation of the overall system.Its key ground-based elements are the Traffic Mangement Advisor (TMA), the Dewent Advis (DA), and the Fnal Approach Spacing Tool (FAST).The functions of eah element and the relatonships between elemen are isued below.The primary function of the TMA is to plan the most efficient landing order and to assign optimally spaced landing times to all arvals.These time schedules are generated while aircraft are 150 to 200 n.m. from the airport Te TMA algorithm plans these times such that traffic approaching from all directions will merge on the final approach without conflicts and with optimal spacing.The TMA also assists the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) Traffic Manager in rerouting traffic from an overloaded sector to a lightly loaded one, a process known as gate balancing.Another function of the TMA is to assist the Center Trafflc Manager in efficiently rerouting and rescheduling traffic in response to a runway reconfiguration or a weather disturance.In general, the functions of the TMA involve assisting the Center Traffic Manager in coordinating and controlling the traffic flow between Centers, between sectors within a Center, and between the Center and the Terminal Radar Approach (TRACON) Facility.Moreover, the TMA must permit the Center Traffic Manager to specify critical flow control parameters such as runway accepance rate and to override computer generated decisions manually.At a Center, the controller positions requing the highest skills and mental workload are those handling descent traffic.These positions are responsible for producing an orderly flow of traffic into the TRACON.The Descent Advisor (DA) is intended to provide controllers in these positions with flexible tools to implement the traffic plan generated by the TMA.For all aircraft entering an arrival sector, the DA implemented at that sector computes estimated times of arrival (ETAs) at its respective arrival gate.These ETA computations take into account the airspace structre and ATC procedures of each arrival sector.For simplicity, only two DAs are shown in figure 1, but in general there can be four or more, at least one for each arrival gate feeding traffic into the TRACON.The ETAs from all arrival sectors are sent as input to the TMA which uses them to calculate efficient, conflict free-landing schedules.These scheduled times of arrivals (STAs) at the runway are then tansformed by the TMA to gate arrival times by subtracting the time to fly from the gate to touchdown, and are sent to the DAs at the appropiate aival areas.Upon receiving these STAs the DA algorithm generates cruise and descent clearances which controllers can use to keep aircraft on schedule.For aircraft that drift off their planed time schedules, the controller can request revised clearances that correct such time errors to the extent possible.If this concept is implemented in today's environment, the controller would have to issue the clearances by voice, but in the near future it will be more efficient to isse them via the proposed ground-to-air data link.The TRACON controllers take over control of taffic at the feeder gates.They merge the traffic converging on the fnal approach path while making sure that aircraft are properly spaced.If the Center controllers have delivered aircraft at the gates on time using the DA tools, the TRACON controlers odinarily will need to make only small corrections in the relative positions of aircraft to achieve the desired spacing.The FAST assists the controller in making these corrections with high accuracy and a miimum number of heading vectors and speed clearances.Achieving precise spacing between aircraft on final approach ensures that landing rtes will always be close to the thoetical capacity of the runway.Another qte of tool designed for the TRACON controller is the Tactical Advisor.This tool helps the controller to replan traffic quickly in response to several special sitations, such as missed approaches, runway changes, and unexected conflts.TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ADVISOR (TMA)   This section describes elements of the TMA, with emphasis on the design of the scheduler and graphical interface.
OverviewThe Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) comprises algorithms, a graphical interface, and interactive tools for use by the Center affic manager or TRACON controllers in m g the flow of traffic within the terminal area.The primaiy algorithm incorporated in it is a real-time scheduler which genertes efficient laning sequences and landing times for arrivals within about 200 n.m. from touchdown.Its graphical interface and intactive tools are designed to assist the taffic manager in monitoring the automatically generated landing schedules, to overide the automatic scheduler with manual inputs and to change scheduling parameters in real time.It has been implemented on a separate worstation that is interfaced with the workstations rmning the DAs at the various arrival areas.In essence, the scheduler is a real-time algorithm transforms sequences of arrivals into sequences of scheduled times of anival (STAs) using one of sever scheduling protocols selected by the traffic manager.Operation in real time implies that the algorithm generates the STAs in a ail frct of the dme it tkes each aicraft to fly from its inal position to tuchdown.This condition places important computational constaints on the algorithm.Since the scheduler is the main computaional unit of the TMA, its functions and operations are described fst.Next is a description of the graphical in e and the set of tools the traffic manager uses to monitor and to interact with the scheduler in real time.
Design IssuesThe scheduling and freeze h are key parmneters in determining the performance of the scheduler.The scheduling horizon is a tme interval specifying when an aircraft becomes eligible for scheduling.The freeze horizon is a time iMterval specifying when an aicraft's STA will no longer be changed without manual intervention.The TMA gets periodic udates of the estimated times of arrival (ETAs) for all airaft.These updates come from the DA at the sector currently controlling the aicraft.The TMA then uses the ETAs to determine when aircraft are eligible for scheduling or having their scheduled times frozen.Although the scheduling and freeze horizns are time dependent quantities, they can also be approximatd in the spatial domain by concentric circles with the arrival aiqxrt at the center.The circles representig the hoizons are superimposed in figure 2 on the arrival airspace stuture of the Denver Center.The location of the fmeze horizon (in space and time) must balance two conflicting objectives.On the one hand, it must be chosen sufficiently early in the approach in order to give the arrival controllers adequate ime and arspace to meet the scheduler-generated STAs.At the very latest, the freeze horizon must be chosen before arrivals reach the area where descent clearances are issued.This area is about 30 min to touchdown.On the other hand, the location of fte freeze horizon should not be chosen so early that arrivals from nearby airports often appear later than the freeze horizon, thus missing the scheduling window altogether.Also, an early freeze horizon increases the probability of schedule-distubing events occuring between the freeze horizon and the TRACON boundary, such as weadwr dis- turbances.The rescheduling of frozen aircra necessitated by such occurrences causes an undesirable increase in controller woriload, and thus should be minimized.These considerations, as well as the results of simulation tes and experience with the current metering system at the Denver Center suggest a freeze horizon 35 minutes to touchdown, with a schedulng window 10 minutes long.Aircraft whose ETAs are in the scheduling window are 516 opated upon by the scheduling algorithm to genere the optimwn sequne.When it becomes necessary to reshedule certain airat, the last and best ty to do so occws in the region where the arrivals transition from the Center into the TRACON at the feeder gates.This region is identified in figure 2 as the TRACON rescheduling region.In this transitin region, the schedulig pfocess described above can be repeated.Since the scheduling window is narrow and close to touchdown, rescheduling in the TRACON region consists primarily of fine tuning the Center- determined arrival sequence.Extensive changes in the schedule for arrivals this close to the runway are neither necessary nor feasible.Frequent reordering of arrival sequences or large changes in STAs at this point would disrupt the orderliness of the arrival flow and produce complex trajectories in the TRACON airspace, thereby increasing controller workload.The primary reason for rescheduling aicraft in the TRACON airspace arises fom the need to handle missed appoaches, emergency arcraf, and changes in runway.One of the most critical aspects of designing a scheduler is definig the procedures for establishing the arrival sequence.In today's ATC system controllers generally attempt to maintain a first-come-first-served (FCFS) sequence when vectoring aircraft for arrival in a terninal area.Generally first-m e refers to projected arrival time at the runway but it is possible to define first-come in ofter ways.For instan, first-come could mean the order in which the aircraft cross a point in space such as the Center boundary.Time based orderings can be static or dynamic.The initial estimate of arrival time for each aircraf establishes a certain arrival order but subsequent ETA updates may change the arrival order.Controllers frequently deviate from a strict FCFS order in order to accomplish specific objectives.When decisions need to be made in sequencing of a group of aircraft factors such as wind direction, arcraft type, and the route topology are all taken into account by the controller in deciding on a suence.This takes considerabl skill and judgment, and different controllers may handle similar conditions quite differently.The approach taken in the TMA to address these concerns is to provide various choies to the controller which are selectable in r me Design of Scheduler Optimization of aircraft arrval schedules has been the subject of numerous sudies in recent years (refs. 3-8).However, in the satdies cited, mization benefits have been difficult to quantify because they are sensitive to many factors that are difficult to measure or estimate.Such factors include the choice of representative arrival sequences, the distribuion of aircraft weight classes and the selection of base line conditions against which schedule Wtimization benefits can be accuraely gaugedIn the most recent study of this problem (ref.8)  scheduling efficiency is computed by a Monte Carlo simulation for the three types of scheduling methods implemented in the TMA.Results of this study will be sumnmarzed aft descrtib he real time sculer.A theory for the design of real-time schedulers capabl of handling the diverse conditions g in ATC has not been ated compnsively in the reserch litera.In the US.SA, the best klown implementation of a real- time scheduler is the En Route Metering (ERM) system, which has been in operation at various Centers, luding the Denver Center, for a number of years.ERM has evolved, with fair success, as a tool for controlling the flow of taffic into the TRACON under capacity limited conditions.However, it is not designed to produce conflict-free, optimum arrival schedules at the runway for a mix of aircraft weight classes, as is the objective in this design.In West Germany, fte COMPAS system (ref. 3)  undergoing tests at the Frnkfurt Airport also incorpoates a real-time sceuler.The design descrbed hemrm expads on featues in ERM and COMPAS and also incorporates new graphical and interactive concepts that capitize on the capabilides of high perfoman wo .The TMA can be configured in a variety of ways.The user can select between time based and distance based sequencing and also whether the sequence is static or is updated dynamically.The user cai aLso enable or disable time advance and optiiation.All of the oons can be changed at any time and will take immediate effect on the current schedule.The first step in the scheduling process is to arrange the aircraft in an ordered list based on the currently selected sequencing method.For example, if the sequence method is set to dynamic time the airrft with thpe earliestETA 517 is placed at the beginnmg of the i and the acraft with the latest ETA is placd atthe end of the list Once the type of sequence to use has been established the scheduler next checks the ineraicaft time spacings on final approach.For those with less than the minimum allowed, the scheduler adds just eough time to meet the minimum distanceIon sadards required by FAA regulaions.It should be noted that the minimum sepaion dis depend on the ahiaft weight classes (heavy, large, and light) of the leaing and tailing aircaft Since the schedulr works on the basis of time and not s , it is fi necessary to tansform the distances into equivalent time separations using procedures described in reference 4. Te results of these transfomations are a set of time intervals which spcify the minimum time spacings on final approach for allnine possible landing sequences of aircraft with three weight clasms.A complicating factor is that the transfoatons depend implicitly on the ground speed of aiaft on final approach.Since ground speed depends on both final approach air speed and wind speed, it becomes necessary to update the time spacings in real time.This cumbersome and complicated procedure should be eliminated by developing new criteria specifically for tme-based minimum -tion standards.he opeation of the basic schlduling algorithm without time advance or optimization can be illustrated grahically with the help of time lines drawn side by side as in figwe 3(a).The dme line on the right shows the ETAs of several large and heavy aircraft within a scheduling window.Te earliest ETA is at the bottom of the list and icreang future time is toward the top.For illustrative purposes, only two minimum separation times are used, 2 min.for a heavy followed by a large aircraft and 1 min.for all other sequences.Since the time separations between ETAs in this list are generally smaller than the minimums, the scheduler has to delay aircraft to with the minimums.The result of this operaton is shown on the STA time line.Here, horizontal lines connect STAs and ETAs of the same aircraf The original ETA order has been maintained as indicated by the fact that none of the connecting lines cross each other.The effect of the time advane option to the basic scheduler is ilustaed in figure 3(b).A 1-min time advance relative to the ETA was allowed for each aiat The effect for many ahiaft is a rdcinof delay and fuel consumption.On the other hand, those aircraft whose time is advanced may experience increased fuel consmption because of higher-thanoptimal cruise and desent speeds.Therefore, in assesng the oveall benefit of time advance, it is necessary to b time and fuel savings for those acaft whose delays are redwed against an increase in fuel sump for those whose time is advanced.Nevertheless, in most situas, time advance is iely to be advatageous.In o d of these acle-of the dr attempt to be intelligent in applying time advance by not advancg aira when the benefits to be gained are minimal.The scheduler does this in two ways.Frst, the amount of advance is controlled by specifying both a maximum advance and a fction of the total advance available that is to be applied.The scheduler first determines the minimum time to landing for a given aircraft as previously defined.Only a fraction of the total advance available is used by the scheduer.This amount is compared with the maximum allowable advance and te smaller of the two quantities is used to arrive at the aicraft's scheduled time.ITe second technique used by the scheduler is to advance a given aircraft only when it is part of a closely spaced group of aicaf A closely spaced group is defined as a set of consecutive aircraft which are spaced at or below the minimum allowable separion.The number of consecutive ahrraft which defines a group is an adjustable parameter, typically set to four.A position shifting scheduler with or without time advance removes the constraint of presevig the ETA order when generating the STA list Position shifng for aicraft scheduling was studied by Dear (ref.5) and subsequently by others (ref 6).The scheduler implemented here optimizes the STA list with rspect to a user specified maximum number of position shifts.This means that the landing order of an aircraft may not be moved more than the scified number of aaft ahead of or behind the FCFS order.The schedule produced by the position shift scheduler with time advance is imlustrated in figure 3(c) for a single position shift.It can be seen that position shifting has provided additional delay reduction.However, these reductions are highly dependent on the mix of airraft in the list There would be no advantage in position shifting if the minimum tine separation between all airaft were the same.Position shifting tends to bunch aicraft of the same weight class as in figure 3(c).Although position shifting can reduce delays, it is not always feasible to implement.For example, position shifting of two in-trail aircraft generally requires one airaft to overtake the other.This procedure increases controler workload, making position 518 shifting undesirable.Therefore, the scheduler has been designed to allow position shifting only if it can be tpleed before the posion-Shifted pair has merged on a common route.
Estimated Performance of SchedulerA study has been made to detmine the effect of the various s ng meods used in de TMA on aircraft delay.A full discussion is available in reference 8.In this study a taffic model was developed to simulae peak arrival taffic at the Denver Center.Traffic samples with a varying mix of heavy and large aircraft tpes were created PSentig an hour and a half of data.The curves shown are cumulative probability distributions for the average delay per aircrat The distributions are based on 2500 taffic samples each, with a taffic density of 40 aircraft per hour.The model assumes a rectagular probability distnbution for aicraft arrival times at the Center boundary.The resulting distibutions shown in the figue are for a 50% heavy, 50% taffic mix.It can be seen that both time advance and position shift prvide approximately equal, incremental reductions m average delay per aircraft, compared to the FCFS scheduler.Note that because the distributions are not symmetrical the mean delay per aircraft does not fall at the 50% point These curves show the best possible mix of taffic in terms of reducing delays.With a more typical traffc mix of aircraft types the reduction in delay per aicraft would be smaller.The average delay distnbutions are very sensitive to the arrival distribution and winds.Assuming a triangular instead of a rectangular distribuon neary doubles te average delay.A 20 knot headwind has nearly the same effect Lastly, it was shown that decreasing the required inter-aircraft spacing by even small amounts has a large effect on reding Xt average delay.
Description of Graphical Interface and ToolsThe interface for the TMA is based upon exploiting the interaction between workstation screen and the mouse.The workstation screen is divided into severl areas or windows.The largest area displays aircraft arrival schedules on several reconfgurable time lines.Another window gives an overview of traffic in the Center in a miniature plan view display (PVD).Other windows give statu infomation nd allow the modification of varous scheduling parameters such as the aiport acceptance rate and the configuration of the time lines.An additional pop-up or ovalapping window is available for displaying information about the schedule such as the currently selected acceptance rate, avenage and peak delays, and various data on indiviual airraft which the controller can select by picking the arcraft time line tag.The time line window contains a number of time lines on which three types of ime schedules can be selectively displayed: (1) ETAs of aircraft that have not yet entered the Center airspace; such ETAs are contained in flight plans sent to the Center ahead of time;(2) ETAs of aircraft tracked by the Center radars and sent to the TMA by the DA's at various controUer ations; and (3) STAs of all aircraft which will be or have been sent to the various controller stains.(A line drawing of the famat of the timelines can be seen in figure 5.) These time scedules can be selectively displayed on both the left and right side of each time line.Furthrore, the display of these time schedules can also be segregated by arival area through use of toggle switches in the control panel window.Aircraft time schedules move toward the bottom of their respective dme lines as time increases.An aircraft first appears on the flight-plan time line at the time the Center receives its flight plan and planned ETA.When the arcraft becomes active in the Center airspace, its ETA is updated and it is simultaneously removed from the flight plan time line and displayed on the ETA time line.Finally, when its ETA pentrates the scheduling horizon, its STA is computed and then displayed on the STA time line.Color coding of aircraft IDs and graphical markers are used on the time lines to convey the aircraft scheduling status and critical scheduling parameters.At the time the ETA of an aircraft falls below the freeze horizon its scheduled time is sent to an appropriate PVD for display on the PVD time line.Interaction with time lines-Of particular importance to the implementation of the TMA was the requirement that the traffic manager be able to interact with the automatic scheduler.The T MA intkfe has been structured to allow traffic managers considerable flexibility in modifying the computer generated schedule for specific aircraft, while allowing the automatic scheduler to continue generating schedules for the other eligible aircraft Also of imporance is the immediate feedback available to the traffr manager when he or she does modify the computer plan.The computer immediately modifies the scheduled aircraft display to reflect the taflic manager's input, making it easy to see the effect of his/her actions.Some of the ways in which the traffic manager can interat with the auomatic scedule will now be covered.In the following explantions, frequent reference will be Manual scbeduling-The traffic manager can alter the scheduled time of any aicaft currently in the system (including those which have not yet been scheduled, and those whose times are afready frozen).Ts is done by pling the moum cursor over the aircraft time line tag, depssing the middle button of the the-button mouse used in Sun worknkions and dragging the tag to a new location (time) on the time line.As soon as the middle button is released, fte computer will generate and display an updated schedule.Aircraft scheduled in this fashion am displayed in purple to highlight the fact that they have been manually scheduled by the controller.In the fiugwe both PAOOI and SP404 have been manually 519 46..
