Introductionne of the problems facing NextGen planners is that concepts such as trajectory-based operations need a means to determine the priority in which aircraft will be served when there is a conflict in who has priority over the use of national airspace capacity.For example, if two flights are scheduled to arrive at the same point at the same time, which flight takes priority, while the other either waits or takes an alternate path?The Joint Planning and Development Office's NextGen Institute conducted a study of flight prioritization in 2011 that examined how this might be accomplished. 1One concept presented to the Institute's study team was to use a point system where operators could accumulate points and use them to obtain priority for flights that they valued highly. 2 However, there was no consensus on how to make the initial allocation of points to carriers for use in the system.Prior research has suggested that the allocation of scarce National Airspace System (NAS) capacity could be improved if aircraft operators were able to exchange the priority in which their flights are handled by the air traffic control system to reflect how much they value timeliness for their fleet and specific aircraft operations. 3The current allocation system is largely based on first-come first-served as a priority mechanism, where aircraft are sequenced by the time they take-off or reach landing queues or as they move into new enroute airspace centers and sectors.During work on the JPDO NextGen Institute's flight prioritization study, carriers made it clear that they did not favor pure market based allocation systems for flights.They believed these would favor the larger and more profitable carriers, which have the resources to outbid smaller competitors for priority in congested airspace.These concerns may be based on their experience with buy-sell systems for airport slots.
A. Problem DefinitionIt is not possible for the ATC system managers to know the current status of each flight in advance, such as when it will actually be ready to depart.They also do not know the priorities operators place on the value of specific flights, and how these change over the day and from day to day.Without up-to-the-minute input from operators about their real priorities, the NAS cannot deliver the levels of service they desire for individual flights, therefore likely producing suboptimal results for operators and their customers.The Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) process employed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the airspace user community has allowed users to play a larger role in determining the order in which their aircraft are served if required to meet a business or operational necessity, but there is still significant room for automation and improvement. 4Nonetheless, ATC system managers face the complex tradeoff among basic demand capacity imbalances (which are often exacerbated by weather), the need to treat operators fairly (the concept of equity is important to users) and the need for a decision framework as more automation is introduced.Procedures that allow one operator to exchange priorities among its own flights have been initiated under the CDM programs conducted between FAA and the aircraft operators.A carrier that is not able to operate a flight under the first-come-first-served (FCFS) priority that it has can exchange places among its own flights or release a specific place in the queue without moving to the end of the line through slot credit substitution.However, this system does not allow the explicit exchange of flight priorities among aircraft operators.For example, a feeder flight into a hub with a large number of international connecting passengers might be valued more by Operator A than a domestic flight by a non-hubbing carrier operating to the same airport (Operator B).Operator B may be willing to help Operator A to move its operation ahead of Operators B's flight, and Operator B may be willing to accept this swapping of flight times.Current CDM procedures do not allow this type of exchange.
B. Research GapsResearchers have explored a number of possible priority point allocation systems to more closely align demand and capacity.Most allocation systems were applied at the airport level and employ techniques such as auctions or voting to develop a more efficient and equitable system.Past research has suggested a priority points-based system could improve NAS performance, where operators were awarded points based on their need for or use of NAS services.The points system would be a way for operators to establish priority, while retaining some efficiency aspects of a buy-sell system as well as addressing equity considerations among operators at the same time.If this results in a more efficient and equitable allocation of resources, the question of how to design such a system comes to the fore.Some users have expressed concerns that the operator with the deepest pockets would be able to control the priority system.In a recent study of alternative methods for flight prioritization, operators were concerned that monetary exchanges would not preserve enough capacity for smaller or less financially strong operators. 5In the absence of a market allocation method, researchers have proposed systems that share some attributes of a market system.One of the more interesting proposals that have emerged in the flight prioritization literature is the use of a point system instead of a pure buy/sell market transaction for flight priorities. 6A recent paper brings together work on using virtual queues to manage first come first served departure priority, which would reduce airfield congestion and improve performance.Points were awarded to operators who then used and exchanged them to establish take off priority for selected flights. 7While it is recognized that any system of exchange would allow more efficient outcomes, a major question has been how to allocate the priority points among operators.This paper reviews alternative allocation methods and shows how each performs in simulated exchanges by individual operators.A system where users could exchange priorities in a market or by other means would generally improve the allocation of resources among all users.Prior research has shown that allowing users to express priority for flights before they depart can reduce system-wide delays. 8Such a system can also result in a more efficient and equitable distribution of delays among users.This type of system can be operated under a buy/sell concept where users could exchange priorities based on a market transaction among operators.In other words, Operator A would offer to pay Operator B to allow its flight to depart first (assuming B was ahead in the queue based on first come first served).Such a system could also work using surrogates for money.In these mechanisms once an initial distribution of resources is made, operators can exchange these resources among or within themselves to achieve an efficient outcome.One concern that has emerged about the use of a point system is how the initial allocation of points would be made.In this paper, data on the utilization of NAS resources for individual flights are used to develop point systems that reflect both NAS usage and measures of the value of flights to airlines and consumers.Some researchers suggest that a points system would be perceived as more equitable and would not necessarily allow the financially strongest operator to control the priority system.While it is recognized that any system of exchange would allow more efficient outcomes, the initial allocation of points among operators determines whether most operators view the system as fair or equitable.This paper reviews alternative allocation methods and shows how each performs in simulated exchanges among carriers.Human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations were run previously, using subject matter experts in the role of dispatchers assigning points among operators.These generally show that a points system can be used and that it would reduce delays and may improve the allocation of NAS priorities in an equitable and acceptable manner. 9The purpose of this research is to experiment with different systems of awarding priority points, and then simulating the possible outcomes in terms of delay as operators use points to gain priority on air traffic control resources for flights they value highly.
II. Research ApproachThis section describes how the data were assembled for the initial awarding of points and for use in the simulations of operator behavior.The days selected for analysis were: 8/24/2005, 8/5/2010, 8/12/2010, 9/16/2010, 10/7/2010, 10/21/2010, 5/13/2011 and 7/7/2011.These reflect dates for which NASA had run simulations for delay computations with flight priorities in the past, allowing this new research to take advantage of data already in hand.Simulations of traffic based on recorded schedules for those eight days was used as the baseline first-come-firstserved case.The simulation is developed for domestic airspace using flights over the Continental United States (CONUS).Airspace is divided into two broad types: Terminal (below a certain altitude within a certain distance in the vicinity of airports) and Enroute.Enroute airspace is further classified by the FAA as follows:1. Domestic airspace is that over CONUS, plus Alaska and Hawaii.2. Oceanic airspace are those portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, plus the Gulf of Mexico, for which the United States provides a reduced set of air traffic control services.3. Foreign airspace is that for which FAA does not provide air traffic control services.Figure 1 shows the airspace boundaries of FAA enroute centers.Red lines show the boundaries of Domestic airspace centers.Blue lines show the limits of Oceanic airspace.Areas outside these lines are foreign airspace.or Mexico outside the domestic zone are international, as are flights to U.S. territories. Overflight-flights with no terminus in CONUS, but which fly through U.S. airspace.The assignment of geographies was done in order to eliminate flights which were assumed to not participate in a points-based priority system.Previous work indicates that non-participants in CDM systems are not significantly impacted. 10Current CDM programs conducted by the FAA are limited to flights by U.S. operators within CONUS.The analysis was therefore restricted to the domestic geography.
III. Data Analysis
A.Selection ProcessThe data developed for this study are based on flight segment record data from FAA's Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS). 11The Air Traffic Laboratory (ATA-100) provided boundary crossing file (BCF) records for each flight in the National Airspace System.A flight segment for this purpose is one aircraft traveling through one Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), so a flight which travels through three ARTCCs would consist of three records (assuming a boundary crossing record for each).These segment records were assembled into complete flights.The analysis dataset was further refined as follows: Flights conducted by military operators are excluded from results. Using a database of aircraft characteristics, fields were appended to each record for the number of seats and the payload of the aircraft used for the flight.Seats are based on the most common passenger configuration.Payload is either a known value for that model or calculated as 13.5% of Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW), which has been found to be a reasonable estimate. 12Table 1 shows a summary of the four activity measures, by geography, for the eight study days.The table has counts of flights, flight miles, available seat miles (ASMs) and available ton miles (ATMs), plus averages of flight miles, seats, ASMs and ATMs for each flight in domestic airspace.The analysis used eight days of ETMS flight data.The individual days were examined for delay as shown in Table 2 below using data from FAA's Operations Network (OPSNET).The day from 2005 has the highest number of operations (flights), but relatively low total and average delays when compared to the days from 2010.The majority of delays are weather related, and occur during August and September of 2010.Table 3 shows flight activity for the Air Traffic Services Business Model (ATSBM) 13 operator groups for the eight simulation days.The flights in the ATSBM are assigned to user types at a much greater level of detail than in the basic ETMS flight record or other FAA activity counting systems such as OPSNET or the Air Traffic Activity Data System (ATADS).Although scheduled commercial operators and their regional airline partners conduct a large percentage of the flights in the NAS, there are also many other types of flights.Government agencies operate aircraft, and there are many aircraft used for private purposes (known as general aviation) owned by individuals and organizations.However, only commercial and larger business aircraft operators participate in the CDM programs.Operator groups corresponding to commercial aviation with turbine-engine aircraft are highlighted in green.These represent the portion of air traffic potentially participating in the points-based system.Fortunately, these operators can be individually identified in the flight data with a carrier code field.
Table 1. Domestic Airspace Activity Table 2. Flights by Day and Reported Delay Levels
B.Flights and Point Allocation ParametersFlights were assigned to six four-hour time blocks, as shown in Table 4, based on UTC time of departure, and points were developed for each measure of activity.The assignment of time blocks was done in order to be able to eliminate flights occurring outside of peak travel times.This allowed confirmation that peaking occurred in the data is as observed in actual traffic.Because congestion is concentrated during these times, analysis was restricted to the hours in time block 6 (in Table 4) since it has greatest competition for NAS resources among users.A subset of the ATSBM data was used to develop the enhanced dataset relevant to the study.The enhanced dataset was used to develop measures of activity on which a points system could be based.The most straightforward measure of activity is a count of flights.From the perspective of equity, this measure is appealing, since operators are credited the same for every flight conducted, regardless of distance or aircraft size.A second possible measure is miles flown.Points credited increase linearly with the distance between origin and destination.Because the purpose of a flight is to transport passengers and cargo, it can be argued that a flight transporting them over greater distance provides a larger benefit to society/operator than a shorter flight.(Operators of long distance flights could also experience more competition for NAS resources.)From that perspective, it could also be helpful to take aircraft size into account, because a larger aircraft transports more passengers or cargo over any given distance.Measures that incorporate the size of the aircraft are: Available Seat Miles-aircraft seats multiplied by miles flown; and, Available Ton Miles-aircraft payload in tons, multiplied by miles flown.The aircraft database used for the analysis has both seat counts and payload by aircraft model.Thus, it was possible to calculate both ASM and ATM values for each flight, regardless of whether it was a passenger or allcargo operation.Points were calculated for four measures of activity, by time block, for each en route center.The measures were: flight count, flight miles (great circle distance between center entry and exit points), ASMs and ATMs.In addition, a carrier superset-a list of all those carriers which were in the top 40 (by flight count) in at
Table 3. Total Activity in Domestic Airspace for Eight Study Days Table 4. Four-Hour Time Blocksleast one center over the eight days studied-was developed.Tables of activity and points (flight count, miles, ATMs) for each center by carrier and time block were produced.Tables of activity and points for the peak travel time block for each of the superset carriers were produced.Values were averages (total for the eight study days, divided by eight), which were used to calculate points for the simulation.The four measures of activity (flight count, O-D flight miles, ASMs, and ATMs) were summed by carrier, date and flight geography, and were used to develop formulas for assigning points based on activity.The analysis used only flights with "domestic" geography; i.e., those conducted within CONUS plus the exclusion zones in Canada and Mexico.
IV. Calculating Points by OperatorAs noted above, this research examined a number of possible ways of calculating and distributing points among carriers using objective measures of NAS usage.A set of related measures were calculated that could be used for flight prioritization based on data from the ATSBM. 14These start with tabulating the number of flights and assigning points based on the number of flights for each operator.The points to be allocated were calculated based on the distance over which a flight operates, which also represents a measure of the importance of that flight to the operator.A third measure was calculated, ASMs flown.This takes into account that a flight took place, how far it operated, and how many passengers could be carried. 15The fourth measure, based on ATMs for the aircraft, gave a measure that included cargo.The calculation of points used the following algorithms to produce results of a similar scale: Five points per flight  One point per 100 miles flown  Five points per 100,000 ASMs  One point per 1,000 ATMs The results of the calculations of the four metrics for top domestic operators are shown in Table 5.For each metric, the number of points and the percentage of total points this represents are shown.As can be seen, flightsbased measures result in a smaller percentage of points for operators of larger aircraft such as American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest and United airlines.Once flight distance is used, the largest carriers get a larger share of points, reflecting larger average flight segment lengths.The measures of seat miles and ton-miles result in very similar results and provide the largest share of points to the operators of the largest aircraft.Conversely, operators of smaller aircraft flying shorter distances such as the regional airlines (American Eagle, Expressjet, Mesa, Mesaba, etc.) and business aircraft (Flight Options and NetJets) received a larger share of points when the number of flights is used as the allocation measure.Four metrics were used in the simulations of how allocations would affect operator decisions, and the impacts on the NAS.Ton-miles were also used, even though highly correlated with seat miles for passenger carriers, because doing so provided a metric for cargo aircraft.
Table 5. Calculated Points for Top Domestic OperatorsTable 6 summarizes the points calculated under each method for the ATSBM carrier groups.In general, the points for the operators of the largest aircraft over the longest distances increase when using distribution methods that consider aircraft weight and distance flown.This applies to five groups: commercial passenger, commercial cargo, low cost passenger, foreign passenger and foreign freight flights.The other user types, including regional airlines, have a higher share of points when only the count of flights is used in the points allocation.
V. Modeling and Simulation
A.Simulation Set Up 1. NAS Simulation EnvironmentTo assess the usefulness of the proposed allocation methods, the Future Air traffic management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) 16 developed at NASA Ames Research Center was used.FACET is a modeling and analysis system developed to explore advanced Air Traffic Management concepts.It handles traffic information at various spatial levels in the NAS, from the ARTCC, the sub-regions called Sectors, to individual aircraft trajectories.FACET can be used as a playback, simulation or real-time data analysis system.The simulation mode allows the user to take traffic initial conditions from a certain time.It evolves the air traffic based on available intent, consisting of flight plans that provide origin, destination, route of flight, aircraft type, cruise speed, cruise altitude and take-off time.As far as NAS resource capacity constraints are concerned, any sector or airport that was used by any flight in the system was included in the NAS capacity data set.This data set represents all resources whose capacity constraints must be satisfied.For this study, the data set contained 974 sectors, and 905 airports.The FAA's Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) and OPSNET data were used to obtain the maximum departure and arrival values for each of the top 70 airports.Since the airport capacity statistics are available in 15-minute intervals only, and some airports reconfigure their runways to increase their departure or arrival rates, the observed maximum values are an estimate of the operational capacity of the top 70 airports.Airports outside of this set were assumed to have a default value of 13 departures and arrivals every 15 minutes.Similarly, the default sector capacities known as Monitor Alert Parameters (MAP) were taken from ETMS.
SimulationsFor each traffic dataset, the top 100 users were simulated as participants, and only their flights between the top 70 airports in the United States were used for metric evaluation.All of the other flights were included as background traffic, operating on their nominal flight plans and granted five points.Aircraft were flown along assigned routes and at each minute, capacity violations in the NAS were identified.Whenever a capacity violation arose, flights creating the imbalance were ranked by their points and the flight with the lowest point assignment was selected for rerouting.If no optional route was submitted or selection of optional routes caused another capacity violation, a systemimposed departure delay was assigned to the flight.The value of the system-imposed departure delay varied depending on the capacity violation.For sector congestion, a 5-minute ground delay was given, but a lower value may also be specified.For an airport capacity violation, a 15-minute delay or less was assigned.Given that airport capacities are evaluated every fifteen minutes, the assigned delay for an airport capacity violation was the necessary amount to reschedule the flight within the next 15-minute interval.This iterative process continued until no capacity violations occur.Then, the final point values for participant flights are decremented from their total point allocation.In today's air traffic operations, airport and sector capacity constraints may be violated.In contrast, all resource capacity constraints were strictly satisfied in the simulation.Thus, for each traffic dataset, a simulated baseline case of one filed route and equally prioritized flights, reflecting the current FCFS system, was taken as the representation of the current air traffic operations.This allowed the system to calculate delays with respect to the baseline simulation.
B.Simulation ResultsThe priority points assigned to operators were used in a human-in-the-loop simulation based on prior work. 17Three point measures were calculated for each operator: Flights, Flight Miles and Ton Miles.The simulations involved carriers using these priority points to sequence the flights that they wanted to have a priority for service, when the system could not serve all flights at their desired times.For example, a flights-based awarding of points provides relatively more points to those operators with the smallest aircraft.An allocation based on flight miles awards points to those operators with the longest flight segments, and the ton-mile based allocation gives relatively more points to those operators using the largest aircraft over the longest distances.The results of the simulation by carrier for August 12, 2010 are shown in Table 7. Similar results were observed on other days.As can be seen, the largest operators such as Delta, Southwest and American have longer delays in the flights-based point system because operators with small aircraft have the same priority on a flight basis.WestJet experienced an unusual delay (45 minutes) under the flights-based system, possibly due to a flight arriving at a more-congested time than it did under the other systems.These carriers have fewer delays and shorter average delays when miles and ton-miles, respectively, are used for the initial allocation of points.This illustrates how the initial points allocation method affects an operator's ability to use them to reduce the delays it incurs.
C. Results Summary Table 7. Delay Minutes by Operator under Alternative Point SystemsThe data in Table 8 summarize the delay simulation results by the operator groups.These confirm the results above, in that the groups operating larger aircraft over longer distances (Commercial Carrier Passenger and Low Cost Carriers) use the points in a way to have fewer delays under the systems which award points based on metrics that consider distance and the combination of distance and aircraft size.Conversely, the operators of smaller aircraft flying shorter distances have fewer delays in a system where the initial allocation is made using flights.Figure 2 shows the average delay data by operator group in a visual comparison of the allocation alternatives.It also shows the total number of flights by group.As above, the flights based point allocations favor the regional airlines and operators of small aircraft in that they are able to use the points to get the shortest average delays.The opposite effect is evident for the Commercial passenger carriers and Low Cost carrier groups.User groups with 120 (Part 135 Freight -Piston) or fewer flights do not exhibit any difference in delay among the three metrics.This simply reflects their having few flights, which were subject to little delay and so did not happen to be affected by the flight prioritization system.
VI. ConclusionsA concept of priority points was introduced in earlier research.In subsequent research, analysis of system delay performance was presented using assignment of points by aircraft operators in the National Airspace System.The aspect of initial allocation of points is presented here.This research shows that it is possible to examine the delay reduction potential of alternative flight prioritization methods using alternative allocation schemes.The research also shows that the initial allocation of points affects the outcomes in terms of how carriers use priority points to reduce delays for the flights they operate.Allocation methods that consider aircraft size and distance flown tend to award proportionally more points to the operators of larger aircraft.This carries through to the outcomes because carriers with more points tend to achieve average flight delay reductions.Systems that consider only the number of flights operated produce more points and greater delay reductions for operators of smaller aircraft.Future research should determine which allocation method produces the most socially desirable results.An important step would be assigning financial value to delay avoided.This value has two components: reduced aircraft operating cost, and value of passenger time saved.Hourly operating costs for aircraft used in commercial service are well-documented.Valuation of passenger travel time has been addressed in guidance from the Department of Transportation.It should therefore be relatively straightforward to develop reliable estimates of the potential cost savings among methods for awarding carrier points in a flight prioritization system.Downloaded by NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTRE on April 18, 2013 | http://arc.aiaa.org| DOI: 10.2514/6.2012-5542Flights are assigned to one of four "geographies," based on origin and destination:  Domestic-within an area consisting of the Continental United States (CONUS) plus southern Canada and northern Mexico.The domestic zone includes the parts of Canada and Mexico that are within 225 miles of the border with CONUS  Alaska/Hawaii-flights with one terminus in CONUS (but not the domestic zones of Canada or Mexico) and the other in Alaska or Hawaii. International-flights with one terminus in CONUS and one terminus in a foreign country.Fights to Canada
