Introductionhe continuous growth in the demand for air transportation results in an imbalance between airport capacity, airspace capacity and traffic demand.Airport arrival rates and airport departure rates are affected by weather conditions.The airspace capacity of a region depends on the ability of the system to maintain safe separation between aircraft in the region.The airspace capacity is severely limited by inclement weather.Similarly, airport arrival rates and airport departure rates are reduced in the presence of bad weather.FAA has a national center called Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) that oversees national traffic.Traffic managers at Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) collaborate with dispatchers at various Airlines' Operations Center (AOC) to mitigate the demand weather.The end result is the implementation of a set of Traffic Flow Management (TFM) initiatives such as ground delay programs, reroute advisories, flow metering, and ground stops.Data Mining is the automated process of analyzing large sets of data and then extracting patterns in the data.Data mining tools are capable of predicting behaviors and future trends, allowing an

Statistics of Ground Delay ProgramsThe mission of the FAA's traffic management system to balance traffic demand with system capacity is achieved through a variety of Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI) instituted and modified by traffic managers at the regional and national levels.The FAA developed the National Traffic Management Log (NTML) to provide a single system for automated coordination, logging, and communication of TMIs throughout the National Airspace System.Figures below show more detailed GDP event statistics from the data.displays the ratios in percentage between airport GDP counts and the total NAS GDP counts for the top 8 airports.It shows that the most frequent demand-capacity imbalances occurred at the airports in the northeast region of the United States, such as the three New York GA, and JFK), Philadelphia (PHL), and Boston Logan International Airport (BOS).The major cause of Ground Delay Programs is weather as demonstrated in .The diverse weather subcategory causes are presented in Fig. 2.

III. Data Mining OverviewIn our study, we use three data mining methods: ensemble bagging decision trees (BDT), neural network classifier and support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithms.These models were selected because decision surfaces modeled by these are very different from each other.As we do not have direct knowledge of shape of decision surface in the case of GDP decisions, it would be good to use different data mining methods to examine if the actual surface is easier modeled by one of these methods.
A. Ensemble Bagging Decision Tree ClassifierDecision tree learning 4 uses a decision tree as a predictive model that associates input variables with target values.Each internal node corresponds to a condition on an input variable; there are edges from the node to children for each of the possible values of that input variable.Each leaf node has a value of the target variable associated with it.This value is the predicted value given the values of the input variables represented by the path from the root of the tree to the leaf.Algorithm for creating decision trees works top-down by selecting a condition on a variable at each step that best splits the set of items.Algorithm used in this study used a metric called "Gini impurity."Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly classified if it were randomly classified according to the distribution of classes in the subset.Another commonly used measure is "information gain" measure.Ensemble methods use multiple machine learning models to obtain better predictive performance than what any of its individual constituent members can produce.Bagging is an ensemble method that uses random re-sampling of a dataset to construct models.
B. Neural Network ClassifierA feed-forward neural network 5 consists of input, hidden and output layers and provides a general framework for representing non-linear functional mapping between a set of input variables and a set of output variables.The output from each layer is connected to the next layer by modifiable weights represented by links between the layers.The weighted outputs from one layer will go through nonlinear sigmoid functions to form the input to the neuron in the next layer.A bias unit is connected to all neurons except the neurons in the input layer.The backpropagation algorithm based on minimizing the output error using a gradient descent method is used for training neural networks.For a NN to have good generalization properties and to avoid over-fitting, the training data should have 5 to 10 times training cases as the weights in NN and it should be statistically representative.
C. Support Vector MachineA support vector machine 1 constructs a hyper-plane or set of hyper-planes in a high-or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks.Its robust performance with respect to limited, sparse and noisy data is making it widely used in many applications from protein function, and face recognition, to text categorization for classification and regression prediction.The SVM model has also been utilized in airport capacity classification prediction.When used for binary classification, the SVM algorithm separates a given set of two-class training data by constructing a multidimensional hyper-plane that optimally discriminates between the two clusters.Although SVMs were originally proposed to solve linear classification problems, they can be applied to non-linear decision functions by using the so-called kernel function trick.Adopting this kernel technique, SVM can be utilized to automatically realize a non-linear mapping to a high dimensional space.The hyper plane in the high dimensional space corresponds to a non-linear decision boundary in the input space.A widely used kernel is the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF).
IV. MethodologyIn some applications, different operators may take different control actions in the presence of similar weather and traffic conditions.Sometimes, the same operator may take different control actions in the presence of similar weather conditions.The reasons for this may be various.Inconsistency may be owing to differing objectives, decision-making styles, or training.The degree of operator decision consistency varies in different regions of the state space.It can be useful to understand the nature of decision inconsistency.Furthermore, the performance of these data mining methods will vary depending on the state of the system as specified by the observations.The ability of machine learning depends on the consistency of the decision-making process and the availability of the training data in the various regions of the input data state space.Another factor complicating the analysis is lack of clear criterion driving the control actions resulting in different decisions for the same values of the state space.Given the variability in the performance of data mining methods, using a single number to characterize predictive accuracy is not helpful.The paper discusses how to divide data into regions with differing decision consistency and report performance of different data mining methods in the different regions of decision consistency.We will also examine if there is variation in the performance of different data mining methods.The general approach adopted in this learning automation work involves the following steps.We will also examine if there is variation in the performance of different data mining The general approach adopted in this learning automation work involves the following Division of data into regions of differing decision consistency Comparison of performance of three data mining methods in the regions of differing We will also examine if there is variation in the performance of different data mining The general approach adopted in this learning automation work involves the following data mining methods in the regions of differing to weather prediction inaccuracies

Segmentation of data into regions
D. Regions of differing decision consistencyFor the purpose of analysis, we divide the data into six regions as shown in fig. 4. Division is based on the values of sum of wind WITI and MC WITI.R1 is a region where the sum of MC WITI and wind WITI is the lowest.R6 is a region where the sum is the highest.Difficulty of deciding on control action depends on the region of variable space.For example, on clear weather days, most operators would not have any difficulty in concluding that there is no need for weather-caused GDP.Similarly, on a really bad weather day, most operators would conclude that there is a need for weather-caused GDP.Table 1 shows segmentation of data into 6 regions depending on the sum of Wind WITI and MC WITI and the probability of GDP occurrence in this region of data.Low is defined as [.50, .66],medium is defined as [.67, .82]and high as defined as [.83, 1.0].The number shown in the second column of the table is the percent of cases with GDPs in the particular region of interest.Decision consistency refers to percent of days when the decision was in agreement with the majority decision for the region.Fig. 5 shows GDP decisions and weather conditions for all days analyzed in this study.Each point in the plot corresponds to a day with IMC and wind values corresponding to it.The point is represented by "x" if there is no GDP on that day.It is represented by "o" if there is a GDP on that day.In the Fig. 5, three plots show the regions of high, medium and low decision consistency.As evident in the table 1 and Fig. 5, this value depends on the region of variable space.For example, the first row in table 1 corresponds to mostly clear weather days.In this case, most operators do not have any difficulty in concluding that there is no need of weather-caused GDP.On the other hand, the last row in the table corresponds to days with the worst weather.In this case, 92% of operators concluded that there is a need of weather-caused GDP.If we examine third row in the table, we find that about 38% of operator chose to implement GDPs and 62% chose not to.Operators probably need a decision support system in the cases where there seem to be divergence of control actions under the exact same conditions.Given the divergent characteristics of different regions, it would be useful to examine the performance of data mining methods in different regions of data space.
Figure 5. Differing Decision Consistency in Different RegionsWe categorized the six regions as having low, medium or high level of decision consistency and then compared performance of different methods when data has these differing levels of decision consistency.We found that about 33% of days fall in the category of low decision consistency.About 27% fall in the category of moderate decision consistency and about 40% of days fall in the category of high decision consistency.We also find that performance of data mining methods is better in the region of high decision consistency and is poorer in the region of low decision consistency.
E. Performance of different methods in the regions of differing decision consistencyAccuracy of these methods varies depending on region of decision consistency.For example, decision tree classifier had overall accuracy of 87% in the region of high decision consistency, an accuracy of 78% in the region of medium decision consistency and an accuracy of 67% in the region of low decision consistency.This is not surprising as data mining models can only be as good as the data on which they are trained on.Utility of data mining methods may vary in different regions of decision consistency.There is probably no need for data mining assistant system in the region of high decision consistency.Data mining methods can be useful in the regions of medium and low decision consistency, but their accuracy is the lowest in the region of low decision consistency.
F. Relevant Inaccuracies in Weather PredictionsA natural approach to determine whether weather prediction is inaccurate would be to use is using an arbitrary threshold for difference between predicted and actual weather parameters.For example, if difference in predicted wind speed and actual wind speed is 5 knots or more, prediction could be regarded as inaccurate.However, whether wind speed is 0 or 5 may not affect control decisions.In contrast, whether wind speed is 10 or 15 may influence GDP decisions under certain conditions.Our definition attempts to capture inaccuracies in weather prediction that are likely to have impact on control decisions.We create a decision tree predicting control decisions based on historical METAR data.Then, we use this tree to predict control decision first using available METAAR data.Then, we use the same tree to predict control decisions using available TAF data.If these two decisions are different, then we regard the weather prediction to be inaccurate.There were about 30% of days with significant weather accuracies with this definition.
G. Sensitivity of decision consistency regions to weather prediction accuracyIn this subsection, we examine the sensitivity of decision consistency regions to weather prediction accuracy.To do so, we divide the data into days when weather prediction is accurate and into days when weather prediction is not accurate.Table 3 shows that differing region of decision inconsistency exist even on days with correct weather prediction.Table 4 shows that there is a very high level of decision uncertainty on the days when weather predictions are inaccurate.
VI. ConclusionDifficulty of deciding on control action depends on the region of variable space.Weather and traffic signature on different days can be used to categorize these into days with little decision consistency, days with moderate decision consistency and days with high decision consistency.This paper reported performance of different data mining methods in the three regions of decision consistency.Not surprisingly, data mining methods have the best performance in the region of high decision consistency and have the poorest performance in the region of low decision consistency.In applications where data mining methods have differing performance in differing regions, it would be more useful to characterize region specific performance instead of characterizing performance by a single parameter.Also, there is probably not need for data mining assistant system in the region of high decision consistency.Operators may find decision support systems to be most useful in the regions of moderate or low decision consistency.Also, organizations may want to examine decision-making processes that are used in these regions to see how much subjectivity exists.Thus, it may be useful to segment data and identify regions of low and moderate decision consistency.Finally, we also found that there was not significant variation in the performance of different data mining methods for this particular problem.The fact that different mining methods show no significant variation also provides further confidence in the results of data mining methods.We also found that differing region of decision consistency exist even on days with correct weather prediction.On the other hand, there is a low level of decision consistency on the days when weather predictions are inaccurate.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.(a) GDP causes and
