II. IntroductionWhile flying simulated vehicles, pilots adapt to different stimuli provided in a simulator, e.g., out-the-window visual, audio, motion, and hand-controller force feedback, depending on the task or maneuver.Timely motion feedback through the motion platform, as well as feedback from the force-feel system, can provide lead compensation in closed-loop control tasks and improve handling qualities and task performance [1][2][3][4][5].Force-feel characteristics, such as the breakout, dead-band, damping, force gradient, and inertia of the controller all play an important role in the handling qualities of a (simulated) rotorcraft.Previous research focused on cyclic inceptor force-feel characteristics for improved handling qualities for both passive and active controllers [6][7][8].Different from previous investigations, this study investigated haptic cues that are missing in fixed-base flight simulators that could contribute to tactile feedback pilots would have experienced otherwise in real flight.Specifically, this study focused on the inertial forces and moments a cyclic inceptor experiences due to the aircraft's motion that are either missing completely in fixed-base flight simulators, or being attenuated due to the application of washout filters in motion-based simulators.In an experiment conducted in the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research Center, the effects on task performance, control behavior, and handling qualities ratings were investigated when restoring these reaction forces in fixed-base flight simulators.The paper is structured as follows: Section III mathematically derives the control force compensation missing in fixed-base simulation.Section IV provides an overview of the experiment setup, including verification of the dynamic models, and the experimental hypotheses.The results are presented in Section V and discussed in Section VI.Finally, conclusions are provided in Section VII.
III. Control Force CompensationThe inertial force from the dynamics of the simulated rotorcraft's lateral acceleration, a y , and roll angular acceleration, p b , Fig. 1a, are translated through the center control stick to the pilot as shown in Fig. 1b for the lateral and roll degrees-of-freedom.The equations of motion of the lateral stick response due to the simulated rotorcraft's lateral and roll angular accelerations are described by Eqs. 1 and 2 as a function of control force-feel system damping, ζ y , and force gradient, k y .I xx φ a y = -m c a y r c -ζ y φ a y -k y φ a y(1)I xx φ pbd = -I xx p b -ζ y φ pbd -k y φ pbd(2)The lateral stick displacements, due to lateral accelerations, a y , and angular accelerations, p b , are defined by Eqs. 3 and 4, respectively.Φ a y = - m c r c I xx a y / s 2 + ζ y I xx s + k y I xx(3)Φ pbd = -p b / s 2 + ζ y I xx s + k y I xx(4)The total compensation for the lateral control, Φ c , or what is missing in a fixed-based simulation is the sum of these two dynamic components as shown in Eq. (5).Φ c can be added to the control trim position to move the lateral stick in addition to pilot control inputs to simulate the stick force response due to the inertial force and moment from the rotorcraft's dynamics.Φ c = Φ a y + Φ pbd(5)
IV. Experiment SetupTo investigate if control force compensation affects pilot control behavior and performance, a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) lateral side-step task was developed in the VMS with the aim to compare results from no-motion conditions with and without control force compensation.The results were further compared with data from a near one-to-one motion condition, and a medium-fidelity motion condition representing motion found in typical hexapod motion simulators.
A. Rotorcraft DynamicsA simulated linear 2-DOF rotorcraft model was adopted from previous work investigating the effects of roll-lateral motion on pilot performance [3].The simulated rotorcraft model is provided in Eqs.6 and 7.φ = -4.5 φ + 1.7δ lat (6) v = g sin φ(7)A second rotorcraft model, a full nonlinear UH-60 model [9] with a heavier force gradient of the lateral stick, was also used to investigate if there is a different effect from control force compensation depending on the controlled dynamics.For the UH-60, the Stability Augmentation System (SAS) was turned off purposely with an intent to force pilots to maintain close-loop stability.A comparison of the agility of the two rotorcraft models is shown in Fig. 2.
B. Control Force-Feel SystemTo determine the mass and moment of inertia of the control stick in Eqs.1-5, a pull test was conducted by setting the damping of the stick to zero and releasing the stick at its maximum lateral travel limit.The force gradient of the linear model was set to 0.6 lbf/in as in a previous test [3].The resulting undamped natural frequency of the stick, ω n , was measured at 1.194 Hz (or 7.5 rad/s).Using Eq. ( 1), with zero external force and zero damping based on a 25 inches rotational reference center for the particular control loader system, the moment of the inertia of the lateral stick was calculated from Eqs. 8 to be 2577 lbm-in about the lateral stick's rotational center.The effective damping ratio of the stick would come out to be 0.85.With these properties, the stick's lateral characteristics would be acceptable according to Ref. [8].A check of the pull-release response of the measured moment inertia vs. the lateral stick response from the simulator is shown in Fig. 3.ω n = k y /I xx or I xx = k y /ω 2 n (8)The product of mass and the rotational center to the center of c.g. of the stick, m c r c in Eq. (3), was estimated through an experimental process since it was difficult to disassemble the roll rotational assembly from the control loader system.The VMS was configured with near one-for-one motion by setting the second-order high-pass washout filter frequencies for both the roll and lateral degree of freedom (DOF) to 0.001 rad/s with a unity gain.A doublet of lateral acceleration was commanded to drive the motion system.By comparing the stick displacement response and the compensation model, m c r c , is estimated to be 52 lb min 2 .With this estimate, the resulted lateral stick displacement compensation shows a good match to the simulator response as shown in Fig. 4. The compensation due to a roll angular acceleration also shows a good match as shown in the same figure.The lateral stick's control-force feel for the UH-60 had a breakout force of 1 lbf, a damping ratio of 0.722, and a force gradient of 1 lbf/in, which resulted an undamped natural frequency of 9.7 rad/s.This would also be acceptable according to Ref. [8].
C. TaskA 20-foot side-step task was developed to investigate the effect of the control force compensation to the stick due to the lateral accelerations and roll angular accelerations in ground-based flight simulators.Altitude hold, heading hold, as well as forward position hold were assumed to be active to limit the DOFs to roll and lateral only as defined by the model described in Eqs. 1 and 2.All test participants were briefed on the test procedures and task performance criteria prior to taking the test.Test participants were instructed to initiate a smooth lateral input toward the station-keeping position 20 feet to the right in 5 seconds (or time-to-target) for desired performance, and 7 seconds for adequate performance.Once the simulated rotorcraft was visually within the desired station-keeping region, test participants were directed to maintain the station-keeping position in a light disturbance for 10 seconds.Desired, adequate, and not-adequate performance criteria for the station-keeping phase of the task were given to the test participants as shown in Fig. 5.
D. ConditionsTo investigate the effect of inertial stick force compensation and its interaction with aircraft dynamics, the experiment had two independent variables: motion fidelity with four levels (high-fidelity, medium-fidelity, low-fidelity, and low-fidelity with compensation) and rotorcraft model with two levels (linear and UH-60 dynamics).The experiment had a full-factorial design resulting in eight experimental conditions.The motion configurations were plotted against the modified Sinacori motion fidelity criteria [3] are shown in Fig. 6.The motion gain for the high-fidelity configuration was reduced from unity to 0.8 to alleviate excessive lateral accelerations from the UH-60 model.The test matrix is shown in Table 1.
E. Participants and ProceduresSeven pilots participated in the experiment.All had extensive rotorcraft flying experience.Every pilot received an extensive briefing and safety-walk-around before the start of the experiment.The original experiment was divided into two sessions.Each session tested the experimental conditions for one rotorcraft model.Training was provided to all test participants at the beginning of each session.Six simulated runs of each test configurations were given to test participants in random order.However, due to an error in the implementation of the control force compensation, the low-fidelity conditions were repeated by the seven test participants several weeks after the first trial of testing.During the second trial of testing, the low-fidelity conditions were presented randomly in two sessions as well.The two motion conditions were not repeated.
F. ApparatusThe VMS, Fig. 7a, with its large motion envelope provides the realistic cueing environment necessary for performing handling qualities studies, has an operational lateral travel of 30 feet.The simulator was positioned to the left-side of the
G. Dependent MeasuresThe experiment considered two subjective handling qualities ratings (HQR) [10] as dependent measures: the HQR rating during the transnational phase of the task (HQR tr ans ) and the HQR rating during the station keeping phase (HQR sk ).These ratings were collected in separate runs for conditions 1, 3, and 4 only at the end of the experiment.The HQR were collected only for the linear model.The following eight objective performance variables were considered as dependent measures: the time-to-target, t g ; the root mean square (RMS) of pilots' control inputs, RMS u ; the bandwidth of the control inputs, ω c f [11]; the station keeping score, SK; the RMS of the lateral position and velocity during the station-keeping phase, RMS ye and RMS v ; and the RMS of the roll angle and rate during the station-keeping phase, RMS φ and RMS p respectively.The time-to-target, t g , was the time between two button presses on the center stick.Pilots pressed the event button the first time when they were ready to start transitioning to the hover target.They pressed the button a second time when they felt they were within the desired hover bound and would likely stay in the desired area.Both ω c f and RMS u were calculated for the entire run, i.e., for both the translation and the station-keeping phases.The station-keeping score, SK, ranged from 1 to 3. A score of 1 was given to desired performance achieved during the station-keep phase of the task, 2 was given to adequate performance, and 3 was given to not-adequate performance (Fig. 5).The remaining objective measures (RMS ye , RMS v , RMS φ , and RMS p ) were all calculated for the station-keeping phase only.The lateral position error, RMS ye , was calculated relative to the center of the hover-target board (Fig. 5).
H. HypothesesThe following hypotheses were formulated based on the characteristics of the control force compensation as derived in Section III and the controlled dynamics presented in Section IV.A: H1: Since the control force compensation in the fixed-base condition is simulating the inertial force and moment feedback due to the motion of the simulated aircraft, it was expected that pilots performing the task with compensation would control more similarly to performing the task under medium-fidelity or high-fidelity motion compared to performing the task without compensation.This would be visible in ω c f and RMS u .H2: As the control force compensation provides lead information similar to motion feedback, albeit less efficient, it was expected that the compensation would result in improved task performance compared to the fixed-base condition without compensation, i.e., a shorter time-to-target t g ; smaller RMS of the lateral position error RMS ye , roll angle RMS φ , lateral velocity RMS v , and roll rate RMS p during the station-keeping task; and a better station-keeping score SK.H3: Since the higher force gradient of the UH-60 model would result in a smaller magnitude of force compensation at the stick, it was hypothesized that pilots controlling the UH-60 model would benefit less from the control force compensation as compared to the linear model, i.e., the performance improvement would be less for the UH-60 model compared to the linear model and control behavior would be more similar to the condition without compensation.H4: It was expected that both high-fidelity and medium-fidelity motion would still provide larger improvements in pilot performance compared to both low-fidelity conditions, as motion provides faster lead information as compared to haptic feedback.Therefore, performance in the low-fidelity condition with compensation was expected to lie between performance in the medium-fidelity and low-fidelity-without-compensation conditions.
V. ResultsIn this section, the main results of the experiment and the associated data analysis are presented.The seven continuous dependent measures under consideration are: t g , RMS u , ω c f , RMS ye , RMS v , RMS φ , RMS p .The three ordinary variables considered are the performance score SK and the HQR rating for the translation and station keeping phases, respectively.Table 2 and Table 3 present the means and standard deviations of the dependent measures for each condition with the exception of the HQR ratings, which deviated strongly from normality.Table 4 provides the means of the data collapsed over the rotorcraft models for the same dependent measures.
A. Ordinal Variables
HQR RatingsThe participants were asked to subjectively evaluate the handling qualities of the linear model using the Cooper Harper rating.They were asked to rate the translation and station keeping phase of the task separately (HQR tr ans and HQR sk , respectively).The assigned scores ranged from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating the best handling characteristics and 10 the worst [10].The pilot responses are shown in Figs.8a and8b.The Jonckheere trend test [12] was used to test the hypothesis that high-fidelity motion would receive the lowest scores, followed by the fixed-base condition with compensation, followed by the fixed base condition without compensation, in this order.The results of the test show a non-significant trend: JT = 57, p = 0.1304.Furthermore, a generalized linear model based on Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE based on logistic regression) was fit to the data, using   the Gaussian family and as cluster variable the participant ID.The planned contrasts for the model compared the high fidelity case against the low-fidelity ones and the low-fidelity cases with and without compensation against each other.For the variable HQR tr ans , the first contrast shows that there is no significant difference between high-fidelity and (combined) low-fidelity conditions.The same holds for the difference between the low fidelity with compensation and without.For the variable HQR sk , the first contrast shows that there is no significant difference between high-fidelity and (combined) low-fidelity conditions.The same hold for the difference between the low-fidelity with compensation and without.The full test results are shown in Table 5.The means and standard errors of the aggregated data are summarized in Table 6.
Station-Keeping Score, SKThe station-keeping score, or SK, ranged from 1 to 3. A score of 1 indicates desired performance during the station-keep phase of the task, 2 indicates adequate performance, and 3 indicates not-adequate performance as shown in Fig. 5.The data, aggregated over motion-fidelity and aircraft-model variables, are shown in histograms in Fig. 9. Since the data are ordinal and highly non-normal a generalized linear model based on Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE based on logistic regression) was fit to the data, using the Poisson family with logarithmic link function and as cluster variable the participant id.The summary of the statistical results derived from the model are shown in Table 7.The rotorcraft model suggestively affected the score; b = -0.077,χ 2 = 3.308, p = 0.069.The mean SK rating for the UH-60 model (M = 1.25) was lower than for the linear model (M = 1.35).
B. Continuous VariablesFor the continuous variables linear regression models were used for hypothesis testing, having as independent within-subject variables the simulation fidelity (Fidelity) and aircraft model (Model).First, a repeated-measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the continuous variables.Unfortunately, most fidelity conditions violated the assumption of homogeneity of variances of the residuals.For this reason, a linear mixed-effect model was fit for all the continuous variables since it does not assume homogeneity of variances of the residuals and can account for the residual dependency by using the pilot ID as a random factor [13]. Adding pilot ID as the random factor significantly improved every model that is discussed further.To compare specific conditions without correcting for multiple comparisons, orthogonal constants where used [14].The orthogonal contrasts considered were the same for all the conditions: 1) High fidelity vs. others compares the mean of the high-fidelity against the aggregate mean of the all the other conditions.2) Medium fidelity vs. low compares the mean of the medium-fidelity condition against the aggregate mean of both the low-fidelity conditions.3) Low fidelity with vs. without compensation compares the mean of the low-fidelity condition with and without compensation.The analysis of variance test results are summarized in Table 8.The overall effect sizes are tabulated in Table 9 to    Table 14, and represented graphically in Figs. 10 and11.
Time-to-Target, t gThe error-bar plot of the time-to-target for each of the conditions can be seen in Fig. 10a.The summary of the linear mixed effect model is provided in Table 9.The different aircraft models did not have a significant effect on the time-to-target.The time-to-target was significantly lower between the medium-fidelity (M = 4.38) and the low-fidelity conditions (M = 4.6 s); b = -0.115(SE = 0.048), t(29.3)= -2.401,p = 0.023.
Cut-Off Frequency, ω c fThe error-bar plot Of the control input cut-off frequency for each of the conditions can be seen in Fig. 10b.The summary of the linear mixed-effect model is shown in Table 10.There was a significant interaction effect between the rotorcraft model type and the high-fidelity vs. other contrast; b = -0.137(SE = 0.044), t(18) = -3.146,p = 0.006.As can be seen in Fig. 10b at low-and medium-fidelity conditions, the cut-off frequency for the UH-60 was systematically higher than the one for the linear model while for the high fidelity case this difference disappeared.The cut-off frequency was significantly higher with high-fidelity compared to the other conditions; b = 0.417 (SE = 0.045), t(28, 22) = 9.336, p < 0.001.Moreover, the cut-off frequency for the low-fidelity condition with compensation (M = 2.71 rad/s) was significantly higher than the one for the low fidelity condition without compensation (M = 2.46 rad/s); b = 0.231 (SE = 0.109), t(18) = -3.146,p = 0.044.
RMS Control Input, RMS uThe error-bar plot of time-to-target for each of the conditions is depicted in Fig. 10c.The summary of the linear mixed effect model is shown in Table 11.There was a significant interaction between the aircraft model and the mediumvs.low-fidelity conditions; b = -0.057(SE = 0.023), t(18) = -2.466,p = 0.024.Even in presence of an interaction, the overall mean of the RMS u for the linear model (M = 0.529) was significantly higher than the one for the UH-60 (M = 0.436); b = -0.093(SE = 0.034), t(6) = -2.744,p = 0.034.The RMS u for the high-fidelity case (M = 0.37) is lower than the one for the medium (M = 0.44) and low fidelity cases (M = 0.56), although the effect is not significant, p = 0.055.
RMS Lateral Position Error, RMS yeThe error-bar plot of the RMS lateral position error for each of the conditions can be seen in Fig. 11a.The summary of the linear mixed effect model is provided in Table 12.The RMS ye for the linear model (M = 1.66) was significantly higher than the RMS ye for the UH-60 model (M = 1.33); b = -0.311(SE = 0.038), t(5.94) = -3.2,p = 0.019.Furthermore, the statistical analysis reveals that the mean RMS ye of low fidelity with compensation (M = 1.45) was significantly lower than the one of the same fidelity but without compensation (M = 1.7); b = -0.0252(SE = 0.094), t(35.62)= -2.691,p = 0.011.Indeed, for the UH-60 the means for the low fidelity case with (M = 1.429) and without compensation (M = 1.434) were quite similar.On the other hand, for the linear case the means for the low fidelity case with (M = 1.465) and without compensation (M = 1.970) showed a difference.
B. SummaryThe rotorcraft model introduced significant differences in the dependent measures.These differences were probably caused by the fact that the linear model had a responsive first-order rate response, while the UH-60 model had a somewhat unsteady rate command response by purposely turning off the SAS to force pilots to stay in the loop to expose the effect of the controller compensation.This, however, might unexpectedly have led to pilots staying low-gain during the station-keeping phase.In addition, the higher force gradient of the control inceptor in the UH-60 resulted in smaller force compensations relative to the linear model with a lower force gradient.With the combination of these two factors, the benefit of having the lead provided by the force compensation was found to be significantly reduced with the UH-60 model as observed by comparing the control input cut-off frequency and lateral position error between the low-fidelity conditions with and without the force compensation.The contrast comparing the high-fidelity condition with the rest of the fidelity conditions, and its interactions showed significant differences in the following variables: ω c f , RMS u , RMS v , RMS φ .Pilots had a higher control input cut-off frequency for the motion conditions.This might be a result of the enhanced lead information motion provides as shown by previous studies [1][2][3][4][5].In this case, the simulation cueing feedback from the visual and motion were consistent with little to no phase error between them.Even though not significant, the lower RMS u for motion conditions compared to the conditions without motion could suggest a lower control activity with motion.Furthermore, motion resulted in lower values for RMS v and RMS φ , indicating that pilots could more easily stabilize the aircraft with motion.The medium-fidelity motion condition introduced significant differences compared to both low-fidelity conditions for t g and RMS u .The time-to-target t g is lower for the medium-fidelity motion condition, even though t g for the high-fidelity condition is not significantly different from the rest.Since the time-to-target was measuring the time of a 20-feet sidestep to the hover target, which involved taking out the lateral velocity before stabilizing and hovering, the medium-fidelity motion was able to provide the comfort for pilots to generate a larger bank, or lateral acceleration, to get to the hover target and with the right amount of damping needed to stabilize the simulator via the motion feedback.The RMS control input RMS u was also different for the medium-fidelity motion condition compared to the other conditions due to an interaction with the aircraft model: for the UH-60, RMS u was significantly lower than in the low-fidelity cases, while for the linear model it was comparable to the low-fidelity conditions.This could have been caused by the UH-60's unsteady rate command system allowing motion feedback to provide the damping in the pilot's inner-loop control behavior.The comparison between the low-fidelity condition with and without compensation found significant differences for the following variables: ω c f , RMS ye , RMS v , RMS φ .Even though the interaction effect is not significant (p = 0.07), the compensation algorithm seems to mostly increase the cutoff frequency for the linear model leaving ω c f almost unchanged across the two conditions for the UH-60 model.A significant interaction effect was found for RMS ye and RMS v : when pilots controlled the linear model, the RMS of the lateral deviation and velocity were significantly lower for the condition with compensation.On the other hand, for conditions with the UH-60 model, RMS ye and RMS v were almost unaffected across the two conditions.This is likely due to the fact that the UH-60 had an unsteady rate command response as shown in Fig. 2, resulting in pilots remaining low-gain during the station keeping phase for both low-fidelity conditions.In addition, the UH-60 had a higher force-gradient, which reduced the magnitude of the force compensation relative to the linear model.Overall, the RMS of the force compensation from all pilots was 0.155 lb f for the linear model, and 0.107 lb f for the UH-60.Another interaction effect was found for RMS φ : the RMS of the roll angle was significantly lower for the condition with compensation and the linear model.On the contrary, RMS φ was almost unaffected between the two conditions for the UH-60.This interaction was most likely caused by the same factors as the interaction for RMSE ye and RMS v .It is apparent that the UH-60 model's response and the force gradient of the lateral stick affected pilots' approach to the task.In hindsight, a different approach to the test matrix, e.g., by using the linear model only, but varying the force gradient, might have provided more insight into the relation of pilot control behavior and task performance with motion force feedback.
VII. ConclusionsTo investigate if control force compensation affects pilot control behavior and performance, pilots performed a two degrees-of-freedom lateral side-step task in the VMS under four different motion configurations (high-fidelity, medium-fidelity, low-fidelity, and low-fidelity with compensation) and with two simulated rotorcraft models (linear and UH-60 dynamics).By comparing pilots' control behavior and task performance between conditions, several conclusions could be drawn.The inertial control force compensation introduced significant differences in some of the dependentφ, φ, φ = Roll attitude, rate, and acceleration of simulated rotorcraft φ a y , φ a y , φ a y = Roll attitude, rate, and acceleration of the lateral stick due to inertia effect of lateral acceleration Φ a y = Lateral stick displacement compensation due to lateral acceleration Φ c = Combined lateral stick displacement compensation due to inertial force and torque φ pbd , φ pbd , φ pbd = Roll attitude, rate, and acceleration of the lateral stick due to inertia effect of roll angular acceleration Φ pbd = Lateral stick displacement compensation due to roll angular acceleration ω c f = Cut-off frequency of pilot's lateral stick input ω n = Natural frequency of the lateral stick ζ y = Damping ratio of the lateral stick a y = Lateral acceleration at the lateral stick's pivot point of the simulated rotorcraft in body frame g = Gravitational acceleration constant I xx = Moment of inertia about the pivot point of the lateral stick about the roll rotational axis k y = Force gradient of the lateral stick l c = Length of the lateral stick m c = Mass of the lateral stick p or p b = Roll angular rate of the simulated rotorcraft p b = Roll angular acceleration of the simulated rotorcraft r c = Distance between the pivot point of the stick and the c.g. of the lateral stick RMS = Root mean square SK = Station-keeping score sk = Station-keeping phase of the task t g = Time-to-target in the translation phase of the task trans = Translational phase of the task u = Lateral stick input v = Lateral velocity of the simulated rotorcraft v = Lateral acceleration of the simulated rotorcraft ye = Lateral position error

measures, mainly for the linear model.The control input cutoff frequency was higher, the station keeping score was better, and the RMS of the lateral error was lower with compensation when no motion was present.The RMS of the lateral velocity was marginally significantly lower.Therefore, control force compensation allowed for pilot control behavior and performance more similar to that under high-or medium-fidelity motion to some extent only.Considering all performance variables, we conclude that the control force compensation did not increase overall task performance considering both rotorcraft models at the same time.For the UH-60, the unsteady roll rate command response might have affected pilots' approach to the task and led to a low-gain control technique.In addition, the higher force gradient in the lateral stick for the UH-60 resulted in less inertial force compensation.As a result, the control force compensation only had a minimal effect on pilots' control behavior and task performance for the UH-60 model.This suggests that the control force compensation has limited benefits for controllers that have higher stiffness.Finally, high-fidelity and medium-fidelity motion did not always provide significant improvements in pilot performance compared to the low-fidelity conditions with and without compensation.
			

			
RMS Lateral Velocity, RMS vThe error-bar plot of the RMS lateral velocity for each of the conditions can be seen in Fig. 11b.The summary of the linear mixed effect model is shown in Table 13.RMS v for the UH-60 (M = 1.39) was significantly lower than the RMS v of the linear model (M = 1.65); b = -0.258(SE = 0.075), t(6) = -3.450,p = 0.014.Furthermore, the RMS v was significantly lower for the high-fidelity condition compared to the rest of the conditions; b = -0.084(SE = 0.04), t(25.198)= -2.087,p = 0.047.There was a significant interaction between the model type and the low fidelity conditions; b = 0.205 (SE = 0.082), t(18) = 2.500, p = 0.022.The biggest effect of the force compensation algorithm is observed for the linear model.
RMS Roll Attitude, RMS φThe error-bar plot of the RMS roll attitude for each of the conditions can be seen in Fig. 11c.The summary of the linear mixed effect model is provided in Table 14.There was a significant interaction between the model type in the contrast of the high-fidelity condition against the other conditions; b = 0.219 (SE = 0.0), t(20.53)= 2.738, p = 0.014.Furthermore the model significantly interacted between the low-fidelity condition with (for the linear model M = 5.05 and for the UH-60 M = 6.19)) and without compensation (for the linear model M = 5.98 and for the UH-60 M = 6.185); b = 0.470 (SE = 0.196), t(18) = 2.394, p = 0.028.
VI. DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to investigate if control force compensation affects pilot control behavior and performance.Therefore, the main goal was comparing the low-fidelity condition and without compensation to assess the benefit, if any, of the force feedback algorithm.The high-and medium-fidelity conditions were used as baselines for the low-fidelity conditions.Due to an error in the implementation of the force compensation, the low-fidelity conditions were repeated by the seven pilots in a second experiment session several weeks after the first session.The low-fidelity conditions without compensation (conditions 3 and 7 in Table 1) were identical between the two sessions and were used to verify that pilots performed similarly between the two sessions and assured that session was not a significant confounding variable.Comparing all dependent measures for these conditions between the two sessions revealed that pilots performed the same overall, minimizing the chances of session having a significant effect on the results.
A. HypothesesThe hypotheses provided in Section IV.H were accepted/rejected as follows: H1: The cutoff frequency ω c f was significantly higher in the low-fidelity condition with compensation compared to without compensation for both model types and closer to that in the medium-fidelity condition.However, this trend was not detected in the RMS of the control signal RMS u , which was similar for all low-fidelity conditions.The null hypothesis can not be fully rejected and it must be concluded that control behavior with force compensation is only more similar to that with high-or medium-fidelity motion in some respects.H2: The compensation did not lead to an improvement in all task performance measures.Only RMS ye were significantly lower with compensation.RMS v was marginally significantly lower.We fail to reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the control force compensation did not increase overall task performance considering both rotorcraft models at the same time.H3: Taking into account all the RMS performance parameters in Table 2, there were little differences between the compensation and no compensation data for the UH-60.Results did not reveal a clear benefit of the force compensation with the UH-60 in low-fidelity conditions.No differences were noted in the lateral position error, lateral velocity, and roll attitude.Results showed that the RMS control input for the UH-60 was significantly lower than that of the linear model, indicating the unsteady roll rate response led to pilots staying in low-gain during the station-keeping phase.In addition, the higher force gradient for the UH-60 resulted in less control compensation relative to the linear model.This resulted in many significant interaction effects between the model and the force compensation, suggesting the null hypothesis can be rejected.H4: Only high-fidelity motion had a much higher control input cut-off frequency than all other test conditions.Pilots performing the task under high-fidelity motion also achieved a significantly lower roll attitude and lateral velocity, which suggested pilots were able to use the motion feedback to quickly damp out the roll attitude that commanded the lateral accelerations.The RMS of control input was significantly lower in the medium-fidelity condition than in both low-fidelity conditions.The null hypothesis can not be fully rejected based on these results, i.e., high-fidelity and medium-fidelity motion do not always provide larger improvements in pilot performance compared to both low-fidelity conditions.
