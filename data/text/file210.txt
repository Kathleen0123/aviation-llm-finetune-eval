Terminal-Area Flightpath ManagementCr-u Ls e altitude was 24,000 ft.The fuel-optimum trajectory climbed steeply and more slowly to 32,000 f r , whereupon it began i mmedLa t e l y an ide l e t h r-us t descent.The fuel ConslJmed and the fligbt t i me were 8,750 Jb and 42 min, r-e spect Lve l y •The fuel saving of 750 lb, or 8% of total fuel, is highly significant in airline economics where savings of only 1% are considered important.On the other hand , the increased flight time may be undesirable, but reflects the fact that the cost of time is as eomed to be z c ro in the fuel optimum case.To eliminate the time-fuel trade-off from the comparisons, a cost-optimum trajectory was flown with the time-cost factor C t Selected so as to achieve the same flight time, 37 min.as the standard airline procedure.This trajectory required 9,J50 tb of fuel.Thus, even at fixed arrival time the optimum trajectory reduced fuel consump t i o» 350 l t, , or 3. relative to the airline s ta nda r-d procedure.Clearly. the fuel consumption difference at fixed arrival time provr.desa useful rneaau r c of the efficiency of an airline flight procedure, Fuel savings on longer-range flights were similar in magnitude hut less when expressed as if percentage of total fuel consumed.Pilots judged the optimum t r-aj ecrc r i es fl,lWn wi r.h the aid of a flight director no mor e difficult to fly than the s r nmia r-d p t-ocedu re They consiJ"YcJ the cost-optimization feature an <c'ssential e Lomen r of a future on-buard system.Va r iat Lon s c f this algGrithm have been inn),:poratvd i.n pcr fo r m.snc e rman agcrnen t systems being buill by s cvc r.i t avi on i c roanu iac t.ur-o r., • CAPTURE TRAJECTORY At the present it is not feasible to implement the optimal control solution for this fiVe-statevariable problem, as we were able to do for the one-state-variable en route case.Nevertheless.optimal-control theory played a crucial role in deriving the algorithm.It was first used to derive • the structure and characteristics of extremum trajectories (those that satisfy necess8ry conditions of optimality; see Ref. 4) for two reduced-order subproblems of the original five-state-variable problem.Then some of the derived characteristics were incorporated in the design of the algorithm.Thus, the first step in deriving a practical algorithm is to separate the synthesis into two essentially independent p rob Lems that can be solved in sequence.The first consists of s yn t.hes t z Lng a horizontal p l a ne (two-dimensional) trajector-y that connects the initial p()sition and heading (Xi,Yi,H i) to the final position and heading (Xr'Yf,Hf) ' The second consists of synthesiZing airspeed and altitude profiles that connect initial and final speeds and altitudes and (V F , ,respectively, "long the known ' T h i s techniq~e waS described in Ref.
