Aircraft Trajectory OptimizationThis section presents the optimal trajectory algorithm that minimizes the total cost of travel time and fuel consumption for aircraft on a spherical surface.Optimizing performance of a single aircraft from takeoff to landing in the presence of air traffic constraints and winds is computationally intensive and time consuming.Future air traffic simulation systems will be required to optimize and simulate tens of thousands of aircraft trajectories in seconds or minutes.However, it is impractical and may not be necessary for these systems to generate thousands of optimal and detailed aircraft trajectories.The details of the trajectory optimization required depend on the performance index, the approach and the application.This study adapts a practical optimization approach by assuming a typical structure for an aircraft trajectory and focuses on optimizing direct operating cost during cruise when the time and fuel savings are the most.A typical aircraft trajectory consists of an initial climb, a steady-state cruise, and a final descent.Here, aircraft performance is optimized for the cruise phase only.Typical aircraft profiles are applied for generating trajectories during initial climb and final descent since additional air traffic constraints are involved in these stages and travel time and fuel savings are generally small compared to those during cruise.The cruise trajectory is divided into segments on several altitudes as the optimal cruise altitude increases due to the reduction in aircraft weight as fuel is used.The legal cruising altitudes and the en-route step climb times are optimized based on Eurocontrol's Base of Aircraft Data Revision 3.6 model.The aircraft optimal heading during cruise is the solution of the Zermelo problem derived on a spherical Earth surface in the absence of constraints.The horizontal trajectory segments are optimized based on the costto-go associated with extremals (trajectories) generated by forward or backward integrating the dynamical equations for optimal heading and aircraft motion from various points in the airspace.This computationally efficient algorithm searches for optimal solutions by combining calculus of variations and dynamic programming.The next subsection defines aircraft operating cost and outlines the optimization procedures.The optimization procedures include two stages.The subsection on Optimal Vertical Profile describes solving the optimal aircraft cruise altitudes and enroute step climb times.The subsection on Horizontal Trajectory Generation presents the aircraft model and the procedures for calculating optimal aircraft headings in winds on multiple flight levels.
Aircraft Operating CostThe direct operating cost for a cruising aircraft can be written as: (1) where and are the cost coefficients of time and fuel.The fuel flow rate, f, can be approximated by a function of aircraft mass, m, altitude, h, and airspeed, V. Aggarwal [8] minimizes direct operating costs for long-range transport type aircraft in the absence of winds, and shows that the aircraft Mach number remains almost constant during cruise.This result is adopted here to simplify the search for the optimal solution.For a constant airspeed , the cost function is rewritten as:(2)The optimal can be determined through an iterative process such that the arrival time constraint is met and operating cost is minimized.This operating cost depends on the total travel time and fuel flow rate during cruise.Total travel time is minimized by determining the optimal aircraft heading that yields the minimum-time trajectory in winds and the fuel flow rate is minimized by controlling cruise altitudes given .The computational effort is high, especially for long haul flights, when both winds and aircraft fuel burn are considered in the optimization since en-route meteorological conditions vary with location, and aircraft fuel burn depends on altitude.In order to improve the computational efficiency of the approach, a two stage optimization strategy is proposed for narrowing down the search scope.The first stage optimizes an aircraft vertical profile along the track to determine the optimal cruise altitudes and en-route step climb times given the flight levels constraints.The second stage develops wind-optimal horizontal trajectory segments by determining optimal aircraft heading in winds based on the cruise altitudes and step climb times that are solved in the first stage.
Optimal Vertical ProfileThis subsection develops an aircraft vertical profile based on the fuel consumption model in Eurocontrol's Base of Aircraft Data Revision 3.6 (BADA) [9].First, formulas for calculating the cruise altitude that has the minimum fuel burn rate are derived by assuming a constant cruise speed.Then, they are applied for optimizing the aircraft vertical profile along track based on the aircraft weight and true airspeed.The fuel burn for aircraft during cruise, F, is calculated as:(3)where t is elapsed time.The fuel burn rate, , for jets and turboprops is determined by the specific fuel consumption, , and thrust, Th, and can be expressed in the following form: (4) are the thrust specific fuel consumption coefficients and is the true air speed.During cruise, thrust equals aerodynamic drag force, D, that is a function of aerodynamic drag coefficients, , air density, , aircraft wing reference area, , and true air speed, and is expressed as:(5)The drag coefficient, under normal conditions and except during approach and landing, is specified as a function of the drag coefficient parameters, and the lift coefficient, where:C D = C D 0 + C D 2 C L 2 , C L = 2mg ρSV TAS 2 . (6)Note that the aerodynamic drag is a function of air density that depends on altitude.The formulas for calculating the optimal cruise altitude that has the minimum fuel flow rate are 3D6-4 derived by taking the first order variation of the fuel flow rate with respect to the cruise altitude to zero.Under the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions, the tropopause is at 11,000 meters altitude; and the optimal aircraft cruise altitude, , at or below the tropopause can be calculated by the following formula:h opt = [1-e -f (m,V TAS )K T R gas 2(g +K T R gas )ρ 0_ ISA 2 ]( 1000T 0 _ ISA 6.5). ( 7)Above the tropopause, it is:h opt = -f (m,V TAS ) R gas T trop _ ISA 2gρ trop _ ISA 2 +11000,(8)wheref (m,V TAS ) = ln( 4m 2 g 2 C D 2 S 2 V TAS 4 C D 0 ).is the real gas constant for air.The temperature gradient, , the sea level air density, and the sea level temperature, , are all constant under ISA.The air density, , and temperature, , are also constants at the tropopause.The appendix shows the derivation of these formulas.Optimal cruise altitudes are computed from Eqs. (7,8) based on the atmospheric constants and aerodynamic drag coefficients that are aircraft type dependent.They also vary with aircraft mass and air speed.The thrust margin is also checked to ensure that it is positive when determining the optimal altitudes for each selection of mass and speed.The thrust margin is defined as the maximum cruise thrust minus the thrust required to maintain 100 ft/minute rate of climb at the selected air speed, at the optimal cruise altitude [10].Figure 1 shows the optimal cruise altitudes for various combinations of mass and speed for the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 aircraft.In general, optimal cruise altitudes are lower for higher weights and increase as air speed increases.Note that optimal cruise altitude decreases at very high air speeds when the thrust margins become negative.In these cases, optimal altitudes are recomputed and lowered to meet the thrust margin requirement.
Figure 1. Optimal Cruise Altitudes for MD11During a flight, the optimal cruise altitude increases due to the continuous reduction in aircraft weight as fuel is used.An aircraft weight profile during cruise, for a constant airspeed, is generated using the initial aircraft weight at the start of cruise and the time history of the fuel burn rate.Figure 2 plots the vertical profile for optimal cruise altitudes in blue based on the weight profile in the absence of winds.Due to current air traffic regulation, however, aircraft are not permitted to follow this optimal climb profile, and can instead only cruise on certain flight levels depending on the direction of flights.This study adapts the standard in Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) that eastbound aircraft fly odd thousands of feet while westbound aircraft fly even thousands of feet.The optimal legal cruise altitudes, ,are determined given the set of flyable altitudes, , using the following equation:The vertical profile for an eastbound flight is plotted in magenta in Figure 2.This vertical profile is generated without winds and assumes an instantaneous step climb.It is an approximation for the vertical aircraft profile for determining the enroute legal cruise altitudes and the total travel time at each altitude.
Horizontal Trajectory GenerationThe second stage of the proposed optimization strategy optimizes aircraft horizontal trajectory segments in the presence of winds based on the vertical profile developed in the first stage.Minimizing total aircraft travel time also minimizes total fuel burn for a given vertical profile since the fuel burn rates are specified along the track.The minimum-time trajectory consists of the horizontal trajectory segments on the pre-determined legal cruising altitudes.They are optimized based on the cost-to-go associated with each extremal generated by forward or backward integrating the dynamical equations for optimal heading and aircraft motion from various points in the airspace.This subsection presents the dynamical equation for optimal aircraft heading and the horizontal trajectory optimization algorithm.The aircraft equations of motion at a constant altitude above the spherical Earth's surface are:Ý φ = V cosψ + u(φ,θ,h) Rcosθ , (10) Ý θ = V sinψ + v(φ,θ,h) R , (11) (12)subject to the conditions that thrust equals drag, flight path angle is zero, and the boundary constraints are met. is longitude and is latitude, is heading angle, and is the Earth's radius.The eastcomponent of the wind velocity is , and the north-component of the wind velocity is .It is assumed that the Earth is a sphere and .The previous study [11] applies Pontryagin's Minimum Principle to determine the heading angle that is assumed to be the control available for aircraft during cruise for minimizing the cost of travel time and climate impact.When neglecting the climate impact, the horizontal trajectory is optimized by determining the heading angle that minimizes travel time in the presence of winds.The dynamical equation for the optimal aircraft heading [11] is:Ý ψ = -F wind (ψ,φ,θ,u,v) Rcosθ , (13)where is aircraft heading dynamics in response to winds and is expressed as:F wind (ψ,φ,θ,u,v) = [-sinψ cosψ ∂u(φ,θ,h) ∂φ +cos 2 ψ sinθ u(φ,θ,h) +cos 2 ψ cosθ ∂u(φ,θ,h) ∂θ - ∂v(φ,θ,h) ∂φ +sinψ cosψ sinθ v(φ,θ,h) +cosψ sinψ cosθ ∂v(φ,θ,h) ∂θ +V cosψ sinθ + cos 2 ψ ∂v(φ,θ,h) ∂φ ].(14)A recent study [7] developed the same dynamical equation for computing minimum-time path.These studies [7,11] reduced the trajectory optimization problem from a two-point boundary value problem to an initial value problem.Numerical algorithms such as collocation methods, used in [11], or interpolation techniques, as used in [7], can be applied to determine the optimal initial aircraft heading.In the case that an aircraft cruises at a single altitude, the minimum-time trajectory is completely specified by integrating Eqs.(1, 2, 14) simultaneously from the origin to the destination using the optimal initial aircraft heading.In general, an aircraft cruises at multiple altitudes to accommodate weight reduction, thereby 3D6-6 minimizing fuel burn, as described in the previous subsection.The minimum-time trajectory is the combination of wind-optimal extremals on several different altitudes, each solved using wind conditions on that altitude.This study employs the concept of dynamic programming for constructing the minimum-time trajectory with wind-optimal extremals at different cruise altitudes.The optimal vertical profile provides the initial and subsequent optimal cruise altitudes as well as the transition times between the altitudes.The following five steps compute the horizontal minimum-time trajectory.
Using a range of different initial headingangles at the start of the initial cruise segment, a collection of wind-optimal extremals is generated by forward integrating Eqs.(10, 11, and 14) until the first step climb time.This step is illustrated by plotting the wind-optimal extremals in blue in Figure 3 for a flight from Anchorage to Hong Kong.The complete wind-optimal trajectory for a flight from Anchorage, AK to Hong Kong on August 1, 2010 is shown in Figure 5.The wind vectors at flight levels 360, 380 and 400 are plotted in blue, magenta and cyan, respectively.A flight level is a standard altitude of an aircraft in hundreds of feet.Each trajectory segment is optimized with respect to the winds at the associated flight level.
Figure 5. Wind-Optimal TrajectoryThe wind magnitudes and directions are taken from the Global Forecast System (GFS).GFS is a global numerical weather prediction computer model run by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) four times a day.It produces forecasts up to 16 days, and produces a forecast for every 3rd hour for the first 180 hours, and after that, every 12 hours.The horizontal resolution is roughly equivalent to 0.5×0.5 degree latitude/longitude.GFS data has 64 unequally-spaced vertical isobaric pressure levels ranging between 0.25-1000 mb, with enhanced resolution at low and high altitude.
Experimental SetupsThe trajectory optimization algorithm is applied to assess the potential benefits of flying wind-optimal trajectories with an optimal vertical profile for commercial cargo flights operating at Anchorage, AK.The trajectory computations use air traffic and global wind data from October 2010, obtained from the GFS.Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) is a major hub airport for cargo flights between the U.S. and Asia, being less than 9.5 hours from 90% of the industrialized world [12].For this paper we analyze nearly 12,500 Federal Express (FedEx) and United Parcel Service (UPS) cargo flights from 2010.Based on these data, Figure 6 shows the 10 most popular origin airports for flights to ANC.Almost 80% of inbound FedEx and UPS flights depart from these 10 origin airports.Over 90% of outbound FedEx and UPS flights from ANC fly to the 10 destination airports shown in Figure 7. Table 1 lists the airport names and codes for the top origins and destinations.About 99% of the aircraft in the data set belong to the five aircraft types shown in  Aircraft trajectories are optimized based on the aerodynamic parameters and aircraft performance data provided by BADA for the five aircraft types described above.BADA does not include the B77L, so the aerodynamic parameters and aircraft performance data for the Boeing 777-200 (B772) are used instead.High takeoff mass is assumed for each aircraft type since commercial cargo flights are usually heavily loaded.Typical aircraft climb and descent profiles during initial climb, en-route step climbs and final descent are obtained for each aircraft type from BADA performance files for generating the complete aircraft trajectories.These are defined based on altitude, air speed and mass for each phase.This study does not optimize cruise speed for each flight.The optimal speed depends on the cost performance index that is generally specified by the airlines and chosen according to their priorities.In addition, current BADA parameters, such as the drag coefficients, may only be valid at the specified nominal speeds.The current optimization procedure solves for the optimal speed by iterating a range of cruise speeds that requires a more detailed aerodynamic model.In this paper, the true air speed during cruise is calculated from the typical Mach number suggested by BADA.
ResultsThis section presents the potential benefits for commercial cargo flights of flying wind-optimal trajectories with an optimal vertical profile.Past studies focus on developing minimum-time trajectories in winds at a single altitude without considering potential fuel savings from en-route step climbs.The subsection on Comparing Wind Optimal Trajectories, below, compares wind optimal trajectories with an optimal vertical profile (WO) to wind optimal trajectories at a single flight level (WO1FL).The trajectories are compared for cargo flights between ANC and the top 10 origin and destination airports for flights to and from ANC.The subsection on Comparing Flight Plan and Wind Optimal Trajectories assesses the performance of the wind optimal trajectories with an optimal vertical profile (WO) and the flight plan trajectories (FP) along the same vertical profile.
Comparing Wind Optimal TrajectoriesThis subsection analyzes the WO and WO1FL trajectories for cargo flights to and from ANC.The performance of the WO trajectories is evaluated by assessing and comparing average fuel consumption and travel time of these trajectories to that of the WO1FL trajectories.Figure 9 shows the average fuel savings in bar graphs for each origin, destination and aircraft type, for all cargo flights in 2010 to and from ANC. Flying the WO trajectories has a positive fuel saving for all of the origins and destinations except KOAK and KIND.Fuel savings are between 0.1% and 3% depending on the airport pairs.They are directly proportional to the length of the routes, which determines the number of en-route step climbs.The average travel time, fuel burn, and number of step climbs for the top 10 origins are shown in Table 2.The average time and fuel savings are shown in parentheses.The potential fuel savings are very small for all domestic flights since most of them have only one step climb.Flights between ANC and KOAK or KIND have the shortest travel time.For these routes, performing an en-route step climb actually increases the total fuel burn.Note that the additional fuel burn required for each step climb is not considered when developing the aircraft vertical profile, which assumes instantaneous climb for simplicity in the optimization.Most international flights save more than 1% fuel depending on the aircraft types.The B744 and B772 have the largest amount of fuel savings while the MD11 and B763 have similar amount of fuel savings.The WO trajectories for all the domestic flights have equal or longer travel times than the corresponding WO1FL trajectories.The additional time involved in climbing and descending is not negligible for these relatively short trips.The WO trajectories for all international flights except RJAA, which is the shortest of the international routes, have positive time savings.The time savings not only depend on the trip length but also on the flight direction.The travel time for each flight is affected by en-route wind magnitude and direction.Therefore, long-distance WO trajectories not only gain fuel savings from en-route step climbs but may also benefit from high-speed winds at higher altitudes.
Flight Plan and Wind Optimal TrajectoriesIn the future, with improvements in air traffic management, route structures are likely to become more flexible.With these more flexible route structures, future air traffic will be able to choose to fly their preferred routes to a greater extent than is the case today.This subsection assesses the potential benefits for the FedEx and UPS cargo flights when they fly WO trajectories instead of FP routes.Both the WO and FP trajectories follow the optimal vertical profiles.Table 3 presents the average savings per flight, in descending order, for the top origins and destinations to and from ANC.The potential savings for the inbound flights to ANC are shown in the blue 3D6-11 cells and the data for the outbound flights from ANC are in the green cells.Figure 10 shows the average percentage savings for fuel in solid bar graphs for each origin, destination and aircraft type.The average fuel savings are highly correlated to the time savings for each origin, destination and aircraft type.The savings for each flight are proportional to the total travel time difference between the WO and FP trajectories since both follow the same vertical profile.The magnitudes of time savings are affected by en-route wind conditions and the structure of the original flight plans.Flying the WO trajectories has a positive saving in fuel and time for all the origins and destinations when compared to the FP trajectories.The domestic flights have up to 3% savings that are equivalent to about 5-10 minutes in time and 0.4-1.0tonnes of fuel for the top three domestic airports: KSDF, KEWR and KMEM.The international flights can potentially save more than 10% by flying wind optimal trajectories.For the outbound flights to VHHH, RKSI and ZSPD, travel time is reduced by 23-54 minutes and fuel burn by 2.3-7.6 tonnes.In general, the savings are proportional to the trip lengths.They also depend on the direction of flight and aircraft types.Long-distance international flights gain large time and fuel savings for all aircraft types.Domestic flights with MD11, B744, or B772 have larger fuel savings than with B763 and DC10.The domestic flights from ANC to KOAK and the international flights from RJAA to ANC have the smallest savings, respectively.Note that the accuracy of the assessed benefits is greatly affected by the quality of the flight plans in the database.FP trajectories that are simulated using flight plans with an incomplete list of waypoints lead to an underestimation of the required travel time and fuel burn.This is because flights are assumed to fly great circle routes between waypoints.If a flight plan has few waypoints, the FP trajectory is similar to the great circle trajectory for that flight.Subject to the wind conditions, great circle trajectories can be very similar to wind-optimal trajectories, especially for the short trips.Hence, the benefit of flying a wind optimal trajectory is underestimated for these flights.Several other factors also affect the accuracy of the results.The actual vertical flight path of each FP trajectory is approximated by those of WO trajectory since the actual aircraft takeoff weight and airspeed profile for each flight are not available in the current database.Each simulated FP trajectory follows the vertical path that assumes a typical aircraft weight and an airspeed profile from BADA instead of the original vertical profile.This approximation may results in the performance underestimation for FP trajectories.In addition, the potential benefits for WO trajectories need to be discounted since they neglect the additional costs involved in operating inside foreign airspace.Figure 2 .2Figure 2.

When the last cruise altitude is reached, the minimum-time trajectory at the last altitude is calculated by forward integrating Eqs.(10, 11, and 14) using the correct heading angle at the start of the last cruise altitude.The heading angle is calculated by interpolating the aircraft headings from the backward extremals at the final cruise altitude.

ConclusionsThis study developed a trajectory optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost of time and fuel burn by integrating a method for computing minimum-time routes in winds on multiple horizontal planes and an aircraft fuel burn model for generating fuel-optimal vertical profiles.It is applied to evaluate the potential benefits of flying wind-optimal routes in a seamless airspace for commercial cargo flights operating between Anchorage, Alaska and major airports in Asia and the contiguous United States.Flying wind optimal trajectories with fuel-optimal vertical profiles reduces average fuel burn of international flights flying at a single cruise altitude by 1-3%.Long-distance flights not only gain fuel savings from en-route step climbs but may also benefit from high-speed winds at higher altitudes.The potential fuel savings of performing en-route step climbs are very small for the domestic cargo flights since most of them have only one step climb.The optimal trajectories reduce fuel burn and travel time relative to their flight plan routes for all the airport pairs.Domestic flights can potentially save up to 3% on fuel burn and travel time, which is equivalent to about 5-10 minutes in time and 0.4-1.0tonnes of fuel for the top three domestic airports.International flights can potentially save up to 10% on fuel and travel time by flying wind optimal trajectories, reducing travel time by 23-54 minutes and fuel burn by 2.3-7.6 tonnes.In general, the savings are proportional to the trip lengths, and depend on the en-route wind conditions and aircraft types.
