(2012) developed optimal flight trajectories that minimized flight time and fuel burn by computing minimum-time routes in winds on multiple flight levels.Palopo et al. (2010) conducted a simulation of WORs and the impact on sector loading, conflicts, and airport arrival rates using a method developed by Jardin and Bryson (2001).Jardin and Bryson (2012) continued their research in this area by computing minimum-time flight trajectories using analytical neighboring WOR in the presence of a strong jet stream with winds of up to 80 m s -1 .Prior research shows pilots seek to avoid areas of turbulence, and the impact of those maneuvers to ATM has been documented.Krozel et al. (2011) studied the maneuvers pilots made when they encountered Clear-Air Turbulence (CAT).They showed the pilot's response to CAT depended on factors such as aircraft type and company policies.In that study, they looked at turbulence maneuvers for the next 50 miles of flight and found that descending to a smooth flight level to be the usual tactical solution.Ignoring CAT near a jet stream of strong winds to achieve minimum-time routes may result in flight and fuel savings that cannot be fully realized due to a pilot's unwillingness to traverse turbulent areas to reach the maximum tail winds.Research shows two-thirds of all severe CAT occurs near the jet stream (Lester 1994).Turbulence information can also aid in the development of routes around convective systems.Ng et al. (2009) calculated convective weather avoidance routes considering the probability of pilot deviation using a model based on radar data.The model used by them and others to predict pilot behavior around convective systems, the Convective Weather Avoidance Model (CWAM), uses ground-based radar information to determine areas of convection where pilots will likely avoid (Delaura and Evans 2006).CWAM is currently used by NASA's Dynamic Weather Routing tool to create in-flight routing around convective weather and has been evaluated in field studies in collaboration with American Airlines (McNally et al. 2012).However, such a model can miss regions of Convectively Induced Turbulence (CIT) outside the convective clouds.To address the lack of turbulence information in WOR applications, a predictive model of aviation-scale turbulence, such as the Graphical Turbulence Guidance (GTG) product (Sharman et al. 2006;Kim et al. 2011) in which an ensemble of turbulence diagnostics are computed can be used to modify the WOR solution.The turbulence diagnostics in turn are based on forecasts from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model or ensemble of NWP models.Steiner et al. (2013) reviewed ensemble-based forecasting techniques and state that ensemble forecasting can be applied to turbulence.They also point out that probabilistic forecasts are appropriate for ATM strategic planning as they may provide guidance about the uncertainty associated with weatherrelated phenomena.Here, time-lagged ensemble NWP forecasts are used to drive ensembles of turbulence diagnostics to provide probabilistic information about turbulence likelihood.And in order to better predict the effects of convection as well as provide better representation of mountain wave and clear-air turbulence sources, a high-resolution (3 km horizontal grid spacing) NWP model is implemented.Further, each computed turbulence diagnostic is scaled to energy dissipation rate (EDR = ε 1/3 m 2/3 s -1 ) as an aircraft-independent atmospheric turbulence metric.EDR is defined as the rate of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) transfer from large-scale to small-scale eddies.The large-scale eddies in atmosphere are inherently unstable.These large eddies break up and cascade down to smaller-scale eddies until the viscous dissipation becomes dominant and the TKE is converted to heat.The model-derived EDR metric is consistent with in situ EDR estimates currently available from several fleets of commercial airliners including B767s, B757s and B737s (Cornman et al. 1995;Sharman et al. 2014), which is convenient for forecast verification.The in situ EDR metric can be related to traditional turbulence intensity based on pilot-reported categories of "light (LGT)", "moderate (MOD)", and "severe (SEV)" by appropriate considerations of aircraft type and flight conditions (Sharman et al. 2014).For reasons discussed in Sharman et al. (2014), EDR is the preferred atmospheric turbulence unit for aviation-scale observations and forecasts.The following sections describe the methodology and procedures for creating new turbulence forecasts.A comparison of these new forecasts with observed radar reflectivity and automated in situ EDR data is presented to assess the reliability and accuracy of the forecasts.Finally, as an example of turbulence application to ATM, WORs are computed from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) with and without a turbulence forecast.
Methodology and procedures of the turbulence forecastsFrom a meteorological perspective, small-scale turbulent eddies that directly affect commercial aircraft at cruising altitudes are generated by a number of possible sources.For example, strong vertical shears above and below a jet stream core, inertial instability due to anticyclonic shear and curvature flow, and the gravity wave emissions via geostrophic adjustment in the jet stream exit region are well-known turbulence generation mechanisms near an upper-level jet/frontal system (e.g., Lane et al. 2004;Kim andChun 2010, 2011;Knox et al. 2008).Mountain wave breaking frequently causes aviation turbulence over complex topographic regions (e.g., Lane et al. 2009;Sharman et al. 2011Sharman et al. , 2012)).Flow deformation, gravity wave breaking, and thermalshear instability near the various convective systems are also important sources for aviation turbulence (e.g., Lane et al. 2003;Lane andSharman 2008, 2014;Kim and Chun 2012;Kim et al. 2014;Trier and Sharman 2009;Trier et al. 2010).To take into account these many turbulence generation mechanisms as well as uncertainties in the NWP model forecasts, a combination of several turbulence metrics due to different mechanisms and from different forecasts is essential, and is more reliable than using a single diagnostic or simple rule-of-thumb predictor (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006;Kim et al. 2011;Gill 2014;Gill and Stirling 2013).In addition, a convection-permitting highresolution numerical weather prediction model is more useful to capture small-scale turbulent eddies induced by convective activity or other turbulence sources.This new turbulence forecast method is a sequence of four different processes, which is summarized below.1) A high-resolution NWP forecast model is used to produce 3D meteorological data such as u, v, and w wind components, potential temperature (θ), pressure (p), humidity, and cloud mixing ratios at a given valid time.Time-lagged ensembles are constructed from the forecast fields for different lead-times but valid at the same time.2) Ten aviation turbulence metrics, each based on combinations of horizontal and/or vertical gradients of 3D meteorological variables from the NWP model, are calculated.3) The ten metrics from the different time-lagged forecasts are mapped into a common atmospheric turbulence-scale (EDR-scale) based on the assumed log-normal (random) distributions.4) All EDR-scale metrics are combined to produce both deterministic and probabilistic turbulence forecasts using different weights as a function of turbulence forecasting skill of each metric and is used to modify the WORs.
a. Weather modelIn the first step, the WRF-ARW model version 3.5, is used as the weather forecast model in this study.This model uses a finite-difference method for non-hydrostatic and fully compressible prognostic equations on an Arakawa-C grid and terrain-following vertical sigma levels (Skamarock and Klemp 2007).The WRF-ARW model has been successfully applied to understand possible generation mechanisms of severe turbulence cases under different environmental weather conditions (e.g., Trier and Sharman 2009;Trier et al. 2010;Kim and Chun 2010;2012;Kim et al. 2014).Design of the WRF-ARW model is the same as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) high-resolution rapid refresh HRRR (http://ruc.noaa.gov/hrrr/)operational system.The horizontal domain covers the entire CONUS (Figs. 1 and2).The horizontal grid spacing is 3 km, and model top is at 20 hPa with 50 vertical layers, which leads to be about 500 m vertical grid spacing in the Upper-Troposphere and Lower-Stratosphere (UTLS).Rayleigh damping for the w-wind component is applied in a sponge layer of uppermost 5-km from the model top.Subgrid-scale microphysical processes are parameterized using the Thompson et al. (2004) scheme.Longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations use the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM; Mlawer et al. 1997).Land Surface Model (LSM) providing upward fluxes at surface for the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) scheme is parameterized by Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) LSM (Smirnova et al. 2000).Subgrid-scale vertical mixing is parameterized by the Mellor-Yamada-Janjić (MYJ) scheme (Janjić 2002) not only in the PBL but also in free atmosphere by solving the 1.5 order Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) equation (Mellor and Yamada 1982).The longest forecast time of each model run is six hours, and the frequency of model output is 15 minutes, which is also the same as the HRRR.Initial and boundary conditions use hourly reanalyses data over the CONUS from the 13-km Rapid Refresh (RAP) model domain.The spin-up time of the model is about 30 minutes, which is somewhat faster than other regional models, likely because the hydrometeors are already enhanced in the initial condition of the RAP 13-km domain by assimilating the ground-based radar observation (http://ruc.noaa.gov/hrrr/).The model was run using the Pleiades supercomputer at the NASA Ames Research Center (http://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/).The wall-clock run-time using 500 cores took an hour to complete one model run with 15-minute forecast outputs up to six hours.The runtime could be decreased by using more computer resources, but the one-hr run time should be adequate for most operational purposes.The following are example comparisons of the WRF-ARW model forecasts against the observed meteorology for two selected cases.The first case is for the 36 hour period from 0600 UTC 7 to 1800 UTC 8 September 2012 when several turbulence encounters were observed near convective systems over the CONUS (Figs. 1a andb).At 1730 UTC 7 September, several convective clouds begin to develop along a surface cold front elongated from the Great Lakes to Kansas.Locally isolated convective clouds also developed ahead of the cold front along a squall line over Illinois and Indiana (Fig. 1a).Several turbulence events with EDRs ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 scattered in the Northeastern CONUS, reported by the in situ measurements from commercial aircraft, were probably due to the convection well to the west (Fig. 1).An EDR of 0.22 corresponds to moderate turbulence for large commercial aircraft by Sharman et al. (2014).Note this value is lower than the current ICAO standard value form "moderate" of 0.40 m 2/3 s -1 .Some of these EDR reports are located within convective cloud, while others are outside of visible deep convection as confirmed by the radar data in Figs.1a andb.As the upper-level trough deepened, clusters of thunderstorms along the eastward-moving cold front shown in Fig. 1b swept out the entire eastern and southern CONUS regions on 7-8 September 2012.These radar observations are reasonably well captured by the WRF-ARW model.In particular, forecasted echo tops along an elongated front from the Great Lakes to Kansas in Figs.1c andd are qualitatively similar to the observed radar data in Figs.1a andb.This gives confidence that the large-scale flow-generated convective clouds responsible for aircraft-scale turbulence are well reproduced by the ARW-WRF model in this study.Considering that the upper-level westerly jet stream is dominant during this period over the northeastern CONUS (see Figs. 8 and 9 later), turbulence scattered in this area during this period is likely to be generated by interactions between a deep convectioninduced disturbance and jet stream-related instabilities.The second example case is the 12 hours period (0600-1800 UTC) on 31 December 2011 when strong mountain wave activity is dominant due to the passage of a strong northwesterly jet stream over the Rocky mountain region.As shown in Fig. 2a, there are no well-developed convective systems over the CONUS, which is also reliably simulated by the ARW-WRF model (Fig. 2b).Some clouds with echo tops lower than 20,000 ft (hereafter FL200) appear over Nebraska, but those are far away from the observed turbulence encounters over the mountain regions in both Colorado and Utah (Fig. 2b).Strong northwesterly jet flow embbeded on a planetary short wave is passing over the complex mountain ranges of the western US (Fig. 2c).This in turn generates mountain waves that propagate vertically up to the tropopause, as evidenced by the complicated wave patterns of vertical velocity over the western mountains (Fig. 2d).During this period, turbulence encounters ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 observed by in situ EDR occur not near the convective system but over the Rocky mountain regions, which is mainly due to the interactions between the mountain waves and the background wind (Figs.2c andd).Some of elevated in situ reports are far downstream of the mountains near the border between Colorado and Nebraska, which may be related to the downstream propagation of the lee wave and/or jet-stream related gravity waves that trigger instabilities.Due to the multiple turbulence-causing mechanisms in these and other cases, combinations of turbulence metrics based on various turbulence generation mechanisms are essential to accurately forecast turbulence events.In all, a total of 270 turbulence encounters ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 EDR value were observed over the CONUS by the in situ EDR measurements during two selected periods, and these are available for verification of the turbulence forecasts.
b. Turbulence diagnosticsFor the second step, ten different turbulence diagnostics are computed.Although the horizontal grid spacing of 3 km was used in the WRF-ARW model, the horizontal size of aircraft-scale turbulence (normally 10-1,000 m) is still much smaller (i.e., subgrid-scale).However, aircraft-scale turbulence can be diagnosed by assuming that small-scale turbulent eddies directly affecting commercial aircraft cascade down from large-scale (resolved scale) disturbances and are revealed as high values of the turbulence diagnostics (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006;Kim et al. 2011;Williams and Josh 2013).In this study, three different time-lagged ensemble members of weather forecasts (e.g., 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5-hr) were used to calculate the turbulence diagnostics for each valid time.The upper-level turbulence diagnostics selected have relatively high performance skill in previous and current operational upper-level GTG systems (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006).The ten turbulence metrics used are the WRF-produced subgridscale turbulent kinetic energy (SGS TKE), Frehlich and Sharman's (2004)
c. EDR mapping techniqueThis third step maps each turbulence diagnostic to a common atmospheric turbulence scale.The previously described turbulence diagnostics have different numerical formulations and units.However, a final turbulence forecast should be on a common scale such as the EDR.EDR is independent of aircraft type or size and mapping turbulence diagnostics into the EDR scale allows them to be compared with observed in situ EDR measurements.So, all of the turbulence diagnostics calculated were mapped to the EDR metric.In this study, we assumed that each model-derived turbulence diagnostic has a log-normal distribution that can be derived from the best fit function of the log-scale Probability Density Function (PDF) especially for larger values of turbulence diagnostics for longer period of time (Sharman et al. 2014).Figures 3 and4 show an example of nine EDR-scale metrics from a 2.5-hr forecast product averaged over three different flight levels of FL300, FL350, and FL400 valid at 1730 UTC 7 September 2012 and at 1830 UTC December 2011, respectively.In general, most of the EDR-scale metrics for relatively larger values (orange shading; EDR ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 ) are consistent with the turbulence encounters ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 values in the observed in situ EDR measurements in commercial flights both near the convective system for the first case (Fig. 3) and over the Rocky mountain regions for the second case (Fig. 4).And, relatively lower values of EDR-scale metrics also capture well the smooth areas of the in-flight bumpiness < 0.01 m 2/3 s -1 values depicted as graydotted lines over the CONUS.But, there are some places where some EDR-scale metrics over estimate some smooth regions of in situ EDR reports of bumpy areas, which increases the false alarm ratio (FAR), and therefore should be considered as a score function in the ensemble of metrics.
d. Ensemble of EDR-scale turbulence metricsThe final step combines all EDR-scale metrics into deterministic and probabilistic turbulence forecasts.At a given forecast time, we used a total 30 of EDR-scale metrics [i.e., ten different turbulence metrics from three different NWP forecasts (e.g., 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 hr forecast data)] for the ensemble EDR forecasts.For the deterministic ensemble EDR, 30 EDR-scale metrics are combined into a weighted ensemble mean (e.g., Figs.5a andc) using different weighting functions of each metric (W i ), as follows.𝐸𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝐸𝐷𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) = ∑ 𝑊 𝑖 𝐸𝐷𝑅 𝑖 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) 𝑁 𝑖=1 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, … , 𝑁 = 30. (1) 𝑊 𝑖 = (𝐴𝑈𝐶 𝑖 /𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ (𝐴𝑈𝐶 𝑖 /𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑖 ) 2 𝑁 𝑖=1 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, … , 𝑁 = 30.(2)Here, the weighting function in Eq. ( 2) is as a combination of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Probability Of Detection "yes" for the EDR value ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 and "no" for the EDR value smaller than 0.01 m 2/3 s -1 (PODY and PODN) statistics for each EDR-scale turbulence metric.Details of the AUC metric will be presented in the next section.An attribute of a probabilistic forecast product is that it takes into account the uncertainties in the underlying NWP forecast model.In this study, at the given valid time a 3D probabilistic ensemble for Severe-Or-Greater (SOG)-level turbulence areas are calculated by counting how many EDR-scale individual turbulence metrics out of the total 30 metrics have EDR values ≥ 0.47 m 2/3 s -1 at each grid point in the model, which is depicted in Figs.5b andd.Here, the threshold is adapted from the median value of in situ EDR-severe PIREP pairs for longer period over the CONUS (Sharman et al. 2014).Figure 5 shows a snapshot of (a and c) a deterministic ensemble EDR using Eq. ( 1)and (b and d) a probabilistic forecast for SOG-level turbulence for the two cases.These are averaged over flight levels FL300, FL350, and FL400 using three time-lagged ensemble members of forecast data (1.5-3.5 hr) valid on 1730 UTC September 2012(upper) and on 1830 UTC December 2011 (lower).The results show the deterministic ensemble EDR for larger values (orange shading; EDR ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 ) mostly agrees well with the observed in situ EDR measurements ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 (blue asterisks) in Fig.5 (left).For the probabilistic forecast (Fig. 5 right), the 10% SOG-level turbulence probability is also well correlated with the observations (blue asterisks) especially over western Michigan and northern Ohio on 7 September 2012 (Fig. 5b) and over the western mountains in Utah and Colorado on 31 December 2011 (Fig. 5d).Considering that the background (natural) probability for SOG-level turbulence encounters in UTLS is less than 0.1% (Sharman et al. 2006;2014), the forecasted 10% SOG-level turbulence probability (orange color shading) in Fig. 5 (right) is regarded as significantly higher than the background SOG-level turbulence potential in UTLS.The choice of the 10% SOG probability threshold is arbitrary, but has similar features to the 50% MOG probability in this study.But, the reason we emphasize the 10% SOG turbulence probability in this figure is because in the aviation community avoiding SOG turbulence is regarded as a hard constraint that should be always avoided, while any MOG threshold is a soft constraint that aircraft may penetrate by employing the fasten seatbelt sign.
Evaluation of deterministic EDR metricsIn this section, the forecasted EDR-scaled turbulence diagnostics shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and the deterministic ensemble EDR shown in Fig. 5 (left) are compared with in situ EDR reports to objectively obtain their statistical skill.The forecasting performance skills are calculated using the probability-of-detection "yes" for the EDR ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 (PODY) versus "no" for the EDR < 0.01 m 2/3 s -1 (PODN).This technique has been usedfor the verification of various turbulence forecasts (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006 (3)and if the forecasted EDR value near the null observation is smaller (higher) than the observed in situ EDR, the N for N obs (Y for N obs ) was counted.These procedures were applied to a total of 270 turbulence events ≥ 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 EDR value [hereafter moderate-or-greater (MOG) EDR] and 55,150 smooth events with EDR < 0.01 m 2/3 s -1 on both 7-8 September 2012 and 31 December 2011.This process was repeated through 20 different thresholds that ranged from EDR values of 0 to 1, resulting in 20 PODY and PODN statistics for both the ensemble EDR and EDR-scale turbulence metrics.December 2011, and (c) both cases, for various forecast lead times (1.5-5.5 hr).Values of area under these curves (AUC) are a measure of the forecast performance skill (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006;Kim et al. 2011).An AUC = 1 is a perfect forecast [i.e., a turbulence metric can perfectly discriminate all MOG EDR and smooth events and/or a turbulence metric has a perfect forecast for MOG EDR without any false alarm ratios (3) using three different forecast lead times (1; using 1.5-3.5 hrs data, 2; using 2.5-4.5 hrs data, and 3; using 3.5-5.5 hrs data).In Fig. 6, the ensemble EDRs have generally higher forecasting performance skill than any of single EDR-scale turbulence metric.Especially for the first case on 7-8September 2012 (Figs.6a andb), the ensemble EDRs have AUC values around 0.83-0.84,which is superior to the AUC values of single EDR-scale metrics of between 0.69-0.81.This result is the same as in the second case on 31 December 2011 (Figs.6c andd).This is consistent with the previous results of turbulence forecasts that the integrated turbulence metrics provide superior forecasting skill than any single turbulence metric at least in terms of the AUC performance metric (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006;Kim et al. 2011;Gill 2014;Gill and Stirling 2013).To assess the stability of these results we randomly picked half fractions of the 270 turbulence and 55,150 smooth events and reevaluated them 100 times.The minimum and maximum AUC values of the final deterministic EDR forecast are 0.77 and 0.9, respectively, which is about a -9% to +6% difference around the obtained performance (0.85) in Fig. 6e andf.Although this does not imply that the performance would be better or not in other cases, the variability of the obtained skill is statistically stable at least in these cases, and this performance is consistent with the previous studies (e.g., Sharman et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2011).Overall, the forecast skill for the second case is generally higher than those in the first case.This is somewhat expected since the nature of the turbulence events for the first case are associated with convective systems (Fig. 1) which are not as reliably forecasted as those in the second case near the mountain areas (Fig. 2).This implies that the fidelity of the cloud-resolving scale WRF model is higher in the case of mountain wave-induced turbulence than in the convectively driven turbulence case.All of the AUC and RMSE values as well as an example of the weighting scores derived from the Eq. ( 2) for the ten turbulence metrics are shown in Table 2.In general, as we expected, the RMSE values increase in all EDR-scale metrics, as the forecast-lead time increases from 1.5-hr to 5.5-hr according to the decreasing fidelity of the weather forecast.The combination of the AUC and RMSE values according to the Eq. ( 1) gives the weighting scores such that the FS EDR/Ri metric has the largest contribution for the ensemble EDR with the highest AUC and lowest RMSE values, while the F2D/Ri metric is the smallest contribution.The SGS TKE metric also has a small contribution because it is from the Planetary Boundary Layer scheme in the WRF-ARW model, which cannot be expected to perform well in stably-stratified shear-flow turbulence characteristic of the UTLS.
Example of turbulence application to ATMIn this section, an example WOR based on lateral deviations only using turbulence information for ATM planning is described.With a correct choice of initial heading angle, the minimum-time path in the presence of wind (i.e., WOR) can be obtained by applying Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (Bryson and Ho 1975) to determine the analytic solution for the control parameter (here, the heading angle of cruising aircraft; Here, ϕ, θ, and ψ are longitude, latitude, and heading angle of the aircraft, and U and V are wind components, respectively.R is the Earth's radius that Earth is assumed to be a sphere and R >> z, and V a is the airspeed of aircraft, assumed to be 250 m s -1 .The analytic solution for the control parameter (ψ) that minimizes the total travel time from the departure to arrival is𝑑 ( ) 𝑑 = - 𝐹 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 ( ) 𝑅 𝑠 ( ) .(6)A full derivation of the analytic solution including F wind (t) in Eq. ( 6) is described in Appendix B.A shooting method is used to find the initial heading angle.First, the great circle heading angle (ψ GC ) between the departure and arrival points is used as the first guess of the initial heading angle [ψ(t 0 )].And then, we solved the Eqs.( 4), ( 5), and (6) using an explicit Euler forward integration scheme,[𝛼( + 1) = 𝛼( ) + ∆ 𝑑𝛼(𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 , 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝛼 = , , 𝑎𝑛𝑑 . ], from LAX [ϕ(t 0 ), θ(t 0 ), ψ(t 0 )] to JFK [ϕ(t f ), θ(t f ), ψ(t f )] with Δt = 60seconds (1 min).This process is iterated with different initial heading angles [ψ(t 0 )] within two boundary values (ψ GC -22.5° and ψ GC + 22.5°) until the distance between a waypoint of the WOR trajectory and JFK is minimized.Figure 7 shows example WORs without consideration of turbulence effects from LAX to JFK along with plots for horizontal winds and probabilistic ensemble EDR for SOG at FL350 and their cross-sections valid at 1730 UTC 7 September 2012 and 1830 UTC 31 December 2011.In the first case (Fig. 7a), a flight cruising at FL350 along the WOR would take 238 minutes (3 hr 58 min), which is 2 minutes less than the elapsed time along the great circle route with wind (sky-blue line).In Fig. 7a, the WOR would experience a total of 52 minutes of areas ≥ 10% probability of encountering SOG-level turbulence over northern Indiana, Ohio, and western Pennsylvania.In the vertical cross-section along this WOR (Fig. 7c), the 10% SOG-level turbulence areas seem to block all possible flight levels from FL260 to FL450 over these regions.This indicates that Lateral Avoidance Turbulence Routes (LTARs) would be better suited to avoid turbulence than vertical changes of the flight level in this case.In Fig. 7b, the second case shows the same situation as in Fig. 7a with the WOR, taking 238 minutes and experiencing 20 minutes in the SOG-level turbulence areas from LAX to JFK, which is 2 minutes less elapsed time than the great circle route with wind (sky-blue line).And, in Fig. 7d, the turbulence potential areas are vertical from FL230 to FL450 near southern Colorado, which again implies that the LTARs would be a better choice than vertical avoidance.Fortunately, in the second case (Fig. 7b), only a small lateral deviation from the WOR (blue line) can entirely avoid the turbulence region.To demonstrate quantitatively the effects of turbulence avoidance on the WOR routes, we use a probabilistic ensemble EDR ≥ 10% probability of encountering SOGlevel turbulence (i.e., LTAR).The SOG-level is selected because it is considered a hard constraint that pilots should avoid due to aviation safety concerns.And, a 10%probability is chosen because it correlates well with observed in situ EDR reports greater than 0.22 m 2/3 s -1 already shown in Figs.5b andd.The LTAR can be determined by following the same approach for the optimization of the WOR with a different minimization condition or cost function (J), as follows.𝐽 = ∫ {𝐶 𝑡 + 𝐶 𝑟 𝑟( , , 𝑧)}𝑑 𝑡 𝑓 𝑡 0 . (7)Here, C t and C r are the cost coefficients of travel time and penalty areas along the LTAR, respectively.In this study, r(ϕ, θ, z) = 1 when the probabilistic ensemble EDR for SOG-level ≥ 10%, and elsewhere r(ϕ, θ, z) = 0 (e.g., Ng et al. 2011;Sridhar et al. 2010). ( )  = -{  ( ) +   ( )}   ( ) {  +   ( , , )} .( 8)Equation ( 8) is the solution for the control parameter (ψ) that minimizes the cost function by Eq. ( 7) from departure to arrival.A full derivation of the analytic solution including F turb (t) is given in Appendix B. Solving Eqs. ( 4), ( 5), and (8) using the same shooting method used for the WOR described earlier, gives us the LTAR (red and green lines in Fig. 8) from LAX to JFK for the first case.This LTAR can be initiated at the departure time, however, it would be preferable to delay such a maneuver until closer to the forecasted turbulence constraint, because the maneuver decision needs to consider several factors like confidence of the weather forecast.In Fig. 8 (upper), the LTAR trajectory for the 10% SOG-level turbulence potential using 3.5-5.5 hr forecasts initiated from the departure (LAX) is depicted as a red line.The LTAR (red line) takes a total of 254 minutes flying time and used 6.7% extra time to entirely avoid the forecasted 10% SOG-level turbulence areas.Two other alternative LTARs were initiated 1.5 hrs (middle) and 2.5 hrs (lower) after departing LAX along the WOR (blue lines) with more recently updated forecasts data.An aircraft that follows the LTAR 1.5 hrs after departing LAX (middle in Fig. 8) has a flying time of 244 minutes, which saves 10 minutes more than that if it were to follow the LTAR initiated from the LAX (red line in upper in Fig. 8).However, if an aircraft follows an LTAR 2.5 hrs after departing LAX, when it is closer to more recently forecasted turbulence regions (lower in Fig. 8), it takes a total of 256 minutes of flying time.This is 2 minutes longer than the LTAR initiated from the departure (red line in upper figure in Fig. 8).Therefore, in this case, the most efficient LTAR is the one that begins its lateral detour 1.5 hrs after the departure (middle figure in Fig. 8).This takes 244 minutes from LAX to JFK, avoiding entirely all areas of SOG probability > 10%.Note that the example of LTARs shown in Fig. 8 may not be the most efficient maneuver, because there are several other ways to avoid the potential constraints of turbulence, such as tactical change of flight altitude and route just ahead of turbulence areas.
Summary and conclusionsIn this paper, the time-lagged ensembles of the EDR-scaled turbulence diagnostics computed from the high-resolution WRF-ARW model are used in automated ATM route planning and three example applications for re-routing around turbulence are given.The new turbulence forecasting techniques can create both deterministic and probabilistic turbulence information using a sequence of four procedures.These include highresolution weather modeling using time-lagged ensembles, calculation of reliable turbulence diagnostics on these grids, mapping of these metrics to an EDR-scale, and combining the predictions into a turbulence product.In the two cases presented here, 10 turbulence diagnostics derived from three time-lagged ensemble members are used to provide a total of 30 different turbulence forecasts.This system uses the operational GTG methodology with three modifications, which include the use of ( 1 Future work will use different thresholds instead of the 10% SOG probability to explore the tradeoffs between time/fuel used and penetrating certain portions of the turbulence area.In addition, when the fuel consumption model will be included in the cost function of Eq. ( 10), the current 2-D lateral turbulence avoidance route (LTAR) will be extended to 3-D maneuvers that minimize the fuel consumption and potentials of turbulence encounters during the total flight time.The strategic avoidance methodology suggested for turbulence herein can be also applied to other types of weather constraints such as icing, volcano ash, wind gust, and potential of contrail formation.Reducing the run-time would make the new method useful for tactical decisions such as near-term routing around convective weather as well.This can be accomplished by using data from a nowcast version of the GTG or output from a faster-running numerical model.Ng Hok Kwan, Todd Farley, and Dallas Denery at NASA Ames Research Center for their invaluable peer reviews.We also thank the editor (Todd D.

Appendix BPontryagin's Minimum Principle (Bryson and Ho 1975) is applied to the governing Eqs. ( 4) and ( 5) of the aircraft motion to determine the control parameter (heading angle of aircraft) that minimizes the cost function defined by Eq. ( 7) from the departure to arrival along the trajectory.The necessary condition for the control parameter and the optimal trajectory is that there exist continuously differentiable Lagrange multipliers (λ Φ , λ θ ).Using these the Hamiltonian is then, For the WOR that doesn't take into account the turbulence information, C t = 1 and C r = 0, which changes Eq.
