INTRODUCTIONThe design of aircraft navigation and flight-control systems has long followed a trend toward automation of the numerous guidance, control, and navigation functions once performed manually by the flight crew.Recently, this trend has accelerated and expanded in scope, with the momentum behind it being provided by the development of flight-worthy computers and by the increasing complexity of modern aircraft and of the air-traffic environment.Complex problems in all phases of aircraft operation indicate that such automation is not a lUxury, but rather a prerequisite for safe and economic flight.Wortunately, the timely development of airborne computers has provided the means to achieve the degree of automation required to alleviate these problems.Concepts have been proposed for flight-control systems capable of flying an aircraft automatically from takeoff to landing (refs. 1 and 2), with the pilot purely in the role of systems manager.Although such completely automatic systerr£ are now under study, this study focuses on the problem of automating a segment of the flight during which pilot workload is particularly heavy; the segment is within the terminal area, roughly within a 50-mile radius of an airport.For a subsonic jet transport on a landing approach, it corresponds approximately to the final 15 minutes of flight.Pilot workload in the terminal area is heavy as a result of deficiencies in the existing flight-control and air-traffic control systems.In this area, the aircraft often must be flown manually, even though an automatic landing system and an autopilot are on board.The automatic landing system can be used to fly the aircraft only along the final landing approach, after the aircraft is at the proper altitude, position, and heading to receive the Instrument Landing System (ILS) glideslope and localizer signals.Similarly, the standard autopilot has limited use in the earlier portions of terminal-area flight because it was never designed to provide precision flight-path control along the curyed, decelerating, and descending flight path which is frequently required before the final approach.The SJidance of aircraft in bUSy terminal areas, especially in weather conditions requiring instrument flight, is conducted primarily by air-traffic control.Controllers monitor the position and movement of aircraft on radar and issue guidance instructions to the pilots, who close the guidance loop by executing them as quickly and faithfully as possible.For landings, the controllers direct the randomly arriving aircraft into the final approach to achieve a high landing rate while maintaining a safe separation distance.The task is complicated by the differing airspeeds (and other performance characteristics) between aircraft on a common path.The pilot and controller workload of this system of terminal-area guidance has been studied for a number of high traffic terminal areas (ref.3).For arrivals into JFK International Airport, pilot-ATC communication requires as much as 50 percent of the last 10 minutes before touchdown.During this time, the pilot performs an average of 18 communications and navigation operations, a workload which pilots consider excessive.To reduce the pilot-ATC workload in the terminal area, an automatic flight-control system must provide precision flight-path control along the specified trajectory.In addition, the system must also maintain synchronization of the aircraft position with a specified time schedule; this requirement is especially important for efficient air-traffic control.All methods previously studied particularly stress the importance of maintaining accurate time-posi*ion control of aircraft in the terminal area (refs.[4][5][6].Accurate time-posi~ion control of the aircraft should reduce landing delays due to holding an~increase landing rates; however, it cannot be achieved with existing air-traffic control methods and equipment.What techniques are available for guiding an aircraft automatically along a specified time-position trajectory?The technique suggested in reference 1 is to precompute the trajectory in a ground facility, store it on tape, and enter it into the on-board system before takeoff.The on-board equipment would consist of a means for storing the precomputed trajectory and a modified autopilot for flying the aircraft along it.Although this technique requires only relatively simple on-board equipment, it suffers from severe practical disadvantages -the dependence on a ground facility and the difficulty of making fast trajectory changes in flight.For some segments of a flight, such as climb to and descent from cruise of a supersonic transport ~these disadvantages may not be significant.In terminal-area operations, however, even witb precise schedUling of aircraft, unexpected trajectory changes can never be completely eliminated, making the value of a precomputed trajectory very
Questionable.Few studies have addressed themselves to the synthesis of a terminal-area trajectory.AlthOUgh references 1 to 7 do not address this problem specifically, thcy do prOVide insight into the terminal control process and are helpful in identifying important problems.Reference 8 deals with the construction of holding patterns and path-stretching maneuvers.Reference 9 is particularly relevant because it defines several of the problems studied here.This study investigates a technique for calculating the trajectory on board, with provision for recalculating it in real time whenever changes are needed.The practicality of this technique hinges primarily on the solution of two problems.The first is to establish what guidance problems occur most frequently in the terminal area and can be solved by an on-board system.The second is to develop efficient computational techniques for synthesizing the required trajectories.The guidance problems to be solved are established from an analysis of air-traffic control procedures, instrument flight maneuvers, and terminal-area route structures.They can be divided into three principal subproblems: a lateral (horizontal) maneuver, a longitudinal (vertical) maneuver, and a speed change.An important assumption made in this study is that these three problems can be treated essentially independent of each other.A number of techniques are used to synthesize the trajectories; some are based on minimizing a specific performance function, others are derived from geometric considerations.In general, horizontal trajectories consist of connected segments of straight lines and circular arcs, while vertical trajectories consist only of connected segments of straight lines.Speed histories consist of sections of constant acceleration, constant deceleration, and constant speed flight.The choice of simple geometric shapes as basic building blocks yields trajectories that are easy to synthesize and that comply with all important aircraft maneuvering and performance constraints.There seems to be little reason to consider more complicated trajectories, at least for terminal-area operation of conventional aircraft.The basic information required to fly the synthesized trajectories is position, altitude, ground speed, and time.It is assumed that this information is available on board the aircraft.Although the description of the guidance laws derived herein is occasionally somewhat involved, programming experience has shown that the required computations can easily be performed on currently available airborne digital computers.(The development of a control system to fly the aircraft along the synthesized trajectory is closely related to standard autopilot design, and is not considered in this report.)
DEFINITION OF GUIDANCE PROBLEMS FOR TERMINAL-AREA OPERATIONSBefore trajectories can be synthesized, the set of guidance problems that occur in terminal-area operations must be defined and formulated mathematically.Such a set can never be considered complete because there is no limit to the number of possible problems.Therefore, the objective is to choose the set as small as possible, consistent with the requirement that the most commonly encountered guidance problems are included in it or can be reformulated in terms of problems in it.Terminal-area guidance can be viewed as the simultaneous solution of three types of problew£: horizontal (lateral) guidance, airspeed management, and vertical guidance.To simplify analysis, this study assumes that each type of problem can be solved essentially independent of the other two.Although this assumption is not always justified, it is motivated by observing that in commonly encountered flight conditions pilots tend to fly aircraft in a manner that allows them to solve these three types of problems independently.Although analysis of terminal-area guidance problerr£ is given separately for each type of problem, in practice, the three types of problems do interact.The method of dealing with these interactions is given when the problem is encountered.
Horizontal GuidanceThe most complex guidance problems in terminal-area oper-e't t ons for conventional transport aircraft involve horizontal maneuvers.The origin and identity of these problems are most easily explained by a brief discussion of the route structure and air-traffic control procedures for an ap~roach into a typical terminal area, that of San Francisco International Airport (SFO).The approach routes into SFO are indicated in figure 1 by the heavy broken lines.The most important feature is that they consist chiefly of connected sections of straight lines that terminate on the final approach.Transition from one straight-line section to another is achieved by means of smoothly rounded corners.The route structure can be specified by locating the corners defining each straight-line section and arrows indicating the direction of motion along each section.Corners often coincide with the location of a VOR station (such as Woodside) or at an intersection of radials from two adjacent VOR stations (such as Altamont).Under instrument flight conditions, air-traffic control closely monitors the movement of aircraft within the approach routes.The air-traffic controller sequences aircraft for landing, maintains separation between them within the routes, and vectors them onto the final approach with the desired s~acing.In the existing ATe system, a controller normally observes aircraft on radar and issues the appropriate guidance instructions to pilots by radio telephone.Maintaining the proper spacing between aircraft is especially critical on the final approach and at points of confluence of two or more segments.Too small a spacing is unsafe and may disrupt the smooth flow of traffic, whereas too large a spacing results in a low'landing rate.Spacing distances for the final approach are typically in the range between three and seven miles, the choice depending somewhat on the individual controller as well as weather conditions.In weather conditions requiring instrument flight, controllers tend to space aircraft at greater distances than in clear weather.Spacing is achieved by controlling the speed of the aircraft or, if necessary, by vectoring to control the length of the flight path to the point of confluence with the final approach.Vectoring the aircraft onto the final approach generally has the dual purpose of aiding the aircraft to acquire the ILS localizer and of ensuring the proper spacing between aircraft.Thus the route structure in the neighborhood of the point of confluence near the final approach (point A, figure 1) is variable and not necessarily as shown; the shaded region approximates the area within which the route may vary.Having described the terminal-area route structure and the air-traffic control problem, the next step is to isolate the basic horizontal guidance problems that an automatic system would have to solve in guiding the aircraft during the approach.Five problems have been identified and are described in the following sections under the heading of problems (a), (b), (c), (d), and path stretching.ProbZem (a)--Consider an aircraft point B (fig. 1) and is cleared for an aircraft are on the approach routes.)will be on the final approach path and that has just passed the corner at ILS approach.(Assume that no other The aircraft must be guided so that it headed in the landing direction at least by the time it passes the outer marker (OM).If it follows the approach route exactly as drawn in figure I, it achieves heading alignment at point A, a few miles before the OM.In general, an aircraft must be in close heading alignment with the final approach at or before thp.OM, if the approach is to continue successfully.Thus, the general problem is to guide the aircraft from any initial position and heading to a specified final position and heading, with the final position and heading achieved .simultaneously.This problem is illustrated by figure 2(a).Without some synthesis criterion there can be no unique solution to this problem, since for every combination of initial and final condition an infinite number of feasible trajectories can be found.Since a computer-oriented synthesis procedure requires unique solutions, the synthesis criterion was chosen as minimization of the path length of the trajectories connecting initial and final points.This criterion was suggested by the shape of the approach route segments (fig. 1) which show that once the trajectories have passed the last waypoint before the final approach they proceed by the most direct route to point A.An important constraint on the trajectories is that the bank angle required to fly along them not exceed some maximum value dictated primarily by passenger comfort considerations, typically 15°to 30°.The maximum bankangle constraint is, of course, equivalent to a constraint on the minimum turning radius; this equivalence is used in the synthesis procedure.ProbZem (b)--Major portions of terminal-area routes consist of straightline sections; if an aircraft is already flying along such a section, a standard lateral autopilot can keep it aligned.If, however, the aircraft is not on its assigned approach route, because the pilot or ATe have suddenly changed the route or a navigation error is discovered, then the problem arises of how to guide the aircraft onto the assigned route.This problem is the same as problem (a) when the new route must be entered at a specific point.Often, though, the only requirement is that the aircraft be flown onto the route as quickly as possible.Hence, problem (b) is defined as flying from any initial position and heading onto a straight line of specified location and heading.A solution to this problem is any trajectory that leads to the Specified line without violating maneuvering constraints.As in problem (a), the selected trajectory should minimi.zepath length without causing the aircraft to exceed a maximum bank angle.This problem is illustrated in figure 2{b), where the final line is assumed to be a VOR radial or the center line of the localizer.ProbZem (c)--Another method of specifying an approach route is to choose a sequence of waypoints t.hr'ough which the aircraft is to fly conaecut.LveIv , This method can also be used to generate holding patterns in a. simple way.If trajectories connecting consecutive waypoints are chosen to minimize the path length, approach routes quite similar to those in figure 1 can be obtained by a judicious placement of waypoints.Problem (c) is defined as flying from an arbitrary initial position and heading to a specified final position.As before, the synthesis criterion is chosen as the minimum path length, and the constraint is the maximum bank angle.This problem is similar to problem (a) except that the heading of the aircraft when it arrives at the final position or waypoint is not specified.Figure 2(c) illustrates the problem for two waypoints.FTobZem (dJ--If the approach routes are specified by connected segments of straight lines as in figure 1, a procedure is needed for transitioning from one segment to another without excess overshoot or high bank angles.Problem (d) is defined as determining a control law for making a transition between two straight-line segments at any specified angle of intersection.An ideal transition between two lines is shown in figure 2(d).Path stretahing--Air-traffic control was not considered in definin~problems (a) through (d), which arise in developing guidance laws for flying aircraft automatically along existing approach routes without regard to other aircraft.Air-traffic control requires knowledge of the location, heading, altitude, and speed of all aircraft operating in the terminal area.Since this knowledge is generally not available on board an aircraft, a comprehensive treatment of the air-traffic control problem from the point of view of an on-board system does not seem justified.It is reasonable, however, to consider on-board solution a portion of the air-traffic control problem that does not require explicit knowledge of other aircra•ft but would especially simplify the controller's job of spacing aircraft on final approach.This problem is to achieve precise arrival time of the aircraft at a designated point on the final approach or, in general, at any point on the approach route.TYPically, such points might be chosen as the OM or at the junction of two or more approach routes (i.e., point A, fig.1).The preferred technique of achieving a specified time of arrival at a specified point on the approach route is through speed control, which does not require deviation from the assigned approach route.The use of speed control for this purpose will be discussed in the next section.However, speed control alone is often inadequate, particularly if a change in the time of arrival is required close to the final point.The inadequacy of speed control is clearly shown when a speed lower than the stall speed is needed to achieve a delay in arrival time.Since late revisions in arrival time cannot be aVOided, this limitation of speed control may be overcome by stretching the approach path as required to achieve the desired delay.Path stretching to delay arrival time is an essential element of all manual and automatic air-traffic control systems that have been studied in the literature (refs. 4-8).Although there is generally no unique trajectory that increases the path length by a specified amount, the selection of a particular technique for path stretching is of great importance, since it is closely related to the method of air-traffic control.The effectiveness of path-stretching (and possibly also of path shortening) techniques is often evaluated in terms of the timing accuracy they achieve in delivering an aircraft at the desired point.Of those evaluated in simulations, no clearly superior technique has so far emerged.For a description and comparison of five different techniques see reference 4.Although optimum methods of path stretching have not been developed, the method chosen shOUld be able to increase the path length in a continuous manner while preserving as much as possible of the approach route.?urthermore, the calculations defining the stretched trajectory should be amenable to fast, on-line computer solution.Such considerations led to the particular method of path stretching described in detail later.To complete the definition of the problem, the path stretching is required to take place along a straight section of the approach on which a final point is specified.The path-stretching problem is then defined as selecting a trajectory that starts on the straight section, terminates on the final point, and has any specified arc length greater than the straight-line path.An example of a stretched path between two waypoints is shown in figure 2(e).Finally, the well-known holding pattern can be considered as an example of a stretched path.Generally, a path-stretching maneuver turns into a holding pattern whenever the increase in path length specified is greater than the circumference of a holding pattern.Holding patterns are not discussed further in this report.
Speed ControlThe primary purpose of speed control in the terminal area is to control time of arrival.In general terms, the problem is to calculate the speed-time or speed-position history of the aircraft so that it will arrive at a specified point on the approach route at a specified time.This ealculation assumes that the horizontal trajectory has already been determined by solving one or more of the trajectory problems defined in the preceding sections, so that the path length as well as the initial time ti and the final time tf are known.The speed-time history is calculated subject to the aircraft's operational constraints on cruise speed V, acceleration, and deeeleration.In addition to obeying these performance constraints, the initial speed V o of the speed-time history must equal the eurrent aircraft speed, and the final speed Vf must equal a specified value.If the final point happens to be the OM, then Vf may equal the final approach speed with fully lowered flaps.The "simplest" speed-time history that can solve this problem consists of three segments: an acceleration or deceleration segment to the cruise speed, a cruise-speed segment, and an acceleration or deceleration segment to the final speed, as in figure 2(f).Calculation of the speed-time history may reveal the need to apply path stretching to the horizontal trajectory.For example, the path length will need to be stretched if the calculated cruise speed is less than the minimum speed.
Vertical GuidanceFor the arrival operations considered in this report, vertical guidance is restricted to descent from cruise.(For departure operations, similar considerations are applicable to ascent to cruise.) the horizontal trajectory and the speed-time history solutions to previously defined problems.Here it is assumed that have been obtained as A typical altitude history, illustrated in figure 2(g), consists of segments of constant altitude and of descending flight.It commences at cruise altitude he and terminates at a final altitude hf approximately equal to the height above the runway of the ILS glides lope beam center at the OM.The descent profile provides for maintaining the cruise altitude as long as possible, then descending to the final altitude at a specified descent rate and at a constant forward speed.If any speed change is needed near the final point, it should be made in level flight; the descent profile must be planned to allow for the required period of level flight after the final altitude is achieved.Thus, the speed-time history (and horizontal trajectory) must be calculated before the altitude profile.
SummaryA complete terminal-area trajectory, consisting of the position, speed, and altitude of the aircraft as a function of time, is obtained by solving sequentially the horizontal, airspeed, and vertical guidance problems that are defined in this section and summarized in table 1.Although these are not the only problems that can be defined, they are sufficient for calculating the most frequently occurring trajectories in present-day terminal-area operations.(Important additional problems could be defined if information on the locations and trajectories of other aircraft in the area were available on board the aircraft, but such problems are not discussed in this study.)Solutions to the various problems discussed in this section are developed without explicitly considering the wind.Thus, they yield values for ground heading, ground speed, and ground acceleration time histories.If the wind speed and direction are known, as we assume in this study, these quantities can easily be converted to aircraft heading, airspeed, and acceleration with respect to the air mass.
TRAJECTORY SYNTHESIS FOR PROBLEM (a)In reference 9, trajectories were derived for problem (a) which are of minimum path length and are constrained by the minimum turning radius.When the initial and final points are separated by less than four turning radii, such trajectories can contain up to three partial turns of minimum turning radius.When the initial and final points are separated by more than four turning radii, the trajectories need only contain a straight-line segment with a partial turn of minimum turning radius at each end.In this section, a computer-oriented algorithm for calculating the trajectory is developed based on certain simplifying assumptions and on a geometric interpretation of the guidance problem.The trajectory patterns to be used in the development of the algorithm consist of at most two circular arcs and a straight-line segment.The threecircular-arc trajectories of reference 9 may occur in the minimum-are-length solution of problem (a) if the distance of separation between initial and final points is less then four turning radii.However, they are excluded here since they would increase the complexity of the algorithm and are expected to occur infrequently in practice.Another difference between reference 9 and the present development concerns the optimality of the trajectories generated by the algorithm.Reference 9 was devoted to a mathematical derivation of the minimum arc problem for problem (a).Here, for computational simplicity, the trajectories are not selected to minimize, in the strict mathematical sense, a specific performance function such as the arc length.Rather, the key criterion for selecting trajectories is geometric constructability; that is, the feasibility of constructing a particular type of trajectory for given initial and final conditions.Because the trajectories for which a feasible construction is sought are known to be optimum under some conditions, as shown in reference 9, the procedure can be expected to yield an efficient trajectory, though not necessarily the true optimum one in the minimum arc sense.The disadvantage of not always generating trajectories that minimize a performance function is outweighed by the geometric insight which the algorithm casts upon the horizontal guidance problem.It was stated previously that the trajectories should obey a constraint on the maximum bank angle.At constant airspeed V a constraint on the minimum turning radius Rmin is equivalent to a constraint on the maximum bank angle ~ax' The relationship between these constraints is given by the following equation: V2 g tan ~max where g is the acceleration of gravity.The value of V used in equation ( 1) should be the maximum ground speed encountered during the maneuver.An acceptable estimate would be to choose it as the sum of the maximum airspeed in the terminal area and the wind speed.In further calculations, the turning radius is treated as a parameter whose value is arbitrary and is related to the bank-angle constraint.The trajectories in this study are chosen from the 13 basic patterns shown in the left column of table 2. (The additional patterns shown in the right column of table 2 are required for the complete minimum arc solution of problem (a), and are not used in the algorithm.)The patterns used are composed of three or fewer segments; each segment consists of a portion of either a straight line or a circle.Under the maneuver symbol column in table 2, each pattern is assigned a maneuver symbol, characterizing the consecutive maneuvers required to fly the trajectory.For instance, L S L stands for left turn, straight flight, and left turn.These symbols are used throughout the text to refer to a particular pattern.
Pattern ParametersThe assignment of a flight pattern depends on the initial and final conditions of the problem, represented by the coordinates of the initial point and the initial heading and by the coordinates of the final point and the final heading.For the purpose of pattern assignment and the calculation of pattern constants, the initial and final conditions can be reduced to three parameters or states.The symbols Po and P f denote the initial and the final point and W o and Wf the initial and the final heading, respectively.Since Wf is normally the runway heading, the initial heading is conveniently measured with reference to Wf.The initial heading thus measured is denoted by wand is given by W= W o -Wf.Unit vectors no and nf have directions W o and Wf and emanate from Po and Pf, respectivelY (fig.3).If nand nf are not parallel or antiparallel, lines drawn through no and nf, ~ermed the "initial" and "final" lines, will intersect at a point P v' The case where these lines do not intersect is referred to as the singular case and is considered separately elsewhere.The pattern parameters for the nonsingular case are W, d , and d f.A positive W is defined by rotating n f clockwise into no' ~e range of W is -~< W5 ~, with W in radians.~eother two parameters are do and dw here do is the signed distance PoP v and d f is the signed distance PvPf.The sign of a distance is positive if the corresponding unit vector points away from P v' The geometric construction of these parameters and a typical trajectory are illustrated in figure 3.The two parameters do and df are not directly measured, but must be computed from available navigation measurements.The computation is aided by relating them to a commonly used Cartesian coordinate system.As illustrated in figure 3, the origin of the coordinate system is at P f; its x-axis points in the direction of nf, and its y-axis points to the right of the reference direction.This coordinate system is often used in aircraft guidance and control studies.Let (x,y) be the coordinate vector of Po in this system, normalized by using the turning radius R as the unit of distance: (x',y') = (x/R,y/R).Then do = y'/sin W, andd f = -x' + y'/tan W, or do = Y R sin JjJ d f x Y = -R'+ R tan W(3 )
IThe quantities do and d f are also normalized distances.Equations ( 2) and(3) are valid for all JjJ except JjJ = 0 or JjJ = ~, corresponding to the singular cases.In an actual computer mechanization, $ will be considered zero or rr when it lies in the neighborhood of these values.
Switching PointsOur objective in the next several sections is to describe how flight patterns are assigned as a function of the three parameters ~,do' and d f and to determine those combinations of parameters, called the sWitching points, at which changes from one type of pattern to another occur.Although the switching points can be functions of all three parameters, the pattern assignment problem is simplified by choosing many of the switching points as dependent only on ~,and the others as simple functions of ~and do.The pattern assignment problems are different for nonsingular and for singular values of ~; the assignment problem for the nonsingular case is considered first.All switching points are defined by points of tangency involving the initial or the final line and certain circles which arise in the geometric construction of flight patterns.The six switching points on the initial line are P -, P " P -, P Q' P +, and P +, and the six switching uoints on the
Flight Patterns for Normal ManeuversThe "normal" flight patterns apply, and the derivation of switchin" points is simplest, if the initial and final points are far apart compared to the turning radius.Figure 4 illustrates the trajectories for this case with an acute and an obtuse value of ~for 0 $ ~$ n.Each part of the figure shows four trajectories corresponding to four pairs of initial and final conditions, with designations corresponding to those in table 2. (Circles involved in the construction of the trajectories are comuleted by broken lines.)The region of large separation between initial and final points can now be defined more precisely as the set of initial and final conditions for which neither of the two initial circles intersects either of the two final circles.In this region, the four trajectories shown in figures 4(a) and 4(b) can always be drawn.The boundaries of these regions can be defined by studying the figures as either the initial or final point moves along its line.The trajectory starting at POI and ending at P f l is of the type.As Pfl moves down, the trajectory changes to the RSL type left initial circle becomes tangent to do at switching point Pf~'tance of P f & from P v is d f &= tan ~!2.

OctFrom symmetry, trajectories for the negative 1J; range, -n < 1J; < 0, can be taken as the mirror images of trajectories for the positive 1J; range reflected about the do axis.The reflection of trajectories for negative 1J; values is essentially equivalent to the introduction of another switching point at 1J; = O.This reflection procedure for negative 1J; is also valid for near-distance maneuvers.
Flight Patterns for Near-Distance l1aneuversIf the initial and the final points are so close that at least one pair of initial and final circles intersect, the flight patterns given in the preceding section may become invalid.Flight patterns for this condition are referred to as near-distance maneuvers.Near-distance maneuVers rarely occur in terminal-area operation of aircraft and should alw~ys be avoided since the resulting disruption of aircraft on landing approach can cause landing delaYS.Nevertheless, events that generally require near-distance maneuvers, such as go-arounds and emergencies, do occur in a small but not negligible percentage of takeoffs and approaches.Therefore, no automati c terminal guidance system is complete unless it can also handle such events.Pattern selection rules for near-distance maneuvers are somewhat involved.Readers not interested in following these details may go directly to the next section, on switching diagrams, where the selection rules are summarized.When Po is to the left of P -, two groups of switching ~oints are fy P f& merge into a single point.For initial points to the left of P oa' initial and final circles do not intersect, and the region is as discussed in the preceding section.The upper limit of P f& is P f 6, reached when POl is at P -.  the assignment of trajectories for all combinations of the pattern parameters.
Derivation of Switching FunctionsThe next step is to derive the analytical expressions not yet given for some SWitching points.An essential step in the derivation is to solve for various parts of the right triangle P v' Co, P~own in figure 7. Since all circles in the construction have unit radiUS, PvC o = /1 + da and W2 = ¢ + tan-1 lido where do is negative in this example.Now A complete collection of all switching functions, along with their domains of definition, is given in table 3.
Switching DiagramsThe various regions of trajectory patterns in the three-dimensional parameter space ($, do, df) can be illustrated with switching diagrams which consist of planar cuts through this space obtained by holding one of the three parameters constant.When W is constant, the switching diagrams are as shown in figures 8(a), (b), and (c) for three values of W: n/4, n/2, and 3n/4.Each region is labeled with the pattern type established for it in the preceding sections.On the region boundaries, the four types of threesegment patterns often degenerate to one-or two-segment patterns, as indicated by the coded lines.In addition to giving a compact representation of pattern regions, the switching diagrams find use in developing decision logic for pattern type selection.The switching diagrams show that for W = n/4 and 3n/4, doS = doo' The line segment d f a is terminated on the left by d f y for W < 3n/4 and by doS for W~3n/4, as shown by the two inserts in figure 8(c).No other changes in the structure of the switching diagrams occur as $ is varied in the range 0 < $ < n.Flight Patterns for W= 0 and W = n Radians For the two singUlar values of $, W= 0 and W = n radians, the parameters do and d f are not defined.Instead, the par~~eters used are the rectangular coordinates of the initial point, Po' expressed in the X,Y coordinate system of figure 3.This coordinate system is centered at Pf and has its x-axis pointing in the direction of the final heading.Unlike the parameter space (do, d f), the parameter space (X, y) preserves the geometric shapes of figures under mappings; therefore pattern assignment and switching diagrams can be combined in one figure .Switching diagrams, as well as example trajectories, are given for W =0 in figure 9(a) and for $ = n radians in figure 9(b).For both values of W, the switching curves which separate the parameter space into regions of different patterns are either straight lines or portions of circles with radius 2. For W = 0, one circle is centered at (0,-2), the other at (0,2).For $ = n, the one circle is centered at the origin.These circles define the locus of initial points for which an initial circle is tangent to a final circle.The switching diagrams are symmetric about the x-axis.This symmetry is also present in the pattern assignment; for a given value of X, trajectories in the negative Y plane are the mirror images of trajectories in the positive Y plane.Several sample trajectories are superimposed on the switching diagrams to illustrate the pattern assignment.
Derivation of Path-Length EquationIn preceding sections, rules were derived for choosing a particular trajectory for each initial position and heading of an aircraft.The next step is to derive equations for calculating the path length and the heading changes in the first and final turns for each trajectory.?or the RSR trajectory between Po and P f in figure lOCal, Po is at (x,v), the initial heading is ~, and the turning radius is R.

TRAJECTORY SYNTHESIS FOR PROBLEMS (b), (c), (d)Optimum control laws for the minimum-path-length trajectories of problems (b) and (c) are derived in reference 9. To complete the solution of these horizontal trajectory problems, equations are required for the path length and the turning angles of the optimum trajectories.In addition, computer algorithms are needed for the implementation of the control laws.Purther, a solution to problem (d) is necessary.As in the previous section, distances are normalized to units of turning radius.initial points to the right of the final line if one faces in the direction of the final heading.The heading ~is positive for a clockwise rotation from the direction of the final line, and its range is -n < ~i n.Solid SWitching lines with arrows indicate the direction a phase point travels toward the origin.The switching lines and the dashed lines separate the phase plane into various regions.Each switching line and region is labeled with its respective pattern type.Reference 9 shows that the optimum trajectories for this problem consist at most of three segments, with the mIddle segment a straight line and the first and last segments portions of minimum-radius circles.In the phase plane, right and left turns with unity turning radius are parameterized by the equations (right turn) (28 )~I1I111g111IIMI 1I 1I I 1 d (W) = d -cos W + cos W 9- 0 0 (left turn)where do and W o are the phase points where the turns are initiated.Straight-line flight generates a line ~arallel to the d axis.The switchinl ines are special cases of these phase plane trajectories and are labeled 81 through 86 in the switching diagram.The equations for the switchin~lines, along with their domain of definition, are required by the computer al~orithm to select the correct pattern type for a given initial condition:8 1 (W) = 1 cos W W ~[0, 'If/2] (30) 82 (W) = 1 + cos W -'If /2 ,; w ,; ' If (31 ) 83 (W) = -1 + cos W W ~[0, -'If/2] (32) 8 4(d) = -'If!2 d :: 1 (33) S5(d) = 'If!2 d S -1 (34 ) 86(W) = -1 -cos W -'If < W S 'If!2(35 )The dashed lines which also form portions of the boundaries between pattern regions do not represent phase-plane trajectories.Instead, they define the set of initial points for which two trajectory tyPes yield equal path length.For example, the R8R trajectory and the L8R trajectory yield the same value for the path length for initial conditions on the dashed line segment W = 'If/2, d ~1.For definiteness, one of the minimum-path-length trajectories is arbitrarily assigned to such points of ambiguity.The phase trajectories for eight initial conditions (P a -Ph) are traced out in figure 12, and their corresponding geometric patterns are shown in figure 13.Parametric equations ( 28) and (29) for the phase-plane tra,iectories, together with the switching diagram, are used to derive equations for turning angles and for the length of the straight-line portion of the various patterns.Table 5 lists these equations and their region of validitv for all trajectory types beginning with a left turn.Equations for the mirror-image trajectories are obtained by reversing the signs of wand d. wor examnle, if d and ware such that the switching diagram specifies an R8R trajectory, the signs of d and ware reversed, then entered into the equations for the LSL trajectory given in table 5.Finally, the switching diagram (fig.12), equations (30) through (35), and the equations in table 5 can be used to construct a flow chart for trajectory synthesis (fig.14).The input to the flow chart is d and W, and its , rrr-n-v-'--f" J the situation by setting index i r = 2.After the ~attern narameters are computed, i r is checked; if it is 2, the pattern is reversed to its mirror ima~e.
Trajectory Synthesis for Problem (c)Problem (c) is to fly from a given initial position and heading to a specified final point with an unspecified final heading.The control law that minimizes arc length, derived in reference 9, is shown in figure 15(a), with distances normalized to the unit turning radius.The location of the final point is expressed in a coordinate system which has its origin at the initial position, Po, its x-axis pointing in the direction o? the initial headin~, and its y-axis pointing to the right.The switching lines in this control law are the x-axis and two circles with unit radii and centers at (0,-1) and (0,1).Trajectories for points on the negative x-axis can be taken as either LS or RS with no change in path lengLh; they are arbitrarily made RS.Example trajectories for four final points are shown in figure 15(b).Equations for the path length and turning angles, and the flow chart for trajectory synthesis, are determined next.Symmetry in the control law reduces the complexity of the trajectory constants and algorithm.Only the positive y-plane need be considered, since trajectories for the negative y-plane can be obtained by reflection about the x-axis.Then the switching logic need only determine whether a final Doint is inside or outside the unit circle at (0,1), and the path length and turning angle equations are easily derived by simple trigonometry.Table 6 summarizes the equations and their region of validity; ~i denotes the angle in the initial turn, ~f the an~le in the final turn, and ~the length of the straight-line segment.(The arctangent is an angle ~in the range -TI < ~< n.)The flow chart for trajectory synthesis, shown in figure 16, is an imnlementation of figure 15(a) and table 6.It has as inputs the x,y coordinates of the final noint, and as outputs the trajectory pattern, turning angles, and path length.~or purnoses of developing this flow chart, each pattern was assigned an integer, which is represented in the chart by the index i p ' The correspondence between the pattern types and this index is given in the chart.
Trajectory Synthesis for Problem (d)Problem (d) is to make a smooth transition from flight along one straightline segment to flight along a second, intersecting straight-line segment.The distance from the aircraft to the point of intersection along the first se~nent is Xi, and the distance from the point of intersectlon to a desired final point on the second segment is xf.Angle ~is the heading difference between the two segments; since the segments intersect, ~i s neither zero nor TI.To make the transition without overshoot, the aircraft should begin a circular turn of radius R at a dista~ce before the intersection point given by= R t.an ill 2 W < if, or(36)When proper account is taken of the circular segment, the total path length between xi and xf is
CONTROLLED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND VERTICAL GUIDANCEThe problem of achieving precise arrival time of an aircraft at some point on the final approach or any other specified point of the approach route generally consists of selecting both a speed profile and a horizontal trajectory of appropriate length such that the aircraft-, starting with initial speed V o arrives at the end point with speed Vf in the time interval t.As explained earlier, we first attempt to achieve the desired arrival time with speed control alone, assuming that the horizontal trajectory, and therefore the path length, is fixed.If it is found that speed control cannot achieve the desired arrival time because the aircraft's performance capabilities are exceeded, the path length will be modified as required to control the arrival time.Solution of the controlled time of arrival problem therefore involves two algorithms, one to select the speed profile, assuming a fixed length of trajectory to the final point, the other to change the length of the trajectory by an appropriate amount.
Speed Control'The problem of speed profile selection is considered first.The time to the final point and the length of the path are denoted by t and L, respectively.In addition to beginning with V o and ending with Vf, the speed V along the profile must at all times obey the constraint Vmin ~V ~V max.Speed changes are made by constant acceleration A a (numerically positive) or constant deceleration Ad (numerically negative).These six quantities, t, L, Vmin, V max, A a, and Ad' are treated as ~arameters in develouing logic for speed profile selection.The speed profile cOQsists of a maximum of three segments: an acceleration or deceleration segme~starting at V o, a constant speed segment, and another acceleration or deceleration segment ending at Vf. Unless one or more of the segments has zero time duration, the three segments can be arranged to yield four possible speed profiles.The profile to be used is selected by comparing the path length L with two distances, LI andL2: Vot + (V f -V o)2 V :;; V f (38) 2A a 0 LI = (V _ 1! )2 V t - f 0 V V f(V t + (V f -V O)2 V Z V f (40) 0 2A d 0 L 2 = (V f -V o)2 Vft - v S Vi: (41) 2A 0 awhere L1 is the minimum, and L 2 the maximum distance to fly in interval t when speed is between V o and Vf.The relation between the required speed profile and the distances L1 and L2 is shown in figure 17, where V n is the aircraft speed in the constant-speed segment.The distances L1 and L2 are represented by the shaded areas of the speed profiles in the left-hand column of figure 17.The profiles to be used are in the right-hand column.The required profiles are selected by comparing the shaded areas of left-hand colQ~profiles with those of the right.If L < L1, the required profile consists of deceleration, constant speed, and acceleration; if L > L2, the required profile consists of acceleration~constant speed, and deceleration.For L1 S L S L2, the required profile consists of deceleration, constant speed, and deceleration segments if V o > V f , or of acceleration, constant speed, and acceleration segments if V o < V f.The "pz-of'd Le constants 1I are the second-segment speed V n, starting time t1 and ending time t2' With permissible acceleration (or deceleration) of aj in the first segment and a3 in the third segment, V n is computed by equating L with the area under the speed-history curve:(v '_ V ) 2 n 0 2a1 (v n _ V )2 f (42)Equation ( 42) is quadratic in V n and can be exnressed asV 2 (-L _-L) + v ~+ V V) (V2 V2 ) = 0 ...2._...1:. + _f __ -2._ (43) n 2a3 2al n a1 a3, 2a32a1After solving for V n, the remaining profile constants t l and t2 are(44) (45)The profile is physically me&~ingful only if t1 S t2;

thus the tangents required to complete the pattern can always be constructed.The relationship between the direct path length L d (the distance between Po and Pf) and the stretched-path length L s is plotted in figure 20.The location of the center of circle C3 on the locus of centers (fig.19) is a parameter.Between PA and PC, the parameter is Ss; beyond PC, the parameter is the perpendicular distance YC3 between the center of C3 and the line connecting Cj and C2 in units of turning radii.Wor any fixed value of L d in the interval of [4,00), the value of L s increases continuously as C3 moves along the locus of centers starting from point PA' Moreover, it can be concluded from the characteristics of these curves that for any ~iven combination of values of (Ld, L ), where L d t [4,00) and L s 2 L d, a unique curve intersects point (Ld, L s)' The parameter value that ~enerates that intersecting curve defines the solution of the path-stretching nroblem.The equation for the unknown value of the parameter is nonlinear in the parameter and can be solved by known techniques; it is derived in the appendix.
Algorithm for Controlled Time of ArrivalThe algorithm for synthesizing controlled time-of-arrival profile consists of speed-control, path-stretching, and decision lo~ic (fig.21).The profile is synthesized in three steps:(1) Determine Lmin and Lmax' the minimum and maximum distances the aircraft is capable of traversing, for the given Yo' Vf, A a, Ad' V max' Vmin, and t.(2) Determine if L is within the range of [Lmin, Lmax], (a) if L < Lmin' stretch the path length to L s so that Lmin < L s < Lmax and proceed to step 3, (b) if L > Lmax' return message stating that the given time t is too short for the aircraft to traverse the given distance L, (c) if Lmin S L $ Lmax' proceed to step 3.(3) Determine the profile pattern and compute profile constants V n , tj, and t2'The distances Lmax and Lmin correspond to the areas under speed-profile curves whose constant-speed segments are flown at V max and Vmin, and are computed by substituting the speed and acceleration limits into equation (42):L = V t maX max = V t max (V _ V )2 max 0 2A a (V _ V )2 (V -V f)2 max 0 max (46) 2A a 21 A d l (V mi n _ V )2 (V. -V )2 0 + mln f 2A d 2A a _ V . )2 nun 2A a (47)When t is too short for the aircraft to accelerate to V max at A a , the corresponding maximum-distance profile consists of two segments: an acceleration segment from Va to V u «V max ) , and a deceleration segment from V up to Vf.The upper speed, V up' ts computed by equating the sum of the time duration of the two segments to t:Upon rearranging terms, v up(48)The area under the curve isV up -V V up -V L V tl + 0 tl + Vf(t -t l) + f (t -t I) " max a 2 2 V~p _ V 2 va p _ V2 0 f = + 2A 2/ A d l a(49 )Similarly, the minimum-distance profile for small t segments: a deceleration segment from Va to Vi (a speed ~~d an acceleration segment from Vi to Vf• ~or Vi' consists of two greater than Vmin), = t

53)Second, a comparison is performed to ascertain that the controlled time of arrival can be accomplished by speed control alone.If not, then the given nominal path length L is increased to L s by path stretching as specified by k:where 0 < k < 1.Third, the path length L (or L s ) is compared with Ll and L2 to determine the pattern for the speed profile, and the trajectory constants are computed by equations ( 43), (44), and (45).
Time ReferenceIn the controlled-time-of-arrival problem, time-to-go is an important variable to pilot and air-traffic controller.As arrival time approaches, air traffic control must know by how much this time can still be changed.The earliest arrival time tmin and the latest arrival time t max achievable by speed control alone are(v -V )2 + (V max -V f)2 L + max 0 2A t '" __ a min V max (V -"V )2 (V f -v mi n ) 2 L - o min ~- 2A t a '" max V mi n(56)These times could be used as decision variables instead of Lm ax and Lmin in the algorithm.If t < tmin, the trajectory is beyond the aircraft's capability.If tmin S t s tmax' the controlled time of arrival can be accomplished by speed control alone, but if t > t max, path stretching is also required.
Vertical GuidanceCriteria for generating the vertical profile were described earlier.The vertical profile is defined by the time to begin descent to the desired final altitude.This time is calculated by subtracting from the specified arrival time, t, the time intervals required to change the approach speed to the specified final speed in level flight, and to change the cruise altitude to the final altitude.The first time interval is profile constant t2, available from the already calculated speed-time history, and the second interval is given by (h c -hf)/h.
SummaryThis section has developed procedures for synthesizing speed profiles to achieve specified arrival times at specified points on the approach path, and for modifying the length of the approach path if the speed profile required for a specified arrival time is outside the aircraft's performance envelope.A simple technique for vertical guidance was also described.The simplicity of the technique resulted from the use of parameters already calculated in the synthesis of horizontal and airspeed profiles.The synthesis algorithms discussed in this and the previous sections are illustrated in the next section by an example.
OVERALL FLIGHT PROFILE SYNTHESIS -AN EXAMPLEA numerical example will be used to illustrate how a complete, threedimensional trajectory with time constraints may be synthesized by applying the techniques developed for horizontal guidance, controlled time of arrival, and vertical guidance.It is assumed that an aircraft has reached the last waypoint before the outer marker.Wind velocity is assumed to be zero.If it is not, the trajectory to be synthesized must be modified somewhat to account for the wind velocity.
Problem DescriptionConsider an aircraft whose current position is 21.8 km (13.56 miles) from the OM at an azimuth of 292°.It has a heading of 216°, an altitude of 1520 m (5000 ft), and a speed of 149.6 m/sec (290 knots).The flight profile to be synthesized must guide the aircraft to arrive at the OM six minutes later, aligned with the runway at a final altitude of 456 m (1500 ft) and a final speed of 67 m/sec (130 knots).The acceleration and deceleration capability of the aircraft is 0.61 m/sec 2 (2 ft/sec 2), and the maximum and minimum speeds of the aircraft are 154.5 m/sec (300 knots) and 67 m/sec (130 knots).The sink rate (rate of change of altitude) is 305 m/min (1000 ft/min).The aircraft must maintain cruise altitude (1520 m in this case) as long as possible, descend at constant speed, and hold altitude during speed changes.A minimum turning radius of 6.45 km (4 miles) is used during horizontal maneuvers.The conditions ~~d constraints for this example are summarized in figure 22.As outlined earlier, the complete profile of the aircraft's time-position relationship is synthesized in three sequential steps: horizontal guidance, controlled time of arrival, and vertical guidance.Each subproblem and its methods of solution are discussed separately.After the complete profile is solved, it is summarized as a command sequence, which gives the order~initiation times, and termination times of commands required to fly the profile.
Horizontal GuidanceFrom the description of the example, the horizontal guidance problem is classed as problem (a), and steps for synthesis are: (1) compute pattern parameters, (2) determine the flight pattern, and (3) compute turning angles, linear path length, and total path length.First, the pattern parameters do and df are computed using equations (2)  and(3
Controlled Time of ArrivalThe numerical inputs for this problem are those specified in figure 22, with the addition of the path length, 34lan (21.1 miles), obtained in the preceding section.The logical path traced in synthesizing the speed profile is shown with heavy lines in figure 23.At node Lh, the time interval, 6t2, for the maximum distance profile is computed to be 208.1 seconds.Since 6t 2 is positive, the maximum distance profile consists of three segments.Next, Lmax, the distance corresponding to this profile, is computed before node ~: Since the given distance L for this problem (34 kID) is less than Lmax, the profile synthesized is within the aircrart's capability.(V max V )2 (V -V )2Similarly, at node L1, 6t2 for the minimum distance profile is computed to be 225 seconds.The positive value for 6t2 implies that the minimum distance profile contains a constant speed segment.Before node &-., the distance corresponding to this profile is computed and then compared with L:(V f -V • ) 2 mln + 2A a (V _ V .

CONCLUSIONSThe technique developed in this report for automating terminal-area guidance, when properly implemented, enables an aircraft to fly from a given initial position, altitude, heading, and airspeed to a specified final position, altitude, heading, and airspeed in a prescribed time.The technique is based on the formulation of a class of principal subproblems in terms of which any flight profile can be expressed from takeoff to landing.The required SUbproblems are established by a study of air-traffic control procedures, instrument-flight maneuvers, and terminal-area route structures.They are:(1) Horizontal guidance: (a) Guiding an aircraft from any initial position and heading to a specified final position and heading, (b) guiding an aircraft from any initial position and heading onto a straight line of specified location and heading, (c) gUiding ~~aircraft from any initial position and heading to a specified final position, and (d) guiding an aircraft smoothly from one straight line onto another intersecting straight line.(2) Controlled time of arrival: selected horizontal trajectory) from speed in a specified time interval.Guiding an aircraft (along the prean initial airspeed to a specified final (3) Vertical guidance: Guiding an aircraft (along the preselected horizontal trajectory and speed profile) from an initial altitude to a specified final altitude.The criterion used for selection of the horizontal trajectory is to minimize the total path length subject to the constraint imposed by a minimum turning radius.The horizontal trajectory consists of arcs of circles and segments of straight lines which form a confluent path connecting the initial and final points.It is synthesized in two steps: ?irst, a flight pattern is assigned, then arc lengths and straight-line distances are computed to specify the horizontal trajectory completely.For the speed-profile synthesis, the horizontal distance determined already is compared with the maximum and minimum distances the aircraft can traverse (for the specified initial speed, final speed, time of arrival, maximum and minimum allowable speed, and acceleration and deceleration capabilitv).If the horizontal path length is greater than the maximum distance, no speed profile is possible.If it is between the minimum and maximum distance, speed variation alone can control time of arrival.If it is below the minimum distance, path stretching of the horizontal trajectory is necessary, and the controlled time of arrival is achieved by a combination of speed control and path stretching.When the horizontal trajectory and the speed profile are determined, the vertical guidance trajectory is synthesized.The criterion for this synthesis is maintaining cruise altitude as long as possible consistent with the specified descent rate and with the required final altitude.A composite command profile is generated by superimposing the alreadv determined horizontal, speed, and vertical profiles.Essentially, this command profile is a time history of commands (such as decelerate, turn left, and descend) to be issued at the proper time.This profile can provide automatic guidance of an aircraft for transitioning from any initial state to any soecified final state, where a state is specified by the aircraft coordinates, altitude, speed, heading, and the clock time.In general, the overall flight profile of an aircraft, starting from takeoff to landing, may be decomposed into a sequence of waynoints.The flight profile for each pair of adjacent waypoints can readily be synthesized by applying the various guidance problems discussed.Therefore, the overall flight profile, starting from takeoff to landing, may be synthesized by concatenation of flight profiles for consecutive pairs of waypoints.The advantage of this technique lies in its versatility and efficiency.It requires no pre computation of trajectories, and can provide fast, in-flight cha~ges in trajectory as required.Since the only aircraft parameters used in synthesizing the trajectories are performance limitations, the technique is applicable to any aircraft.Finally, by synthesizing trajectories subject only to aircraft performance limitations and ATC constraints, the technique uses airspace efficiently and therefore makes possible reduction of separation requirements and thus achieves higher landing rates.------------------------------           '" ,...     ---

to define the trajectories.The first group contains the points P f y' P f&, and P Oa' If in figure 4(a) or 4(b) the points POl and P f 2 move simultaneously toward the origin, they will reach positions where the straight-line segment of the RSL trajectory vanishes and the right initial circle becomes tangent to the left final circle.There are generally two possible final circles tangent to the line dr and to the initial circle; in figure 5(a), points of tangency of the final circles with dr are denoted by P f y for the further of the two points and by P f& for the nearer of the two from the origin.The positions of these two points are functions of the position of P .as P moves back to the left to P -, the noints of tangency P -and 01
