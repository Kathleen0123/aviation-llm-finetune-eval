rather, it is used by the sector controllers primarily to indicate landing-slot availability to which they may assign any aircraft.Current sequencing and metering does not use spacing dependent on the weight classes of aircraft.However, the AAR or VARs can be changed at any time, which will change the timeintervals for sequencing aircraft.Although the FAA specifies minimum separations for the final approach based on the sequence of aircraft weight classes, this information cannot be used in sequencing and spacing for aircraft delivery to the TRACON, unless the runway destinations are known as each aircraft enters the Center and unless aircraft heading for different vertexes are on separate flightpaths.In the discussion of the scheduling methods proposed here, it is assumed that the runway destinations are known as the aircraft enter the Center, and that aircraft destined for different runways are on separate flightpaths so that the scheduling problems for different vertexes are independent of each other.In practice, this is true for most aircraft.If, occasionally, different runways are assigned for a few aircraft, this will somewhat increase the predicted delays.In the approach followed here, several methods of scheduling the traffic for one vertex are applied one after the other, each method improving upon the next.As in the ASP operational system, in the system proposed here, scheduling is always begun with FCFS ordering.With this method, after aircraft enter the ARTCC, they are sequenced in the order in which they are predicted to land by their ETA sequence, while using a flight plan which specifies the nominal path.For greatest fuel efficiency, the Trajectory Synthesizer, which calculates the ETAs, also needs to know on which runway the aircraft is to land as soon as it enters the Center airspace.In contrast to ASP with its equal time spacing between aircraft, the CTAS FCFS sequencer adds appropriate delay times to insure proper spacing, which depends on the weight classes of the aircraft.There are two additional distinct differences compared to the ASP: For the heuristic time-advance method, which was analyzed in a previous report (ref.4) a constant ta of 1 minute was used for all delays, and the leading aircraft of a group was time-advanced only if it would benefit at least one following aircraft.In the earlier system implementation of TA (ref. 1) there was a choice of between 0 and 4 aircraft that must follow the leader of the group without a gap in the sequence before it is time-advanced.This could occasionally be wasteful.Assuming the ETAs are approximately spaced as required for FCFS, TA would force all aircraft in the group unnecessarily to fly faster.Also, a small group may be closely followed by a large group, then, if the small group is not time-advanced, the large group may have an insufficient gap to timeadvance it for minimum fuel costs.Two additional elements were missing in the heuristic TA implementation.First, it was not known what is the best amount of ta to choose for the prevailing demand, and second, it was not known how many aircraft should be time-advanced.In this updated report these elements are addressed, and presented in a simple algorithm which has now been implemented in the real time system described in reference 1.The data will still be presented for the heuristic TA algorithm, since the data trends for different traffic conditions that were reported earlier do not change for an improved TA algorithm.The spacing requirements mentioned earlier offer the opportunity to optimize the landing sequence further, thereby improving on the FCFS and TA methods by minimizing the average delay per aircraft.A scheduling optimizing method called constrained position shift (CPS)was developed several years ago by Dear (ref. 5).The CPS method assumes that an initial landing order has been determined by FCFS and that all aircraft are tightly packed, tha t is, that they have minimum time-separations.By rearranging the landing order, while not shifting any aircraft from its original position in the sequence by more than a few places, the total time between the first aircraft and the last aircraft can often be reduced.Another method of optimization, the branch-and-bound technique, was used in an ATC advisory system called COMPAS (ref.6).Both optimization methods, CPS find branch-and-bound attempt to sequence incoming aircraft in such a manner as to minimize the total delay for all aircraft, and for both methods various restrictions apply in order to obtain feasible solutions.Three of these methods o_ scheduling, FCFS, TA, and
CPS have been implemented in a Traffic ManagementAdvisor (TMA) Station, which is part of an automated system for the management of arrival traffic (ref.1).The sequencer in this system permits the selective use of any combination of these scheduling schemes, and it contains other features that are important for the human interaction with the automated sequencer but which are not discussed in the present report.Besides describing the scheduling methods, the purpose of this report is to statistically evaluate those that are implemented in the TMA.This is done using a large number of realistic traffic samples to determine their overall effect on aircraft delays.Additionally, the analysis is used to show the effects of other variables on delays such as traffic distributions, lengths of traffic samples, and winds.Also, the initial analysis of the results for an optimal time-advance algorithm and an optimal singleposition-shift CPS, both of which cannot be implemented in an operational ATC system, permitted the design of an improved TA algorithm and of a heuristic CPS that are being implemented in the CTAS system.First, the three scheduling algorithms, FCFS, TA, and CPS will be discussed, wherein each successive algorithm improves on the preceding one by further reducing the average delay for all aircraft.Then, a model of incoming traffic to a hub airport for the purpose of evaluating the scheduling algorithms will be built.Finally, a sufficiently large number of randomly chosen traffic samples will be generated to obtain the statistical characteristics of the scheduling algorithm as a function of mix of aircraft and traffic density.The primary criterion of performance is average delay per aircraft.In addition, a few individual traffic samples will be examined to determine where scheduling algorithms may be simplified or improved.In reference 4, CPS always followed TA, because CPS had a much smaller effect on delay reduction.There are reasons to believe that CPS should be applied first, however, followed by TA.CPS increases the lengths of the gaps compared to FCFS.These longer gaps may sometimes be taken advantage of in the fuel saving TA algorithm.
Scheduling AlgorithmsIn order to sequence aircraft for landing at an airport in an efficient manner one has to know the spacing requirements for different types of aircraft.Therefore these requirements will be discussed before going to the actual scheduling algorithms.
Spacing RequirementsSpacing requirements are an essential input for all types of scheduling algorithms.As stated earlier, two types of aircraft are being dealt with, heavy and large.For each type, the FAA specifies a spacing distance at landing that is dependent on the sequence heavy-heavy, heavy-large, large-large, large-heavy.The minimum spacing matrix is shown below (spacing distances are in nautical miles).
Second to landFirst
Modified First-Come First-Served AlgorithmThe simple FCFS algorithm determines the aircraft landing sequence based on the order of the sequence of estimated times of arrival (ETAs) at the runway, computed by the Center at the time the aircraft cross the Center's boundary.1 shows data for a specific large aircraft.Heavy aircraft use about twice the amount of fuel, even if that fact was taken into consideration, heavy aircraftwould not be sequenced preferentially, since for TA the FCFS order remains preserved.Only the magnitude of ta may be changed, which then would favor heavy aircraft since the total fuel tends to be minimized.Also, Table 1 shows that the fuel use of an aircraft depends on many other factors such as initial speed and altitude.Even if one could take these factors into account computationally, certain aircraft would get preferential treatment.To prevent favoring fuel savings for any aircraft, in this evaluation heavy and large aircraft were given the same performance function.There is another factor that suggests not to use overall fuel minimization for the fleet directly.The desired ETA calculated by the DA is not the point of minimum fuel use for a given flight path.In an example (not shown), fuel use was plotted versus ETA for a 250 n. mi.approach from 33,000 ft altitude to a landing at Denver while staying on the nominal horizontal flight path.Minimum fuel use was almost at the the slowest approach.In fact, compared to that for the nominal ETA, the fuel use was 80 lbs or 2.4% less at a cost of an additional flight time of 2 minutes.The nominal ETA has been chosen for several good reasons.The chosen ETA considers the cost of both fuel and time, and it also tends to center the achievable range of time control without having to go off the specified path.Therefore, a simplified cost model was used, which treats all aircraft equally, preserves the fact that TA is costly for the lead aircraft, and emphasizes the fact that it is desirable to achieve the nominal ETA whenever possible.For the estimate of cost for various amounts of ta, the following simplified model for the costs and savings was adopted where j denotes the jth aircraft in a sequence:1) calculate the STAj's without TA (first-come-firstserved)2) subtract desired ta from each STA to obtain the timeadvance STAs.
STA_TAj = STAj -taThis means that the sequence of aircraft an'd their spacings remain exactly as before, except for a time shift of ta minutes.3) calculate the delay after TA for each aircraft : delay j= STA_TAj -ET_ 4) when the delay is positive, the aircraft is still delayed in spite of the ta, but one assumes that the cost decreases proportional to the decrease of delay (ta) ' and the incremental cost is:  This is the incremental cost to minimize.From table 1, in the above calculations a unit of cost is about 100 lbs of fuel per minute, but can vary widely dependent on the initial conditions when entering the Center airspace.After initially time advancing each aircraft in a traffic sample, one removes or reduces all taS not required for maintaining the TA sequence of the next aircraft exactly as it was.This is illustrated in figure 1.When initially all aircraft are time-advanced, it may happen that some aircraft have negative delays (time-advance) with their inherent fuel costs, when the immediately following aircraft does not benefit.Therefore, as shown in figure 1  The average minimum costs versus ta for various demands were determined by running one thousand 1.5 hour length samples for a range of ta, 0 < ta < 2 minutes in steps of 0.1 minute using both parts of the algorithm and the average cost vs.ta was plotted in figure 2. This gives the result: low ta is best for low demand; high ta for high demand.The curves also show the relatively low sensitivity to choosing a less than minimum cost ta.This low sensitivity is mostly due to the second part of the fuel saving TA algorithm.So far the minimum cost average ta for the full capacity runway was determined.When the acceptance rate of the runway is reduced, delays build up more quickly with time, larger groups of sequenced aircraft will occur, and a larger ta will be effective in reducing delays and saving fuel.In other words ta is a function of both demand and acceptance rate.To find the proper ta when the acceptance rate is reduced is simply a matter of scaling; e. g. if the runway acceptance rate falls by a factor of 2 it is equivalent to the doubling of the demand.We can thereforewrite
Scheduling Algorithm for Two Dependent RunwaysWhen two runways are available for landing, a limited further chance for optimization occurs.Here only the most restrictive case is treated: Aircraft arriving from the left land on the left runway, and aircraft arriving from the fight land on the fight runway and no switches between runways will be permitted.As an example Kennedy airport has two runways that are separated by one mile.Therefore, the traffic from the left and the fight can be landed only semi independently.The following stagger rule applies: Aircraft landing on different runways must be separated by at least 2 n. mi.longitudinally on ftnal independent of aircraft type.This means that, independent of the algorithm used for scheduling, the spacing of aircraft on final to one runway must be the larger distance of the two "minimum spacing required between two aircraft on final, (see section on "spacing requirements")" and  otherwise specified, 30% of all traffic is heavy jets, 70% is large jets.Presently only two types of aircraft are dealt with, heavy and large.At Denver, small aircraft usually land on a different runway.These assumptions will sometimes be varied to observe the effects on the delay statistics.Actual route-traversal times within the Center boundary are shown in table 2. These times vary considerably and make it difficult to develop a sequence that remains fixed in time, one that a controller can use.Hence, the times for each route were approximately equalized (the "total" columns in the table), which is equivalent in a real system to extending the shorter routes, J170, J10, and J157 into the adjacent Centers.The total route-traversal times are not arbitrarily made equal, since in a real system routetraversal times vary as a function of aircraft types and winds, and the sequencer must be able to handle routes of various lengths.This simulation is limited to constant route-traversal times for each route, independent of the type of aircraft, thus avoiding the study of possible conflicts on the same route, when a faster aircraft may pass a slower one.To study the sensitivity of calculated delays as a function of the distribution of aircraft in the specified time-interval, the choice of a triangular distribution of aircraft for each jet route is also provided.
ResultsFirst, individual traffic samples will be discussed to give a clear picture of the generation of traffic samples and their statistical character, as well as to demonstrate the effect that scheduling has on delays.Second, statistical results will be discussed in terms of cumulative probability distributions.

Analysis of Traffic Including Both Modes of OptimizationIn interpreting the following data, one must remember that the model that is being used for traffic-sample generation assumes that there is a rectangular probability distribution For figures 13 to 18 the heuristic TA method was used.The trends shown would be similar for the improved TA method.Figure 13 shows the cumulative probability distributions for the average delay per aircraft in a given traffic sample, with the parameter N, the traffic density or demand in number of aircraft per hour.The traffic mix (traffic from NW and NE) and the aircraft mix (heavies vs large) have been chosen such that it should show the greatest benefit for CPS optimization, namely both 50%/50%.Figure 14 shows data similar to those in figure 13, but for the traffic and aircraft mix chosen for most of this simulation, which is described in the Traffic Model section.As an example, if one studies the N = 45 curves in figure 14, the benefits of TA and TA + CPS can be readily seen.For FCFS scheduling, an average delay of 8 min or less is realized for 46% of the traffic samples.With the addition of TA, the same average delay per aircraft or less is realized for 58% of all traffic samples.With the further addition of CPS, this delay, or less, occurs 64% of the time.In the remaining cumulative distribution figures, the groups of curves representing FCFS, FCFS + TA, and FCFS + TA + CPS are not always labeled separately, since they are always in the same order.By looking at the complete cumulative distribution curves, the TA curves are moved to the left of the FCFS curves by somewhat less than I min, as was expected, since that was the assumed maximum time-advance for each aircraft.In actual traffic, the allowable time-advance for a given aircraft depends on the type of aircraft, the aircraft state, and the proposed path.This may be somewhat more than 1 min on the average.In both figures 13.9 .9¢0 JO o .5 G) :> m ..8 .7 >, .6 J_--I E o .3 .2 .14and 14, comparing the reduction of the average time-delay when CPS is added, one notices that CPS is more effective for greater traffic densities, which is fortunate.This is so, because longer groups occur in heavy traffic, and long groups can be optimized more effectively than short ones.However, compared with TA, the benefit of CPS is relatively small.Even in the best case, the delay reduction is less than 0.5 min per aircraft.In this simulation, CPS was calculated only once for each traffic sample by dividing it into groups of aircraft and applying CPS to each separate group.In an actual system, the STA calculations would have to be started for each aircraft as it arrives at the Center boundary and finished as it passes the freeze horizon.Since the present CPS algorithm is an example of the dynamic programming principle, the algorithm determines the final sequence only after the last aircraft of each group has passed the Ceffter boundary.Making earlier decisions on position switching will cause some loss in performance.In figure 15 data from figures 13 and 14 are combined to compare different aircraft mixes for the same arrival rates.The larger number of heavies in the 50% heavy/50% large aircraft mix curves require more spacing and therefore have more delay.However, CPS is more effective in this j... i.
:':' :.-': :;,t 0.   For the large window sizes and a 0.5 traffic mix, the heuristic CPS even performs slightly better than the optimal single-position-shift CPS.This happens because it checks for two extra patterns, which shift one heavy aircraft either forward or backward by two spaces, and because those patterns are more frequent for the 50/50 traffic mix.So far all cumulative probability curves shown were for 1.5-hr samples.Figure 17 gives the reduction of average delay when the length of the traffic sample is reduced.In figure 17, where the same parameters were used as in figure 13 for 40 aircraft/hr, one can see that the reduction in sample time interval by a factor of 3 reduced the average delay by a factor of more than 2.However, one notices that the benefit of CPS for short samples is much smaller.The effect of longer and shorter sample timeintervals on delays will be investigated later in more detail for FCFS only.Figure 18 shows the effect of specifying a freeze horizon above the minimum flight time from the Center boundary to landing, in an effort to make a frozen sequence available early to the air traffic controllers.The FCFS As can be seen, there is a relatively high cost involved in scheduling new arrivals around already frozen aircraft slots.For the high-density traffic, the cost is almost as high as the gain from TA, and it is somewhat smaller for the lower-rate traffic (demand of 30 aircraft/hr).Now, results for the realizable fuel saving TA algorithm will be given followed by the heuristic CPS algorithm and visa versa.First, the cumulative probability plots of delays will be shown (see fig. 19).Here the average minimum cost taS in minutes that have been used for the different traffic demands are shown.Since the curves for the minimum cost ta include the effects of reducing unnecessary time-advances, the minimum cost ta curves are not moved to the left by ta but show a reduction.This is especially noted for lower demands, where more unnecessary taS are reduced or removed.As stated before, a better measure of performance is the can determine the limits of the acceptance rates.For the case of 50% heavy and 50% large aircraft and only minimum gaps in the sequence, the worst case is a runway acceptance rate of 36 aircraft per hour when aircraft types are exactly alternating, and in the best case 40 aircraft per hour when they are separately grouped.This means that, when the demand exceeds the runway acceptance rate, delays must build up linearly after a transient.When the pool of delayed aircraft is large, it becomes less likely that sequence gaps exist.In that case CPS packs the aircraft more tightly than their FCFS order, and throughput increases.At the smaller demand, TA seems to contribute to the acceptance rate, at least for the early part of the sample.This is probably due to the fact that the TA algorithm spreads out the traffic more evenly when the second part of the algorithm removes the unproductive timeadvances for certain aircraft.At large delays for high demands, this process is essentially inactive.But CPS now finds long Voups which benefit from position switching.Therefore, for a demand of 45 aircraft per hour, there is an increase in landing rate of 0.75 aircraft per hour, which is an increase of 2%.Finally, the heuristic TA results will be compared with the fuel saving TA algorithm.In addition the fuel saving TA algorithm, which can be implemented will be compared with the algorithm which minimizes the performance function for each particular sample but which cannot be implemented.In figure 22
Average delay per aircraft [minutes]Cumulative distribution for average delays in traffic samples for different demands.over FCFS is for the old TA system with 1 minute ta (curve 1).This is the system, in which an aircraft is timeadvanced only if at least the next aircraft benefits.For the old system this performance is improved somewhat if a larger t a is chosen, which, in this case, was the ta appropriate for the improved TA algorithm (curve 2).If, in addition, the t a is removed or reduced when the following aircraft do not benefit, as shown in figure 1, an additional improvement for the old system is obtained (curve 3).This case was tested to explore the possibility of an add-on to the present scheduling implementation.The improved TA algorithm outperforms the original algorithm by a significant margin (curve 4).Finally, the performance of the non-realizable algorithm is shown, which would require the availability of the complete data sample.Here the ta to minimize the performance index for each particular 1 1/2 hour data sample was chosen (curve 5).The difference between curves 4 and 5 is the  ., ,,:, ._:...:.:: / ,:;:.,.:.: .,.."/ I : ,/ : ..,,:,:.: ..; :",":', :_ j .,::-:/ ,,,,."_.;...'" ,.,'_,,r
Results for Scheduling for Two Dependent RunwaysThe result of the one step optimization for staggered approaches on 2 dependent runways is exactly the same whether one takes the two separately computed streams of ETAs or the STAs computed for independent runways without CPS.This is so, since the algorithm depends only on the order of these sequences, and the order remains exactly the same.This method results in an ordering which involves largely alternating aircraft landing between runways, especially, when both have the same demand (fig.27(a)).This method has a distinct advantage over the method where the ordering is based either on the order of the merged ETAs alone, or the order of the independent STAs (fig.27(b)) alone, although the latter method is better than the first.(See fig.28 for summary results).We can now remove all terms that are independent of the order of the e's and we need to maximize e 0 < e 1 < e 2 < .......... < e n Therefore, the larger the term ej the larger is the factor that it is multiplied with.By inspection, any change in the order of the i's from the FCFS order will reduce the value of the expression.Hence, the'FCFS schedule minimizes the standard deviation of the delays when all aircraft are to be spaced equidistant from each other.Exploring sequences with a mix of aircraft is of little value, since this has already been done to reduce the mean delay.This paper presents an algorithm for finding an optimal solution to the CPS problem for a single position shift.This method has been developed by J. C. Jackson, who was at Ames Research Center in 1989.
The Algorithm "Finding the optimal ordering of a set of aircraft can be thought of as a search for the least "cost" path through a tree of possible aircraft orderings, where the cost is the sum of the time separations required between each pair of aircraft.For the CPS problem, an initial ordering of aircraft is given, along with a list of delays from the ETA and the maximum possible time-advance for each aircraft.In the final ordering each aircraft is constrained to lie within one position of its initial position, and no aircraft must have a time of arrival earlier than permitted by the maximum allowable time-advance.Thus only six values (three for the current level of the tree and three for the previous) must be stored by the program to compute the value of the optimal path.This process of extending least cost paths eventually terminates when each path has N (the number of aircraft) aircraft along it.For the MPS = 1 case, only the last two aircraft in the initial list are candidates for being last in the optimal ordering.Thus the least cost paths leading to these aircraft at the lowest level of the tree are compared and the smaller cost path is chosen as the final optimal path.For example, assume that the spacing times required for various pairs of five aircraft are as given in table B-1.An additional detail of the algorithm which has so far been neglected is the maintenance of the list of best paths to each node of the search tree.This can be handled in a number of ways; a particularly simple way for the MPS --1 case is to simply maintain three vectors which represent the best path thus far to the leftmost, middle, and rightmost nodes of the tree.For example, when A-C-B is chosen as the best path to D at level four in the example above, this path (the leftmost path at level three) can be copied to the vector for the middle path (position of D at level four) and D earl be appended.Of course, care must be taken not to overwrite a vector representing a path at the previous level before that level has been completely processed, so two sets of three vectors (one for current level and one for previous) can be used.Abbreviationsand Def'mitions AAR Airport Acceptance Rate ARTCC Air Route Traffic Control Center (also called Center) ASP Arrival Sequencing Program (new operational version of the Center traffic management system (1991)) ATC Air Traffic Control CPS constrained position-shift optimization scheduling method CTAS Center TRACON Automation System DA descent advisor calculates ETAs ERM en route metering (previous operational version of the Center traffic management system (before 1991)) ETA estimated time of arrival at the runway (no interference from other aircraft) FAA Federal Aviation Administration
44The time separations are based on FAA specified spacing distances on final approach, and on the speed profile of each aircraft weight class (ref.7).The time separations for no wind are shown below (times in seconds).These time separations include pads for navigation and piloting errors as well as other uncertainties.conditions, when the trailing aircraft flies at constant airspeed independent of the wind, its ground speed is reduced by the speed of the wind.Thus for a specific spacing in miles, under headwind conditions, the time-separation matrix will have larger required separations.When the headwind is 20 knots, the following approximate values are obtained.(The exact values depend on the assumed indicated airspeed profile).Again, the time separations are given in seconds.separations are those used in the present report for analytical purposes.In CrAS, situational dependent time separations to meet the minimum separation standards are computed for.individualaircraft pairs via fast time integration.
Time for nominal speedprofile = tn.Total fuel for nominal speed profile = fn.Time for fast profile = tf.Total fuel for fast profile = ff.Acost = -t a This is reasonable, since one assumes that, at least for the larger FCFS delays, the reduced delay saves fuel by reduced path stretching in cruise, and, of course, it saves time proportional to ta. 5) when the delay after TA is negative, delay < 0 the aircraft is asked to arrive before its nominal ETA.Unless there was no delay in the FCFS sequence the ta will first bring the original delay to zero with a savings in cost for the jth aircraft Acostm = -( STAj-ETAj) Then the remaining time-advance called "actual ta," incurs a positive cost, called cost2.When the actual timeadvance is equal or less than one minute, one assumes that the additional fuel cost is of similar magnitude as the fuel saved for reducing the cruise time by the same amount.But, above one minute actual ta, fuel consumption rises sharply.Because of the absence in this simulation of a DA to compute a maximum available ta, for this analysis a maximum amount of allowable actual ta of 2 minutes was assumed to account for the maximum speed capability of the aircraft and to provide a reserve for control.Then Acost2 = --delay; where 0 < -delay < 1 minute; Acost2 = delay * delay; where 1 < --delay < 2 minutes; In other words 2 minutes of negative delay costs four times as much as 1 minute of negative delay.The total change of cost compared to FCFS for time advancing one aircraft then is Acost = Acostl + Acost2 6) The total cost change from FCFS for an air traffic sample is the sum of the incremental costs for all aircraft Atotal_cost = 2_ Acostj;

"Figure 3 .3figures that the incoming traffic was heavily concentrated in the 30-min period from 7:45 A.M. to 8:15 A.M. (local time), and that almost all traffic was from the NE and SE.In fact, there were 56 aircraft scheduled in a 33-min time interval.Such peaks are somewhat flattened out by the natural statistical blurring owing to random delays in takeoffs, errors caused by winds, and flight technical factors.The flattening process is further aided by deliberate changes, such as ground holding and increases in in-trail spacing.To get a more precise model of the traffic, one would have to collect data for many days on aircraft crossing the Center boundary, along with aircraft type and planned route.Such data are difficult to obtain.Therefore, a somewhat less detailed model is used, which is based on gross traffic statistics.Traffic Model for Studying Scheduler Effects The purpose of this work is to describe a statistically accurate traffic model typical of peak hours at Denver, which was used to investigate different scheduling algorithms.When many traffic samples are analyzed, the

the chosen statistical traffic parameters, such as the landing rate and the sample time-interval, the start times and routes for exactly M aircraft are generated uniformly for the time-interval specified, where M = (landing rate * time interval ), and is rounded to an integer.The aircraft arrival rate for each route is chosen based on the traffic load at Denver.Since time en route varies between 42.3 and 47.78 min for different routes, the nominal landing times have been rearranged so that the rectangular distribution of ETAs for each route centers on one-half of the time-interval specified.This results in an overall nonuniform distribution for start times [ETA -Route_traversal_time], where only the first and last few minutes are affected.The uniform distributions of start times for individual routes sometimes violate the minimum spacing standard of 3 rain on each route.(For the newer results with the fuel saving TA algorithm, the minimum spacing is reduced to 2 rain, which is thought to he more realistic).Hence, the times at which the aircraft cross the original Center boundary for each route are modified iteratively, starting from the earliest aircraft, by shifting each aircraft that violates the specified minimum in-trail spacing time-interval to a later time until all air-craft meet the specified in-trail spacing.This often generates several equally spaced aircraft, especially in heavy traffic, which duplicates real traffic situations.Also, this modification sometimes makes the traffic sample longer than the specified interval, especially when large in-trail spacing time-intervals are specified.Again, this is thought to be realistic, since a scheduling time-interval for a fixed number of aircraft must get stretched out, as the example in figures 3 and 4 showed.
tabular form are hard to grasp, a graphical presentation has been developed.The graphical presentation of the sample affords a quick way of understanding the interrelations of the various timeordered lists and of grasping causes of delays, as well as suggesting some remedies.Using an example, first the time diagram will be described in detail and then various traffic samples will be presented, limiting the discussion to major points.Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show a theoretical traffic sample at Denver (arrival rate of 25 aircraft/hr from the NE and NW).Given a set of parameters, such as arrival rate (demand), sample time-interval, percent of total traffic on each route, minimum in-trail spacing, and freeze horizon, each random-number generator seed defines one traffic sample.Knowing this seed, one can examine in detail unusual traffic sequences detected during the statistical runs.In all the traffic samples shown, two thirds of the traffic is through Drako and one third through Keann.The mix of large-to-heavy aircraft is 70% to 30%.The traffic sample time-intervals are 1.5 hr, with no traffic before or after.The minimum in-trail spacing in the Center is 3 min, which often results in several aircraft on a route exactly 3 min apart.

Figure 1616Figure 16(b) shows similar data for the heuristic CPS as compared with the optimal.As can be seen, the heuristic CPS has only a minor loss in performance compared to the optimal.The effectiveness of the heuristic CPS depends on the size of the scheduling window.As shown in table 3 and in the inset in figure 16(b), the larger the window, the closer the performance of the heuristic CPS approximates that of the optimal single-position-switch CPS.The mean values shown as dots on the inset of figure 16(b) are above the 0.5 cumulative probability point, since the tails of the
cost discussed earlier.Cumulative probability curves for fuel cost are shown in figure 20.Due to the scaling chosen for the cost, the curves for FCFS delays that were shown in figure 19 and those for FCFS costs are identical.For demands of 35 and 45 aircraft per hour, figure 20 also shows the results for reversing the order of the optimization algorithms.Indeed statistically, CPS followed by TA is slightly better than TA followed by CPS, although the reverse is true for about one-third of the individual sampies.Unless this change is accomplished easily in the system of reference 1, it may not be worth implementing.Schedule optimization reduces fuel used in the terminal area and it reduces delays.It increases runway acceptance only indirectly.To show this, demands are chosen which are above runway capacity.The average landing rates for 10,000 samples plotted against time are shown in figure 21.By postulating two extreme traffic samples one
small cost one has to pay for a 15 minute windowing of the data for the realizable TA algorithm.A comparison can be made between the proposed algorithm and the British work presented in references 2 and 3.They propose TA "on" for heavy traffic and "off" for light traffic.This is the proper thing to do; the problem is to decide when the switch is to occur.The same problem occurred with the algorithm presently implemented in the Traffic Manager Station in the NASA Ames simulation, reference 1.The variable ta with demand, and especially the second part of the fuel saving algorithm avoids this problem.Further Traffic Analysis FCFS Only In the preceding Results subsection it was shown what optimal scheduling can accomplish under various conditions by presenting complete cumulative distributions.Various other effects owing to change in the traffic model or environment will next be briefly treated by discussing the effect on the 50% frequency point of the cumulative distributions.That is, 50% of the samples have higher average delay.Because of the asymmetry of the distribution, the expected value is somewhat higher.This will be reported on FCFS with low horizon only, since the effects of optimization have been pretty well demonstrated in the last section.Delay as function of length of traffic samples-An individual traffic sample can be thought of as a segment of traffic in which traffic before and after the sample is very light.Figure 23 shows that for relatively brief !..... ._::'_'-.-.:'..':., :,,;.."--_.7/..--.:.';."._,_-"_'_'"'_, _-" "-:"...'i;;:,_',,,> "",",;,"'.2"-•:,_ _" "_%,-'.':-_._."_._::" _-_""

that various separations be maintained between landing aircraft based on their weights, and generally the lighter the aircraft the greater the spacing required.Clearly, then, the amount of time required to land a given set of aircraft can depend on the landing order.One approach to finding an "optimal" landing order is the Constrained Position Shift (CPS) concept of Roger Dear.Heposited that, given an initial arrival ordering, realworld constraints would preclude moving any of the aircraft more than some small number of positions from its original place in the arrival list.However, he did not present an exact solution to the CPS problem; his method was to examine a window of 2*MPS-1 positions, optimize it (exhaustively) for a single position shift, move the window down one position, and repeat the process.A later effort (Luenberger) improves on the performance of the Dear algorithm but still fails to consistently achieve optimal performance.

Tracing through the tree of figure B-1 (and ignoring the now undefined aircraft F) we find that there are two paths to aircraft D at level four, A-B-C-D and A-C-B-D, and that their respective costs are eight and six.Thus A-C-B-D is chosen as the preferred path to this node.Likewise, A-B-C-E is the low cost path (seven) to E at this level and A-B-D-C is the only path (cost 10) to C at this level.Extending these three paths to the fifth and final level, we find that A-C-B-D-E (cost 10) is better than A-B-D-C-E (cost 12), but A-B-C-E-D is preferable to both of these (cost nine).This final path is therefore chosen as the overall optimal path.
of other aircraft subsequently entering into the scheduling interval. The scheduling algorithm receives the data for each new aircraft as it passes the initial spatial scheduling horizon: present time at which the aircraft crosses the initial sequencing horizon, ETA, aircraft weight class, and air- craft identification. If the (temporal) freeze horizon is a shorter time interval than the shortest estimated flight time from the Center boundary to landing, the scheduling algo- rithm establishes the landing sequence in order of the computed ETA, which is called the FCFS order, andcomputes the associated sequenced time of arrival (STA)at the runway. If the freeze horizon is a larger time inter-val than the shortest estimated flight time from the Centerboundary to landing, the situation is more complicated, aswill be discussed next.For aircraft that enter the scheduling horizon, the STAsare computed as follows. If no other previously sequencedaircraft's ETA is later than that of the newcomer'sETA,then the STAs of the earlier sequenced aircraft are notdisturbed, and the newcomer is assigned h time equal toits ETA or the time that ensures the minimum time-separation required for the types of aircraft that arefollowing each other, whichever is larger. If a newarrival's ETA falls ahead of the time slots reserved forpreviously sequenced aircraft, and if none of the alreadysequenced aircraft had its sequence frozen, then the newarrival is inserted ahead of these aircraft in the order ofthe ETA and at the proper spacing from the next earlieraircraft. All aircraft following the new arrival are respaeedwith the proper time separation. If frozen sequenced air-craft have STAs later than the new arrival's ETA, it isfirst checked if a sufficiently large gap exists such that thenew aircraft can be sequenced ahead of the frozen aircraftwithout changing any other aircraft's position. If properspacing cannot be maintained, the new aircraft issequenced in front of the first aircraft whose schedule hasnot yet been frozen, and the non-frozen aircraft behind theThe modified FCFS algorithm recognizes two schedulinghorizons: an initial scheduling horizon and a finalscheduling horizon. The initial scheduling horizon is aspatial horizon, which is the position at which each air-craft enters the Center's space. The final scheduling hori-zon, called the freeze horizon is defined by a specifictime-to-landing(ETA), given no interference from otheraircraft.Once an aircraft has penetrated the freeze horizon, its STA remains unchanged, independent of ETAs
newcomer are rescheduled. (If frozen aircraft are present,this is not strictly an FCFS scheduling, even though it iscalled that in this report.)Aircraft arriving at the boundary of the schedulinghorizon appear unevenly spaced. Therefore the FCFSalgorithm creates groups of tightly sequenced aircraft withlarger gaps between individual groups. With the FCFSalgorithm, the first aircraft in a group requires no delaywhereas succeeding aircraft, on the average, requireincreasinglylarger delays.
Time-Advance Heuristic time-advance algorithm- The TA method, called the negative delay effect in reference 2, operates on the first aircraft of each group, and does not changetheexisting order (e.g., FCFS). The first aircraft in a group isspeeded up to arrive sooner than its nominal ETA, and allaircraft in the group following it will have their delaysdecreased by the same amount of time. This also reducesor closes the initial intergroup gap. Since speedup is
costly, the first aircraft is speeded up only when at leastthe immediately following aircraft requires a delay, whichis shortened because of the speedup of the first aircraft. Inthis statistical evaluation, there exists no program thatcalculates maximum, minimum, and nominal ETAs fromaircraft, navigation, and weather data. In the absence ofactual minimum ETA data, a maximum time-advanceof1 min is chosen for all aircraft. In the implementedscheduling system of CTAS, the time-advance for eachleading aircraft in a group is based on a fraction of thecalculated values of the available time-advance.When the (temporal) freeze horizon has a smaller valuethan the time of the shortest flightpath, FCFS and TAapplied to the incoming traffic result in the same overallaircraft order.
The fuel saving TA algorithm using a performance function-Although, the following algorithm is called fuel saving TA, fuel saving is only one of the objectives of the algorithm. Whenever possible, it also attempts to preserve the desired ETAs, which the DA specifies, and it attempts to reduce mean delays compared to FCFS scheduling while keeping the standard deviation to a minimum. Time-advance is performed in two steps. First, all aircraft are time-advanced from their FCFS time by an equal amount regardless of future benefit. Second, since time- advance is costly, all time-advances that are not required to improve the following traffic are removed or reduced. The idealized fuel saving TA algorithm: Before discussing the realizable fuel saving TA algorithm, one pretends to have the complete traffic sample available. Later the realizable case is examined, where traffic data are available only in the scheduling window. This permits the study of performance loss due to a finite scheduling window. To answer the question how much time-advance to use as a function of the demand, one must model the cost. First, fuel use was considered as cost only, withoutadding savings due to flight time reduction, but this didnot prove practical. Table 1 shows some examples of fuelexpendituresand times for nominal and fast incomingflightsfrom250 n. mi. out. The TA capability is larger foraircraft that enter the Center airspace at slow speed, sincethey can speed up briefly before descent.Also, for higher entry speed the fuel cost per minute
time-advance increases. The fast rise in fuel expenditure if ta is furtherincreased is not seen on this chart, since the presentDescent Advisor (DA) sets conservative maximum speedlimits. Table

Closely spaced parallel runway operation.•Conclusions
Scheduling was performed in a three-step sequence: one initial ordering FCFS, and two optimization steps, TA and CPS, where CPS is computationally more complicatedthan TA. Unfortunately,the incremental reduction of theaverage delay time per aircraft is less for CPS than forTA, but CPS results in a small increase in runwaycapacitywhile TA does not.The heuristic TA method can at best reduce the delay ofeach sequenced aircraft by the same amount that the firstaircraft in each group has been time-advanced,which was1 min in this report and can be somewhat more inpractice. Although the left shift of the cumulative distri-bution curve owing to TA is almost independent of thetraffic density, TA for light traffic is more costly for theairlines.This is because more leading aircraft of smaller groups must be time-advanced, which is unnecessary since delays are already small.It has been shown that the two step

Hence, thedata given are meant to show trends rather than to givehard values.For each landing rate and using the present model oftraffic, large deviations from the mean delay occur as afunction of the randomnessof grouping of the traffic.Although the average delay in the Center airspace can bereduced by reducing the traffic density into the Center byalgorithm. It has also been shown that proper choice of taas a function of demand together with the post processingof the resulting sequence with the second part of the newTA algorithm (fig. 1) results in fuel savings even for theheuristic TA system. However, the best result is obtainedwhen all aircraft in the scheduling window are first timeshifted by the proper amount (such a mode is available inthe present system), and if then, for the intermediatedemands, the algorithm of figure 1 is applied for all butthe last aircraft in the window starting with the next to lastone. Overall, this will result in a simplificationof thescheduling system and it will reduce the traffic manager'sworkload, by removing his choice of how many aircraftmust benefit for time-advance to occur. It will only addslight computationalcomplexity, namely table lookup forthe correct ta, given the estimated demand and runway acceptance rate, and the implementation of the iterative algorithm of.figure 1.In this report it was impossible to I treat thedegradation of performance that will result when all aircraft do not have the same TA capability.For tions.Because of the randomness of the traffic, gaps will remain in the sequenced sequence of aircraft.The first gap is filled, or partially filled, by TA while preserving the FCFS order.Tightly sequenced groups of aircraft remain with a mix of heavy and large aircraft.Spacing requirements differ for different types of aircraft trailing each other.CPS takes advantage of this fact through mild reordering of the traffic, to shorten the groups, thus reducing the average delays.Actual delays for different samples with the same statistical parameters vary widely, especially for heavy traffic.Both methods of improving the schedule, TA and CPS, work best for heavy traffic.

AGENCY USE ONLY (Leave blank) 2. REPORT DATE S. REPORT TYPE AND DATES COVEREDOctober 1991 Technical Memorandum The air traffic control subsystem that performs sequencing and spacing is discussed.The function of the sequencing and spacing algorithms is to automatically plan the most efficient landing order and to assign optimally spaced landing times to all arrivals.Several algorithms are described and their statistical performance is examined.Sequencing brings order to an arrival sequence for aircraft.First-come-f'n'st-served sequencing (FCFS) establishes a fair order, based on estimated times of arrival, and determines proper separations.Because of the randomness of the arriving traffic, gaps will remain in the sequence of aircraft.Delays are reduced by time-advancing the leading aircraft of each group while still preserving the FCFS order.Tightly spaced groups of aircraft remain with a mix of heavy and large aircraft.Spacing requirements differ for different types of aircraft trailing each other.Traffic is reordered slightly to take advantage of this spacing criterion, thus shortening the groups and reducing average delays.For heavy traffic, delays for different traffic samples vary widely, even when the same set of statistical parameters is used to produce each sample.This report supersedes NASA TM-102795 on the same subject.It includes a new method of time-advance as well as an efficient method of sequencing and spacing for two dependent runways.
