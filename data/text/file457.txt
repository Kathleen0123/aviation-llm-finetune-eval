Efforts have been developed to establish motion cueing fidelity criteria.Sinacori' proposed a Motion Fidelity Scale (MFS), which correlated pilot opinion with the motion platform magnitude attenuation and phase distortion.His results were based on a slalom maneuver with a top speed of 60 knots, banking turns up to f 60 degrees and normal load factors to' 2 g's, and a precision hover.Jex3 presented a subjective correlation to the motion magnitude attenuation and phase distortion based on a 15 degrees bank-and-stop fighter maneuver with a fully coordinated aircraft.He developed a criterion on the sway motion necessary to keep the spurious side force cues (from the rolling motion) small enough to prevent pilot objections.Schroeder4 subsequently investigated the motion gain dependency of the sway motion relative-to the rol1 motion with no washout filter applied.Chung' then combined the previous criteria which tied the roll and lateral motion washout filter characteristics together as shown in Figure 1.This study was developed to further confirm the Figure 1 criterion by examining the motion filter conditions more thoroughly, with additional pilots and tasks.Experiment Description
Aircraft ModelsTwo aircraft, a helicopter and a fixed-wing jet, were developed from a generic, two degree-of-freedom model.This input was effectively roll rate command and the lateral response was fully coordinated as given by equation 1, primary differences between this task and the helicopter task was the fighter-like stick force gradient and the substantially different visual cues.
Test FacilitiesThe roll and lateral motion axes of the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS), Figure 4, provided f 18 degrees of bank and 40 ft of lateral travel.The motion and visual responses were measured using the frequency response identification technique called CIFERe7 along with an Image Dynamic Measurement System (IDMS)'. Figure 5 illustrates the visual measurement setup.A Gaussian white noise input was fed into the control input and the visual and motion responses were recorded for analysis.The helicopter model's roll rate response, visual response, and platform motion responses are shown in Figure 6.The visual response approximates a 60 msec pure time delay over that of the math model.The VMS's roll motion response and lateral motion response are shown in Figure 7, which shows a well matched motion system response, as recommendedg.The model values and cockpit stick characteristics are shown in Table 1.The control power was chosen so that both aircraft would have the same steady state roll rate per stick force input.The rotational center for both model was chosen at the pilot's abdomen.The objective to use two different force characteristics is to determine if there are any differences in Test Configuration and Procedures motion fidelity requirements between rotary wing tasks with a lighter stick force gradient at 1 lb/in and fixed wing tasksThe motion drive algorithm was comprised of two with a heavier stick force gradient at 2 lb/in.conventional second order high-pass washout filters, as shown in Figure 8.Both had damping ratios, &, and 6, of Task-HeliconterThe helicopter tasks was a 20-ft lateral translation performed at a constant altitude of 25 ft as shown in Figure 2. Pilots had clear dimensional information from evenly spaced windows and ground texture.The task started in a hover and then translated 20-ft to the right, followed by 20 seconds of hover station keeping in a medium level of sumof-sines disturbance, Table 2.This disturbance was summed directly with the pilot's control input.The desired time to complete the lateral translation was 7 seconds.The adequate completion time was 11 seconds.The desired station keeping position error was f 2 ft, which matched the visual scene window width for easy identification.The adequate position error was 4 5 ft.
Task-Fixed-wing JetThe fixed-wing jet used the scene shown in Figure 3.At a cruising speed of 250 Knots and an altitude of 1000 ft, the pilot was instructed to translate from the left drop tank of the leading aircraft to the drop tank at the right.In contrast with the helicopter task, pilots had a good horizon cueing reference but with less dimensional information.The same transition time performance criteria as well as the position error criteria was used as with the helicopter task.The aircraft was positioned at the same distance from the leading aircraft as the helicopter was positioned in front of the building.Note that the model did not allow a heading change, which would be small in this maneuver.The  9, with varying roll filter frequencies, wy were selected to represent low, medium, and high motion fidelity as predicted and defined in Reference 5. Six lateral washout filters with variations in magnitude, Krat, and phase distortion, o,,, as shown in Figure 9, were also developed to span medium and high fidelity according to Reference 5.The low-fidelity translational motion region was not tested due to the fact that both References 3 and 4 have adequately validated that region to be unacceptable.The gain and washout filter frequencies used for all roll and lateral configurations are shown in Tables 3 and4.All combinations of Table 3 andTable 4 were tested.Test configurations were randomly ordered and pilots flew each configuration at least three times before giving their ratings.Annunciators inside the cockpit were used to inform pilots of their tasks performance for both the translational time and station-keeping position error.Five experienced pilots, which included two Navy Test Pilot School instructors, two NASA test pilots, and one retired NASA test pilot, participated in this investigation.Pilots were asked to give handling qualities ratings (HQRs)" and motion fidelity scale (MFS) ratings as shown in Table 5.
ResultsTest data were analyzed according to the roll motion configurations as shown in Table 3, and in Figure 9.The first group, Al, was analyzed for full roll motion (Al), i.e., the simulator bank angle followed the helicopter bank angle without any magnitude attenuation and phase distortion.For this condition, the variables were: lateral gain (Kr) and lateral phase distortion by changing the washout filter frequency (op).The second group, was analyzed for the attenuated roll motion with magnitude gain of 0.6 and three levels of phase distortion, i.e., phase distortion at 1 rad/sec of 20 degrees, 43 degrees, and 80 degrees, or test points A2, A3, and A4 from Figure 9 respectively.For this roll motion gain, the vaiables were roll motion phase distortion, (by changing op), lateral motion phase distortion (by changing co,), and lateral motion gain (K,,J.The observed levels of significance (p-values) were determined for these two groups of data, as shown in Table 6.A p-value is the probability of being incorrect in stating that an experimental factor (such as translational phase distortion) is causing the variation of the data (such as the handling qualities rating) rather than the variation being due to random effects.Typically, when the p-value is less than 0.05 (5 chances in 100 of making an error), the results are deemed statistically significant.Heliconter -Full roll motion (Al):The results from Table 6 show there is a significant effect due to the lateral motion gain on the average MFS (p=O.O37) and HQR (p=O.O42).The average MFS degraded from 1.7 to 1.3, and HQR degraded from 5.2 to 5.6 as the lateral motion gain (K,,J was reduced from 0.8 to 0.5.The data also show there is a significant effect due to the combination of the lateral motion gain and lateral washout filter frequency (lateral phase distortion) on the average MFS (p=O.O04) and HQR (p=O.O23).Figure 10 shows the average motion fidelity scale rating degraded as the lateral washout filter frequency (o,), increased from 0.25 to 0.9 with the interaction from the lateral motion gain.The results suggest when the roll motion cues match the visual cues, there is a benefit to minimize the lateral phase distortion and use as much lateral motion gain to mitigate the leans due to the roll motion.However, when lateral phase distortion is high (0,20.5),little benefit is gained with using larger lateral motion gain.This is consistent with the Reference 5 findings.Heliconter -Attenuated roll motion (A2.A3.A4):There were significant motion fidelity dependencies found due to the roll motion phase distortion (p=O.O26), and the lateral motion phase distortion (p=O.O22).Figure 11 shows the averaged MFS degraded as the roll motion phase distortion (op) increased.Figure 12 shows the averaged motion fidelity scales degraded as the lateral washout filter frequency (w,) increased from 0.25 to 0.9.(c)l999 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics or published with permission of author(s) and/or author(s)' sponsoring organization.From Table 6, the handling qualities was found to be affected by the lateral motion phase distortion (p=O.O22) only.Figure 12 shows the average HQR degraded *as the lateral washout filter frequency increased from 0.25 to 0.9.There is also a marginal motion fidelity dependency (O.l>p>O.O5) found due to the lateral motion gain (p=O.O72) and the combination of the roll phase distortion and the lateral gain (p=O.O91).As shown in Figure 13, the average motion fidelity scales improved when the roll motion phase distortion is relatively small (0,=0.25 and 0.5) when Kr, =0.8.However, for the largest roll phase distortion (e&,=0.9), the larger lateral motion gain had a negative effect on the motion fidelity.The rationale may lie in the distorted roll motion cues were simply reinforced by the erroneous side force cues.The results suggest that motion fidelity is dependent on the roll motion phase distortion, the lateral motion phase distortion, and the lateral motion gain.The results-suggest there is a benefit to keep both the roll motion phase distortion and the lateral motion phase distortion as low as possible, and provide as much lateralmotion gain as possible when low phase distortions are applied.This is consistent with Reference 5 findings.By defining high motion fidelity as the mean-MFS22.5, medium motion fidelity as the mean-MFS between 2.5 and 1.5, and the low motion fidelity as the mean-MFS less than 1.5, the average MFS from the helicopter task are compared with the criteria proposed in Reference 5 as shown in Figure 14.The results show good match in the expected high and medium motion fidelity regions.In the expected low motion fidelity region, only 4 out of 10 test outcomes match the predicted fidelity.For those unmatched low motion fidelity cases, the trend of degradation and the average MFS are still leaning toward the low motion fidelity.
Fixed-WingDue to limited time available, only three roll motion configurations and four lateral motion configurations were evaluated.The three roll motion configurations were Al, A2, and A3; and the four lateral motion configurations were Tl, T4, T5, and T6 as shown in Figure 9.
Fixed Wing -Full roll motion (Al):The average motion fidelity degraded as the lateral motion gain decreased from 0.8 to 0.5 as shown in Figure 15.The average motion fidelity degraded as the lateral phase distortion increased as shown in Figure 16.These results are consistent with the helicopter task.The average HQR shows the same consistency as shown in the average HQR graphs in Figure 15  Both the averaged MFS and HQR degraded as the roll motion phase distortion increased as shown in Figure 17.Both the averaged MFS and HQR also degraded as the lateral motion phase distortion increases.Figure 18 shows the MFS and HQR degrading as the lateral washout frequency (o,) increased which is also consistent with the helicopter task results..In general, results from this evaluation are quite consistent with the helicopter hover task.This is significant in establishing that even with different control power settings (0.67 vs. 1.33 rad/sec2/in.),different stick force gradients (1.0 vs. 2.0 lb/in.)and different tasks and visuals scenes the results were consistent.Conclusions 1) When using roll and lateral motion filters in a coordinated task, the roll phase distortion, lateral phase distortion, and lateral gain were shown to have effects to the motion fidelity.The findings suggest there is a benefit to keep the phase distortion, i.e., the washout filter frequency, of both washout filters small to improve the motion fidelity.In addition, the findings show there is a benefit to keep the lateral gain large when the phase distortion is small to improve the motion fidelity 2).The findings support the fidelity criteria proposed in Reference 5.(c)l999 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics or published with permission of author(s) and/or author(s)' sponsoring organization.0.7.A roll washout filter generated the roll motion commands, and a lateral washout filter provided the lateral motion to mitigate the leans due to the roll motion.Four roll washout filter characteristics, Figure
