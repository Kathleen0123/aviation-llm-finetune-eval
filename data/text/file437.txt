INTRODUCTIONFor many years the simulation community has used the military specification turbulence filters described in reference 1 in applications involving conventional aircraft models.For rotorcraft models, however, these filters present an unusual challenge.In particular, for sophisticated blade-element models such as the Black Hawk (UH-60) model of reference 2, the challenge is exemplified by the nonlinear behavior of the velocities of the individual blade elements.The spectral representation of turbulence assumes stationary (or "slowly varying") coefficients, where these coefficients are functions of airspeed.From reference 1: "The frozen field concept (Taylor's hypothesis) … implies, in the frequency domain, that the temporal frequency (rad/sec) sensed by the airplane is related to the spatial frequency by the true airspeed V; that is, = V .Therefore the spectral densities are transformed to functions of as follows:( ) = 1 V = V ."The mathematical destinations of this transformation are the coefficients of turbulence filters.These filters produce velocity components from Gaussian inputs.The purpose of the filters is twofold.They produce an integrated power spectral density that is given by the variance 2 , and for the Dryden turbulence model, they shape the spectral form by imposing a first-order highfrequency asymptote.Translational turbulence filters are typically represented in Laplace notation:f s ( ) = 3p s + p 3 ( ) s + p ( )2The quantity p = V L is referred to herein as the "pole"; L is the characteristic scale length of turbulence in a particular dimension, the inverse of which is sometimes referred to as the "wave number."Applying this filter to an element on a blade, the notation V = V n,m is used, where n is the blade number and m is the element number.The cyclic behavior of element velocities in a rotor system presents an intractable problem to the discipline of simulation, unless a new approach is taken to turbulence simulation.A turbulence model is here derived called DOBEST (an acronym for the title of this paper), and this model is shown to create realistic turbulence velocities by applying mathematical algorithms amenable to real-time simulation.The effect of these algorithms is compared with a baseline model, which is determined to be inappropriate for simulation.This baseline model uses a thorough description of the aerodynamic velocity at each blade-element location.In the DOBEST model, average velocities are developed, as shown in appendix A. The filter coefficients for any radial station (on a "ring") are then stationary for a given vehicle airspeed and altitude, eliminating the cyclostationary problem of the baseline model.Body-axis disturbances utilize the vehicle's aerodynamic velocity V = V RW , and their filters are applied at the distributed aerodynamic centers of the vehicle.Hence, these components are similar to those used in turbulence for conventional aircraft simulations.A complete baseline model, as well as the DOBEST model, is developed here.Although the baseline model contains an accurate representation of rotary dynamics, it produces divergent responses and meaningless energy metrics because of its cyclostationary filter coefficients.The DOBEST model does not have these problems.Rotational turbulence filters are also used in turbulence models for conventional aircraft.However, in a distributed aircraft model, rotational responses are induced from position-dependent forces created by function evaluations using distributed aerodynamic velocities, including superimposed turbulence.Filters approximating rotational vehicle responses to turbulence are thus superfluous in a distributed model.
THE THEORYConsidering just a rotor system, turbulence filters model atmospheric disturbances, and these disturbances are superimposed upon the more profoundly developed physics of the rotating blades.In particular, airspeed differences on the advancing and retreating blades are accounted for in a blade-element rotor model such as that of reference 2. Since the filters are only spectral representations of turbulence, they do not have to be formulated as complete aerodynamic representations of blade activity, especially when such a formulation requires assumptions that invalidate the fundamental characteristic of the filters: outputs from linear filters excited by Gaussian noise remain Gaussian.This is not true when the filter coefficients are periodic functions of time.Such filters are "cyclostationary," and are nonlinear functions of time.The effect of cyclostationary filters is illustrated herein by use of a baseline model, where it is shown that it is not possible to establish meaningful energy metrics for the turbulent field.Consider the velocity of a blade-element located at a fixed radius r m from the hub, where the blades rotate with an angular velocity given by T .The azimuth angle of a blade is given byn = T dt + 2 n 1 NThis angle is measured from the aft centerline of the vehicle, and N is the number of blades.Nominally, the rotor's rpm is given by T = 27 rad / sec = 4.3 Hz for the Black Hawk model discussed herein, so that an element (n,m) velocity nominally has the frequency of 4.3 Hz.As shown in appendix A, by including both the aircraft and rotational velocity components with respect to the mean wind, the aerodynamic velocity for an element located at r m on the n th blade is given byV n, m = V RW 2 + T 2 r m 2 + 2 T r m V RW cos sin n + ( )This cyclic velocity, which may periodically vanish for an element whenever T r m V RW , is the component that produces cyclostationary filters, despite the fact that the rotational component T r m is quite large at all element stations.The element velocity V n,m , with its two subscripts representing blade number "n" and element number "m," is that used in the baseline model.Hence, only appreciable velocities are accommodated by filters using Taylor's hypothesis, and regions around reverse flow on a blade are certainly precluded.A design objective of the DOBEST model is to retain the military specification linear filters of reference 1, which deliver the required variance and first-order rolloff.Considering the above quote, the frozen-field concept becomes more valid by including the large rotational contributions in the velocity of each element.Indeed, the velocity then becomes so large that a discrete implementation of the filters indicates that an upper limit be imposed on the system pole ( p = V L ) for computational accuracy.This phenomenon is related to the Nyquist criterion.Using realistic cycle times, accuracy could degrade at high flight speeds during low altitude flight, unless the turbulence scale length in the vertical dimension is restricted to a minimum value.The DOBEST model is a new approach to simulating rotorcraft turbulence.A novel technique is used to distribute Gaussian noise to the geometrical locations of aerodynamic centers, including five elements located on each of four blades.These properly correlated values are then input to linear filters.The filter outputs retain the Gaussian characteristics of the inputs, and properly produce statistical correlation as a function of blade translation and rotation through a turbulent field.The DOBEST model is also designed to be very accurate when the magnitude of the scale length approaches that of the rotor diameter.This occurs for low-altitude flight.The nonlinear rotor model (ref.2) includes all of the cyclic dynamics, so the redundant inclusion of these dynamics in the creation of the incremental turbulence terms is not used in the DOBEST model.The baseline model, however, includes these cyclic dynamics and produces outputs that diverge.This phenomenon is shown in appendix B.Magnitude arguments exist for not including cyclostationary phenomena in the turbulence contributions to a rotorcraft model.If the airspeed is large, turbulence increments to the rotor system represent minor contributions to the gross cyclic velocities, and vast computational power need not be dedicated to improving the accuracy of superimposed stochastic variables, which are highly correlated.If the vehicle's airspeed is small, the increments are computed quite accurately without the inclusion of cyclostationary dynamics (as in the DOBEST model), and their contribution to rotorcraft responses becomes more important.This occurs because the correlation between the individual elements is then small, owing to small values of characteristic length (L).Low correlation can produce large rotational activity.For the rotor's turbulence filters the DOBEST model uses the average element velocities, as developed in appendix A. There is considerable precedence for this operation in the field of turbulence modeling:"… special consideration should be given to the anisotropic and nonhomogeneous nature of the turbulence.One way to sidestep this difficulty is to use average values of the turbulence model parameters…" (ref.1).Aerodynamic effects owing to velocity differences on advancing and retreating blades are otherwise handled in the blade-element model, and only stochastic disturbances are considered (not "discrete gusts").The rotor's filter coefficients thus remain stationary (i.e., "slowly varying"), because the turbulence filters for all elements at a given radius from the hub utilize an average aerodynamic velocity (single subscript) given byV m = 1 S m ( ) V RW 2 + T 2 r m 2 + 2 T r m V RW coswhere S m is a series developed in appendix A. This formulation invariably produces large velocities ( V m >212 ft/sec) in the rotor model's turbulence filter coefficients, independent of the direction of the mean wind.It also decreases the computational workload considerably, which nonetheless remains large, and avoids the cyclostationary dynamics that invalidate Gaussian assumptions.This invalidation for the baseline model is illustrated in appendix B.For body-fixed aerodynamic centers, the conventional implementation of turbulence is used.These filters utilize the true airspeed ( V RW ) of the vehicle, while inputs are distributed to aerodynamic centers.Great care is taken here to preserve the Gaussian characteristics of stochastic turbulence, and thus retain realistic metrics for the energy in the turbulent field.A novel interpolation algorithm is introduced that retains the turbulence variance in each axis of the rotorcraft, while producing the proper covariances between aerodynamic centers.If required, nonlinear variations in the energy field, such as patchy turbulence, may be included in the dispersion coefficients.The linear filter representation degrades for small aerodynamic velocities, because the filter's pole, zero, and gain vanish.This results in low-gain integration, and is shown to cause havoc in the baseline model.Nonetheless, turbulence occurs in real flight despite low vehicle velocity with respect to the mean wind, and is a very important phenomenon in modeling rotorcraft operations at low altitudes.Use of the average velocity at each element station avoids this problem in the DOBEST model.Especially for the vertical scale length L (as cited later), near sea level the turbulence wavelength approaches that of a typical rotor diameter, and in generating rotational disturbances the accompanying reduction in cross correlation is shown to be very important.Conversely, for high-altitude flight, where vehicle velocity is usually large, the characteristic scale length of turbulence is also large, such that the filter's pole ( V L ) remains reasonable.A large turbulence scale length (or altitude) is shown to produce a high degree of correlation throughout the rotor system.The theory may be summarized as follows: The proper distribution of Gaussian random variables throughout the rotor system is the dominating consideration in creating a representative simulation of rotorcraft turbulence.Turbulence filters merely shape the spectral form so that the required dispersions are delivered, while imposing a second-order high-frequency asymptote (for the Dryden spectral form of ref.It is suggested that a model for responses to discrete gusts, as required in a terrain-correlated program, may use a nonrotating four-point application concept similar to that discussed here.For gust models, this requires a relatively small computational workload in the transmittal of the data necessary to compute accurate aircraft gust responses.For example, wind vectors at four points about the vehicle, in addition to turbulence intensities applicable for the entire rotorcraft (usually given by the dispersions i ), are sufficient to compute aircraft gust and turbulence responses for a distributed model.This statement assumes that the standard military specification atmospheric model is used for the turbulence scale lengths.In terrain-correlated applications the turbulence wave number = 1 L may alternatively be used.This quantity is related to the turbulence dissipation rate in " k " models, as discussed in reference 4. In this case the filter pole becomes p = V , where the components of are also applicable for the entire rotorcraft.The four-point concept may benefit gust models such as that of reference 4, where the data-acquisition points should be distributed symmetrically about the rotorcraft at a radius equal to the square root of two times the outboard element radius r 5 (in order to define a box around a rotor system that includes all element radii plus the tail rotor).By orienting the acquisition points along the vehicle horizontal axes, the position of the tail rotor is interior to the delineated area.The implied interpolation scheme, that is using simple geometrical relationships to the aerodynamic centers of a distributed model, is superior to the transmittal of atmospheric gradient data, because the aircraft's geometry is then considered, and linearity between data points is not assumed."Also, it should be mentioned here that the aerodynamic effects of gust gradients are not quite the same as the effects of the airplane angular velocities" (ref.1).This is an important consideration in evaluating the performance of different vehicles in similar gust and turbulence environments.For simplification in this derivation, the tail rotor is assumed to be coincident with the empennage and horizontal tail; also the main rotor hub is assumed to be coincident with the vehicle center-of-mass.These assumptions do not appear to be significant for the distribution of stochastic turbulence in the Black Hawk model.The techniques may be extended for models with different geometry, such as a rotorcraft with two main rotors, and with minimal computational workload, additional aerodynamic centers may be included by use of the distribution algorithm.In figure 1 a circle of diameter L is defined, where L is the symmetric characteristic scale length of turbulence in the vehicle x-y plane, which is a function of altitude.The rotor hub is located at the center of the circle, and the rotor radius R T is a fraction of the radius L/2.The location of the tail rotor is also within the circle, because its distance from the rotor hub is less than L/2 for minimum L. From a military specification (ref.5), the minimum value of L in the x-y plane is 75.64 ft.The distance from the main rotor hub to the tail rotor of the Black Hawk model is R G = 32 ft .The main rotor radius is R T = 26.83ft, which includes the hinge offset e = 1.25 ft and the spar length e = 2.25 ft.Using the equal annuli algorithm of reference 2, the radius from the main rotor hub to a blade station, r m , may be computed fromr m = e + e ( ) 2 + 2m 1 2M R T 2 e + e ( )2[ ] ewhere the blades are modeled using 1 m M segments; nominally M = 5.For five radial stations the equal annuli algorithm produces the radial positions (ft) and rotational velocities (ft/sec) shown in table 1.The average element velocities used in the DOBEST model are never less than these rotational velocity components.A variable rotor rpm is not excluded in this model.For most flight regimes the scale length L is large compared to the rotor diameter.In this case turbulence throughout the rotorcraft is highly correlated.However, at sea level L approaches the rotor diameter, in a proportion similar to that illustrated in figure 1.As is discussed, correlation then becomes a very important phenomenon.
THE DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHMFour uncorrelated, unity-variance, zero-mean, Gaussian random variables ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) per translational axis are assumed available in the following derivation.Independent noise sources are not necessarily required to create these variables in discrete simulation; sequential values from a single source with a long period may also be used.For all three axes, these variables may be represented by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( ) k , where k = 1, 2,3 represents the vehicle's x-y-z axes.Rotations are used to distribute these variables over both the rotor system and the vehicle geometry.A rotation matrix in the x-y plane is developed by weighting the independent variables as functions of their angles of rotation:μ i = a + b cos i + j 1 ( ) 2 j j= 1 4Using the expected value operator E, the Gaussian characteristics of the original noise sources (except independence) are preserved whenE μ i 2 { } = 4a 2 + 2b 2 = 1 E μ i μ i+ 2 { } = 4a 2 2b 2 = 0These relationships yield a = 1 8 and b = 1 2 .The rotations are functions of the azimuth angles of the individual blades, but may be written as a function of the azimuth angle of just one blade, 1 .Where S = sin 1 and C = cos 1 , the rotation matrix isμ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 μ 5 μ 6 = 1 8 1 + 2C 1+ 2S 1 2C 1 2S 1 2S 1 + 2C 1+ 2S 1 2C 1 2C 1 2S 1 + 2C 1+ 2S 1+ 2S 1 2C 1 2S 1 + 2C 1 + 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1+ 2 1 1 2 3 4Note that six correlated variables have been created from the original four uncorrelated variables (per axis).These six variables remain unity-variance, zero-mean, Gaussian random variables.As illustrated in figure 2, the first four rotated variables in the above set are associated with individual blades, whereas the latter two rotated variables are associated with the vehicle's longitudinal body axis.The rotated variables are in a plane coincident with the vehicle's longitudinal and lateral axes, on a circle of diameter L.The application points of the first four variables are extensions of the four blades, at a radius L/2 from the rotor hub; L has a minimum value of 75.64 ft.The latter two longitudinal random variables do not rotate with the rotor system, and are used to create random variables along the longitudinal body axis.If the lateral dimension of the aircraft also has significant aerodynamic centers, two lateral variables may easily be defined.For example, variables μ 7 and μ 8 may be created for this purpose.They would be similar to μ 5 and μ 6 , but rotated 90 degrees.All aerodynamic centers represented in a distributed rotorcraft model are then accommodated by use of these variables.The body-fixed variables display the proper statistical relationships with respect to the rotor system variables.For each of the rotated random variables, either along the longitudinal axis or distributed on the rotating blades, the variance is unity,E μ i 2 { } = 1For random variables with the above characteristics the correlation coefficient between individual components is also the covariance.For opposing-blade and bodyaxis random variables the covariances are all zero,E μ 1 μ 3 { }= E μ 2 μ 4 { }= E μ 5 μ 6 { }= 0However, considering the rotor system, adjacent blades are correlated, and their covariances are given byE μ 1 μ 2 { }= E μ 1 μ 4 { }= E μ 2 μ 3 { }= E μ 3 μ 4 { }= 1 2From the above relationships, the random variable at the hub may be expressed by,μ 0 = 1 8 μ i i= 1 4 = 1 2 μ 5 + μ 6 ( )= 1 2 i i=1 4The covariance from the hub to any of the six random variables isE μ 0 μ i { }= 1 2
CORRELATIONThe distance L is the characteristic length of turbulence in the vehicle's x-y plane, and this length defines the distance at which the correlation between points vanishes.Hence, for two points separated by a distance 2 r m , the correlation between zero-mean, unity-variance variables at these points may be defined by a function that is unity when they are coincident, and zero when their separation is equal to the characteristic scale length.Defining a normalized distance between two identical-radius segments on opposing blades,d m = 2r m Lan exponential correlation coefficient is defined that meets these requirements:m = 1 d m ( )e d mA compatible linear form is also examined.These definitions permit the use of a novel interpolation algorithm for the creation of random variables at all blade-element locations, and the variables have the same unity variances and zero means.Turbulence filters are then applied at each element location, because their inputs are unique.However, considerable simplification occurs in the DOBEST model because the utilized velocity of all four blades is identical at any given radial station.The DOBEST model makes use of the fact that Gaussian variables passing through linear filters remain Gaussian.This is not true if cyclostationary filters are used, as is the case in the baseline model.The Black Hawk has N = 4 blades, and each element on each blade contributes forces (and hence moments) to the total rotorcraft model.In the DOBEST model the filter poles are a function of only the radial index (m = 1,2,3,4,5), and not the blade index (n = 1,2,3,4).Because the velocities V m have been defined (see appendix A) as independent of n , only five sets of filter coefficients are required for each of the three rotor system axes.For the blade elements, 20 separate inputs are created from the interpolation scheme (from four random variables) per axis.This algorithm is a twodimensional extension of earlier work described in references 3 and 6.Figure 3 identifies the locations at which the rotated variables ( μ i ) are used, in order to create variables ( i ) applicable at the various radial and body-axis stations.The rotor system is discussed first, where the variables ( 1, m , 2,m , 3,m , 4,m ) are created in the rotating frame for each of the three aircraft dimensions.From the four blade variables per dimension, the hub variable 0 = μ 0 is created per dimension, which is generalized here to be the center-of-mass variable.For locations along the x-body axis the additional variables μ 5 and μ 6 are required in order to interpolate the covariances.In this simplified model these two variables are used to create a correlated random variable 5 (per dimension) at the location of the tail rotor.
THE ROTOR SYSTEMSince the rotation matrix is a cyclic function of time, the random variables μ i contain periodic behavior in sampling the original noise sources i .In this section the individual blade-element random variables of figure 3 ( n ,m ) are developed; they also contain the periodic behavior.This distribution thus yields an accurate description of the random noise sources at each rotating blade-element location.Where the first index identifies a particular blade, for any element the random variable at r m is n,m ,1, m = A m μ 1 + B m μ 3 2 ,m = A m μ 2 + B m μ 4 3,m = A m μ 3 + B m μ 1 4 ,m = A m μ 4 + B m μ 2where the coefficients areA m = 1 2 1+ m + 1 m ( ) B m = 1 2 1 + m 1 m ( )In computing the covariance between any point r n1,m1 and another point r n2,m2 , general relationships exist, depending only on the blade indices.For the same blade, adjacent blades and opposing blades, these covariances are, respectively,E n1,m1 n2 ,m2 { }= A m 1 A m 2 + B m 1 B m 2 n 1 n 2 = 0 1 2 A m1 + B m1 ( )Am 2 + B m 2 ( ) n 1 n 2 = 1 ,3 A m1 B m2 + A m2 B m1 n 1 n 2 = 2For any segment on any blade the variance isE n,m 2 { } = A m 2 + B m 2 = 1When blades are adjacent, as in the following example, the covariance between equal-radii elements is given by14 ,m = E r 1, m r 4,m { } = 1 2 A m + B m ( ) 2 = 1 2 1 + m ( )The same equation computes 1 2,m , 2 3,m and 3 4, m , where blade indices such as "12" are interchangeable.When the blades oppose each other, the covariances are13,m = E r 1, m r 3, m { } = 2A m B m = m 24,m = E r 2,m r 4,m { } = 2A m B m = mThese covariances vanish if a radial station r m could be as large as L/2, where m vanishes, and they approach unity as the radial stations approach the rotor hub, where m approaches unity ( d m vanishes).The covariances are illustrated in figure 4. Also included is the covariance between the hub and radii from the hub.For low-altitude flight, a blade's elemental stations are given as solid circles and the tail is given as an open circle.As altitude increases, the value for L increases such that d m decreases.These points thus migrate toward the ordinate with increasing altitude, and the elements receive more correlated inputs.At the outboard blade-element station for the Black Hawk's rotor model, the largest possible value is d 5 = 0.641 , at sea level.At an altitude of 1,000 ft the value decreases to d 5 = 0.048.As indicated in figure 4, the rotor inputs become more correlated for high altitudes, because the points migrate to the left (L gets larger so d m gets smaller).However, as shown in figure 4, correlation is important for low-altitude flight.Element disturbances become less correlated, and this causes an increase in the vehicle's rotational activity, as will be shown.The linear formulation produces more correlation between the blade elements, and this produces less rotational activity at all altitudes.The linear form is that discussed in reference 1, although those authors probably never envisioned helicopter applications.It is useful to keep in mind the "tweaking" that is usually required.From reference 1: "The turbulence model … has been developed by rather arbitrarily choosing reasonable values of the scales and then determining values for the intensity so that the mathematical spectral form … fits the measured spectral data …".
If a linear formulation for the covariance was used,
THE CENTER OF MASSWhere the hub position is given as r 0 = 0, the coefficients becomeA 0 = B 0 = 1 2and the three previously shown covariance relationships collapse to a single relationship.The covariance between the hub and any segment of any blade is0,m = E 0 m ,n { }= 1 2 A m + B m ( )= 1 + m 2The random variable and variance at the hub are0 = μ 0 = 1 2 μ 5 + μ 6 ( ) E 0 2 { } = 1Assuming this point to be coincident with the vehicle center of mass, 0 becomes the center-of-mass random variable, properly correlated with the blade's random variables.However, neither the hub nor the tail rotates with the blades, so their turbulence filters must use an alternative velocity specification (the true airspeed V RW ) to that used by the rotor system's individual elements.
THE TAILIn order to create turbulence at the tail, interpolation is used between μ 5 and μ 6 .These independent variables are also located at a distance L/2 from the hub, but are not rotating with the blades.As above, a correlation distance and coefficient are defined:d T = 2r G L T = 1 d T ( )e d TAs in the formulation for the individual blade elements, the coefficients become,A T = 1 2 1+ T + 1 T ( ) B T = 1 2 1+ T 1 T ( )The tail's random variable and covariance between the hub and tail are given by5 = A T μ 5 + B T μ 6 0T = E 0 5 { } = 1+ T 2For the Black Hawk model at sea level d T = 0.8461, T = 0.066 and 0T = 0.73.At the outboard segment for adjacent blades the correlation drops to 0.595, and for opposing blades it drops to 0.189.All of the cross-correlations are shown in figure 6.All of the indicated points migrate toward the ordinates of these graphs with increasing altitude.Correlations between the individual elements and the tail are not shown in figure 6 because they are periodic functions of azimuth angle:E 5 1,m { } = 1 2 1 + T ( )1 + m ( )+ 1 T ( )1 m ( )cos 1 E 5 2,m { }= 1 2 1 + T ( )1 + m ( ) 1 T ( )1 m ( )sin 1 E 5 3, m { } = 1 2 1 + T ( )1+ m ( ) 1 T ( )1 m ( )cos 1 E 5 4,m { }= 1 2 1+ T ( )1 + m ( )+ 1 T ( )1 m ( )sin 1
TURBULENCE FILTERSThe filter inputs developed in the preceding sections are properly correlated.The blade-element inputs even contain rotary effects in sampling random noise.In fact, the problem of creating rotorcraft turbulence would be completely solved by the above operations if a constant relationship existed between the distributed noise and the resultant turbulence velocities.Alas, Taylor et al. determined that transfer functions are required, and those functions consist of filters that have coefficients that are functions of altitude and airspeed.For a rotor system, where element velocities are nonlinear, the airspeed functionality presents an unusual modeling challenge.In the previous sections a field of random variables has been created that displays the proper correlation between the aerodynamic centers of the rotorcraft.For example, as a blade passes the aft azimuth position, its outboard element receives inputs that are almost identical to those received by the tail rotor.By passing these inputs through linear filters the power spectral densities are shaped, while the correlation is retained.The shaping function is based on a pass band, which is determined by the filter pole.In the next section the rotor systems filters are determined to be second order.However, first-order systems seem to be gaining some popularity in terrain-and ship-correlated applications.Computer science techniques are used to produce low-pass filters that avoid significant aliasing.This is alluded to in the literature: "To ensure stability of the real-time turbulence filters, the model software includes safeguards that limit the frequencies of the filters to a magnitude not greater than one-quarter of the simulation sampling frequency."This is equivalent to sampling the random variables every four computer cycles, and seems to be an effective technique for producing sharply attenuated low-pass responses.From references 1, 5 and 7, Table 2 is presented to show the parameters to be used in turbulence filters according to the Dryden spectral form in military specifications (the references are shown in the table).2L u u 2 1 + L u ( ) 2 [ ] 2L u u 2 1 + L u ( ) 2 [ ] 2L u u 2 1 + L u ( ) 2 [ ] v ( ) L v v 2 1 + 3 L v ( ) 2 [ ] 1+ L v ( ) 2 [ ] 2 L v v 2 1 + 3 L v ( ) 2 [ ] 1+ L v ( ) 2 [ ] 2 2L v v 2 1 + 3 2L v ( ) 2 [ ] 1+ 2L v ( )2[ ]2 w ( ) L w w 2 1+ 3 L w ( ) 2 [ ] 1+ L w ( ) 2 [ ] 2 L w w 2 1+ 3 L w ( ) 2 [ ] 1+ L w ( ) 2 [ ] 2 2L w w 2 1+ 3 2L w ( ) 2 [ ] 1 + 2L w ( ) 2 [ ]2The function of altitude f h appearing in this table is given byf h = 0.177 + 0.000823hUpon inspection of Table 2, the 1990 formulation is equivalent to the 1980 formulation.The halved scale lengths ( L v , L w ) in the 1990 model have been accommodated by a redefinition of the spectral characteristics.This confusing notation shift is ignored here, and the 1980 formulation is used.The scale lengths L u and L v in the x-y plane are then identical.Furthermore, since the DOBEST model makes no distinction in the direction of travel, u collapses to v .The required parameters for the turbulence filters then become,L = L u = L v = 75.64 h 10 hf h 1. 2 10 < h 1000 h 1000 < h 1750 1750 h 1750 L w = 10 h 10 h 10 < h 1750 1750 h > 1750 = u = v = w f h 0. 4 h 1000 w h > 1000For the rotor system the spatial spectra all becomeU ,V ,W [ ] ( ) = L i i 2 1 + 3 L i ( ) 2 [ ] 1 + L i ( ) 2 [ ]2Hence, all of the Laplace filters have the same form.They are given by the critically damped systems,u m s ( ) = v m s ( ) = 3V m L s + V m 3L ( ) s + V m L ( ) 2 w m s ( ) = w 3V m L w s + V m 3L w ( ) s + V m L w ( )2Using the Dryden form these filters are developed by decomposing ( ) into a function j ( ) times its conjugate, and the Laplace forms are extracted.This process is more complicated for the von Karman spectral form."The Dryden form has been chosen because it is simple to mechanize, as opposed to the von Karman form that must be approximated to become realizable" (ref.7).The von Karman form is also used at Ames Research Center.In the next section the minimum value for L w is shown to be larger than the value of 10 ft given in table 2 using realistic cycle times, owing to sample data phenomena.
BANDWIDTH CONSIDERATIONSThe bandwidth of a system is defined as that range of frequencies over which the system responds "satisfactorily.The basic problem with a high bandwidth, however, has to do with the discrete modeling of transfer functions that were developed using conventional aircraft parameters.For this discussion we need a couple of quantities.Defining the "pole" and its discrete equivalent,p = V L = p tthe Laplace transfer function representing unitydispersion turbulence may be writtenf s ( ) = A s + p 3 ( ) s + p ( ) 2Its power spectral density is given byf j ( ) 2 = A 2 2 + p 2 3( )2 + p 2 ( )2By integrating the spectrum, the total power is determined, and it must be unity:P = 1 = f j ( ) 2 d 0 = A 2 3pFrom this expression the continuum gain is produced,A = 3pFor a discrete system, the zero-order data-hold formulation is used for both stability and accuracy,F z ( ) = 1 e s t s f s ( )This produces the z-transformF z ( ) = A Bz+ C ( ) 3p z e ( )2In this equation the coefficients areB = 1 e + 3 1 ( ) e C = e 2 e 31( ) eThe discrete power spectral density is given byF e j t ( ) 2 = A 2 B 2 + C 2 + 2BC cos t ( ) 3 p 2 1 + e 2 2e cos t ( )2By integrating this spectrum to the Nyquist frequency the total power in discrete simulation is computed:P z = 1 t F e j t ( ) 0 2 d t ( )This producesP z = A 2 1 e ( )2 3 1( )2 2 e 2 + 31( ) e + 1 e 2 [ ] 2 3p 1 e 2 ( )3Substituting the continuum gain, the total power obtained in simulation is seen to be a function of only the equivalent discrete pole , and is in general, not unity:P z = 1 e ( )2 3 1( )2 2 e 2 + 31( ) e + 1 e 2 [ ] 2 1 e 2 ( )3The degradation in total discrete power is shown in figure 7. Also shown in figure 7 is a second-order curve fit to P z , which is quite accurate in the indicated range.Of course, the discrete gain could be normalized, and this would produce unity total power in discrete simulation.However, this invariably amplifies the spectrum over the discrete bandwidth.This is shown in figure 8, where the discrete curves extend only to the Nyquist frequency of 50 Hz.The value = 0.8 was used to create figure 8.The total power is the integral under these curves, and since the continuum curve extends to infinity, its area (of unity) is greater than that of the curve tagged "Discrete Power," which is P z = 0.8914 in figure 8.The curve tagged "Discrete Power w/Normalized Gain" has the desired unity total power, but the accompanying distortion is not acceptable.As is indicated by figure 8, the continuum gain A must be retained in order to preserve the frequency response over a significant portion of the discrete bandwidth.Hence, must be limited, and as is shown below, this implies that, for the rotor system transfer functions, L must have a minimum value that is greater than the value of 10 ft given in table 2. This conclusion is not the result of atmospheric physics; it is simply the result of sampled data theory.If the sample period could be significantly reduced below the value of 0.01 sec, then limiting L w for the rotor's filters would not be required.Similar problems have arisen in the discrete simulation of rotor systems throughout the years.For example, reference 8 describes the undesirable aliasing phenomenon associated with cycle times that are too large to accommodate the high frequencies that are generated in a rotor system.Essentially, problems arise in the discrete simulation of a transfer function when the discrete spectrum magnitude remains significant at frequencies that are an appreciable fraction of the Nyquist frequency (usually as observed on a log-frequency plot), such that manifest aliasing occurs.As may be seen in figure 9, a lower limit on the discrete pole of about 0.25 will preserve about 98.83% of the total power.When this change is made, figure 8 is transformed into figure 9, where = 0.25.The loss of total power by allowing to be somewhat larger than 0.25 does not seem to severely influence time histories, but it does alter the covariances in the rotor system.That is, observed cross correlations using spectral techniques depart from their theoretical values because of the disproportionate loss in power at the outboard segment locations.Thus, from a purely mathematical point of view, the artifact of placing a lower limit on L w in the rotor computations of the DOBEST model is justified.This produces an upper limit on the pole sizemax = 0.25= p max t V n ,m t L minThis limitation permits the realization of an accurate discrete solution that accomplishes the original goals of the filters:1. Normalize the total power delivered so that meaningful dispersions may be applied 2. Produce a critically damped solution from the denominator polynomial of the filter 3. Produce a second-order roll off beyond the pass band in conformance with the Dryden atmospheric spectral relationships 4. Produce relatively flat responses for frequencies in the pass band 5. Retain the Gaussian characteristics of the input noise through the filters such that all of the covariance relationships given here apply to the filtered outputs These goals are not met if the equivalent discrete pole takes liberties with sampled data theory.Hence, the discrete pole has an upper limit given by max , atmospheric physics notwithstanding.It should be kept in mind that the above analysis is for a static system.The upper limit on the discrete pole does not eliminate the divergence inherent in the baseline model, which is caused by periodically becoming too small (vanishing velocity).As shown in appendix A for the baseline model, the maximum element velocity is available from any blade's outboard element:V n,5 = T r 5 + V RWAssuming t = 0.01 sec, this equation, combined with the above inequality for max , produces a minimum value for the characteristic length:L min 26.2 + V RW 25This value only rises to 38.2 ft at a velocity of 300 ft/sec, so that it is invariably below the limit of 75.64 ft imposed in table 2 for L ( L u or L v ).Hence, the limit only applies to the vertical characteristic length used by the rotor system filters, L w .In the DOBEST model the maximum element velocity is always less than or equal to the maximum of the baseline model.Hence, the lower limit on L w produces an even more reasonable range for in the DOBEST model.
NOISE SOURCE CONSIDERATIONSIn the previous section a z-transform relationship was developed.Such relationships relate an input "x" to an output turbulence velocity "v".Operations were performed to produce the total power P z , where these operations assumed that the input "x" had a unity total power integral.Otherwise "v" is biased by the input.This must be considered in order to create the correct gain for a difference equation driven by a noise source.For instance, the relationship may be written asF z ( ) = A Bz+ C ( ) 3p z e ( ) 2 = v z ( ) x z ( )where x z ( ) is computed from a noise source z ( ) with non-unity total power.In particular, a noise source called XNORM is used at Ames Research Center.It produces values with a Gaussian magnitude distribution in the range ±3.45 when the dispersion is unity; this range includes 99.95% of the continuous probability integral.For the frequency distribution, the power spectral density is flat (white) over the discrete bandwidth, and is given by ( )2 = 0 < 0 t 0 t 0 > tThe power is thus a constant over the Nyquist range, and in terms of noise values z ( ) created by XNORM they may be used in the above z-transform only ifz ( ) = x z ( ) ( ) = t x z ( )Hence, with respect to noise inputs with unity variance, the z-transform for velocity becomesv z ( ) z ( ) = t A 3 p Bz+ C ( ) z e ( ) 2 = 1 p t Bz+ C ( ) z e( )The difference equation for real-time simulation, including the dispersion, is then given byv i+1 = 2e v i e 2 v i 1 + 1 B i + C i 1 ( ) A procedure
PERFORMANCETurbulence velocities are developed in the DOBEST model as shown in appendix C. For example, considering the vertical axis of a blade, an element's turbulence velocity with respect to its input is given by a z-transform relationship that is only a function of the radial index:w n,m n,m = F z,m ( )Through the aerodynamic relationships at each element station, a force is produced that is proportional to this velocity, which produces a torque depending on the moment arm.For rolling moments, the moment arms are the lateral distance from the hub, such that each element produces a torque proportional to  The input Gaussian noise histories were repeated for each of the flight conditions shown in figure 10.This means that the random variable inputs i were identical for each case.Since L is a function of altitude, the interpolation coefficients are also functions of altitude.Hence, the correlations between the random variables n ,m are also functions of altitude.The vertical turbulence filters use the characteristic length L w , which is also a function of altitude.The observed response differences are therefore caused entirely by altitude variations.The spectra from figure 10 (created by using a long time-history) are presented in figure 11.The vertical velocity spectra for each of the five segments (of one blade) are presented in figures 10a, 10c, and 10e.Roll torque spectra are presented in figures 11b, 11d, and 11f.When the altitude is low, as in figures 11a and 11b, the spectra are essentially flat out to about the rotor rpm.This occurs because the correlation between inputs is low.As altitude increases, the correlation between inputs gets larger, and the spectral magnitude gets smaller.As shown in figures 11d and 11f, the rpm then dominates the frequency response.These isolated responses of rotor turbulence generated by DOBEST are relatively insensitive to the airspeed, which in these cases was 200 ft/sec.This insensitivity is discussed in appendix B. Similar torque histories occur for the pitch axis.The yaw axis is relatively insensitive to rotor turbulence for a fully articulated rotor system.The roll torques shown in figures 10 and 11 are not allinclusive.They are only the incremental stochastic disturbance components.Within the rotor model, these increments are added to the large cyclic velocities of the individual blade elements, which become more pronounced with increased vehicle velocity.These total element velocities are then used in aerodynamic lookup tables.Airspeed variations on advancing and retreating blades are thus computed using DOBEST in a distributed rotor model.
FREQUENCY FOLDINGAs the blades track each other in a rotor system, an important phenomenon occurs.The frequency at the rpm ( T = 27 rad/sec) folds to higher harmonics that are multiples of the number of blades.This occurs for summations of blade contributions, such as in the torque proportionality equation.It occurs because for periodic behavior such as flapping, the dynamics of a given blade are essentially those of another blade, shifted in time (or multiples of 90 degrees).This phenomenon was examined in reference 8.The phenomenon, however, does not occur for the stochastic components of turbulence, and is not observed in figures 11b, 11d, and 11f, which represent vehicle torque contributions owing to stochastic turbulence.For stochastic turbulence, the reason why frequency folding under blade summation does not occur is that the velocities of the elements on a blade are not time-shifted replications of another blade.They are statistically correlated velocities that occur at the same time.This is illustrated in figure 12, where the vertical velocity histories of all four blades are given.The interval of time that is shown represents two complete rotor revolutions, and element velocities are displayed for the case of h = 500 ft and V RW = 200 ft/sec.The inboard-element velocity appears at the top of each graph, and the outboard-element velocity is at the bottom.It takes 0.0582 sec for a blade to travel 90 degrees.If this delay occurred between the velocities of blades that are separated by 90 degrees, it would be obvious in figure 12. Hence, as was shown in figures 11a, 11c, and 11e, there are no periodic components in the superimposed turbulence velocities of the DOBEST model.Thus, these velocities cannot contribute to the N/rev phenomenon when they are transformed and summed into the vehicle axes.This is verified by figures 11b, 11d, and 11f.The 1/rev amplification for high-altitude flight, shown in figure 11f, is a result of the total roll torque summation, which has the one-per-rev frequency content when the blade velocities are highly correlated, but have (slightly) different magnitudes, as shown in figure 12.Body-axis contributions (hub, tail) to turbulence have not been illustrated here, although the required random variables at the pertinent locations have been derived.These contributions utilize the vehicle velocity with respect to the mean wind in their filter representations.This velocity is typically lower-limited to about 10 ft/sec in discrete simulation.In hover, it is anticipated that body-axis contributions will be small compared to the rotor contributions, except for yaw disturbances.In testing the SORBET model of reference 3, pilots did not detect any improvement in yaw performance when tail rotor disturbances were added to the simulation (but SORBET did not feature the low hub-to-tail correlation developed here).Yaw activity is certain to increase with low correlation between hub and tail disturbances.As shown in appendix B, the performance of the baseline model is not acceptable at any velocity condition except V RW = 0, where it collapses to the DOBEST model.Fortunately, the workload of the DOBEST model is an order of magnitude less than that required for the "baseline" model.
CONCLUSIONSA stochastic turbulence model, called DOBEST, has been developed for rotorcraft simulation.It represents a new approach to turbulence simulation and overcomes many of the difficulties associated with low aerodynamic velocities.In this model, turbulence is treated by superimposition, and Gaussian statistical properties are preserved through stationary atmospheric filters.Random inputs from discrete noise sources are cyclically distributed to the locations of finite elements on the rotating blades.Rotor disturbances are then developed independent of periodic, asymmetric airspeeds at blade-element locations.This is accomplished by use of stationary filter coefficients that utilize an average aerodynamic velocity at each radial station.The algorithm thus avoids the intractable problem of cyclostationary turbulence filters.Body-axis disturbances are treated in the conventional fashion, except that turbulence is distributed to the aerodynamic centers of the model.Spectral relationships are developed as functions of turbulence scale length in each dimension, and the reduction in correlation for low-altitude flight is shown to severely influence the vehicle's rotational responses.The DOBEST model produces only stochastic turbulence.It may be used to augment discrete gust models, where inputs are from tables created by CFD analysis, as functions of location with respect to terrain or a ship, as in the JSHIP application.Terraincorrelated gust velocities, as well as pertinent energy variables, may be shared with DOBEST.Transfer function poles would be controlled by energy considerations of the gust model.The superimposition of random components of turbulence to gust models should add value to piloted simulation for low-speed and hovering operations around ships and other structures.minimum value occurs for that element m which has a rotational velocity T r m closest to the vehicle velocity V RW .Mathematically, the crossover phenomenon begins to occur for an airspeedV RW > r 1 + r 2 () T 2 , which is 291.54 ft/sec.This velocity is beyond the operational capabilities of the Black Hawk.The different blade velocities at a particular element radius r m are out of phase by multiples of 2 .This is shown in figure 14, where just the inboard (first) element velocity is displayed, for all four blades, and at the same airspeed used in figure 13.In figures 13 and 14 the inboard element's radial velocity is very close to the vehicle velocity, and thus nearly vanishes periodically.Therefore, this element's pole ( p = V n,m L ) in its turbulence filter also vanishes periodically.This phenomenon is particularly destructive, and will be shown to produce divergent responses.Element turbulence velocities generally become aberrant owing to these periodic velocities, as used by the baseline model.
DOBEST VelocitiesIn the DOBEST model, the average cyclostationary velocity of an element is used, where the average is obtained by integrating over the rotor plane azimuth angle n .The average element velocity V m (single subscript) at the radial station r m is produced in the following derivation ( n becomes a dummy variable of integration):V m = b m 2 1 + a m 2 sin n d n 0 2 = 2b m 1 + a m 2 1 m 2 sin 2 y dy 0 2 = b m 1 + a m 2 1 S m [ ]= c m 1 S m [ ]In this equation, If coefficients ( j = 1, 2, 3 J ) are predefined,R j = 1 2 j 1 1 1 2i 2 i=1 jthe real-time workload consists of only the J combinations,S m = m 2 j R j j =1 J m 2 < 1 1 2 m 2 = 1A value of about J = 10 is suggested for the series because it converges rather slowly as m approaches unity.For a few high values of m the convergence is illustrated in figure 15.The value for m = 1 is also shown by the dotted line.The series representation is applicable only for m <1.The variable m is unity only if = 0 and V RW = T r m , and if this occurs the closed form representation is used.If V RW = 0, m = 0 also, and the average element velocity is at its minimum value V m = T r m .As indicated in figure 15, accurate values for the average velocity are produced by taking only a few terms in the series (J = 10).In contrast to figures 13 and 14, the resultant, average element velocities are independent of the azimuth angle.They are functions of the vehicle airspeed, the element radii, and the rotor system's angle of attack.The average velocity values are not the average values of the extrema of V n,m .Element 1 is the inboard element on a blade, and its rotational velocity is smaller than that of any other element.Hence, its boundaries are the smallest for any airspeed.The extreme element velocities, as well as the average element velocities, are as shown in figure 16 for the case of = 0.This figure takes great liberties with the operational velocity capability of the Black Hawk, which is less than 300 ft/sec.It is presented from a mathematical point of view only, in order to display the limits and averages, as V RW approaches T r m .A compilation of the average element velocities is presented in figure 16f.Using the operational velocity range for the Black Hawk, only the inboard element actually experiences the reverseflow phenomenon.This is shown in figure 17a.The average velocities of the elements are different, but they vary little with airspeed from their values at V RW = 0.This is seen in figure 17f.Hence, turbulence responses using the DOBEST model display very little dependence on airspeed.This phenomenon is examined in appendix B. The extremes in average velocity are shown in table 3, where it is assumed that V RW max ( ) = 300 ft/sec.Only the inboard element shows a variation greater than 20%.Hence, as a function of airspeed, the filter poles ( p = V m L ) can only vary by this percentage in the DOBEST model.A feasible turbulence model for a rotor system could thus ignore airspeed variations.This "leap of faith," however, is not utilized in the DOBEST model developed herein.At V RW = 0 the turbulence ( u n,m ,v n,m ,w n,m ) owing to using the baseline velocity V n,m is identical to that using the average velocity V m , because all cyclostationary contributions vanish ( V n,m = V m ).Differences in turbulence between the baseline and DOBEST models occur only for V RW 0 .These differences are discussed in appendix B.
APPENDIX B: TURBULENCE RESPONSESFor both the baseline and DOBEST models, filter responses to random variable time histories are examined in this appendix.The baseline responses are shown to deliver outputs that tend to diverge if an element's tangential velocity periodically approaches that of the vehicle's airspeed.Periodic filter coefficients produce unequal dispersions for each element, and they are functions of both airspeed and altitude.This presents an intractable modeling problem, and meaningful metrics for turbulence energy cannot be established.Using the average element velocities of the DOBEST model, however, stationary filters are implemented at each element location, and, in response to random variables, their outputs deliver the correct dispersions, independent of airspeed and altitude.The turbulence trends for most elements have similarities for both models, except that the DOBEST model does not display the divergent element velocities of the baseline model, and energy metrics are retained.It is also shown that in the DOBEST model, vehicle airspeed has little influence on filter outputs.An element's rotational velocity component overwhelms airspeed influences to such an extent that airspeed may itself be ignored.This further simplification could be used to advantage because it vastly simplifies computations.The vertical turbulence velocity w n,m presents the greatest challenge in discrete computation, because the filter pole range is largest.This occurs because the scale length is smallest ( h = L w L ), and the pole in the vertical filter for an element is given by p = V n,m L w .As previously determined, the turbulence scale length L w is restricted to a minimum of 26.2 ft (at V RW = 0), despite the fact that altitude may be lower.For the baseline model, although this produces relatively large poles, they may also periodically vanish.This phenomenon cannot occur in the DOBEST model.The very low altitude of h = 10 ft is selected in the first sample for display, and it produces the largest system poles.Then the same display is given for the case of h = 500 ft, such that the system poles are reduced by an order of magnitude.Turbulent velocities versus time are displayed for 5 sec in these examples.The input dispersion used is w = 1 ft/sec.Both the baseline model and the DOBEST model are shown at four different airspeeds.All five of the vertical element velocities are given on each graph in figure 18, for one blade.The proximity of an element's tangential velocity to the airspeed produces the aberrant behavior.From table 1, these tangential components were given as 212 and 371 ft/sec for elements 1 and 2, respectively.When V RW is 200 ft/sec, as in figure 18e, the response of element 1 is aberrant.When it is 300 ft/sec, as in figure 18f, element 2 becomes aberrant.These aberrations are not dramatic for this case of h = 10 ft as is the case where h = 500 ft, because the poles are generally large, and rarely in their periodic, near-vanishing region.Statistically, significant differences nonetheless occur between the baseline and DOBEST models.The DOBEST model delivers the input unity dispersion, but the baseline model delivers dispersions that are a function of vehicle velocity, as well as element radius.The baseline model delivers the dispersions shown in figure 19.Dispersions were computed as a function of airspeed every 20 ft/sec, to a maximum of 1,000 ft/sec.Although this final airspeed is well over three times the operational capacity of the Black Hawk, these curves are presented only to illustrate the uniform degradation in turbulence metrics as the vehicle airspeed approaches that of any given element.The maxima of these curves occur at V RW = T r m .The maxima decrease with element number because the radial velocity increases with element number, that is, the higher the radial velocity, the less time the element's velocity spends around its lowest value.The cases in which h = 500 ft are much more illustrative.The poles are an order of magnitude smaller than those used in the previous graphs, so the aberrations are much more pronounced.In figure 20e only the inboard element (No. 1) actually diverges in the displayed time interval.This occurs because T r 1 approaches V RW = 200 ft/sec.In figure 20g both elements 1 and 2 begin to diverge.For the high-altitude cases of figure 20, the DOBEST model again delivers the input unity dispersion, but the baseline model fails to establish a meaningful energy metric.These data are shown in figure 21, where the dispersions should all be unity for all airspeeds.Once more, the graph takes great liberties with the operational capabilities of the Black Hawk.The errors are quite large in the operational velocity region below 300 ft/sec.These errors are further increased for higher altitude flight, because the filter's poles become correspondingly smaller.In comparing the baseline and DOBEST models, it is also of interest to look at all four blades at a specific flight condition.The parameters V RW = 200 ft/sec and h = 500 ft were used to create the next two sets of graphs.In figure 22 it is seen that the trend of element velocities in the baseline model is random, and they quickly diverge.These velocities are nonsensical.They cannot be superimposed on the other components of blade-element velocities in a rotor model because they would rapidly crash the vehicle.Because of the airspeed, the most divergent trace in figure 22 is for the inboard element.For the DOBEST model, the same parameters are used; the responses are given in figure 23.Note that the velocities are quite similar for all segments, and for all blades.The DOBEST model's outputs are relatively insensitive to vehicle velocity.This is seen in a comparison of figures 20b-20f and 20h.The filter pole, however, is inversely proportional to the characteristic length of turbulence, such that filter outputs are sensitive to altitude variations.From the DOBEST model, this is shown in figure 24, for three different altitudes and two different velocities.A comparison of the set of graphs in figure 24, by looking in the vertical dimension, shows that variations in altitude indeed alter the turbulence histories.The poles vary considerably with altitude because of the inverse relationship.However, a comparison of these graphs by looking in the horizontal dimension shows small differences.The distributed random inputs dominate the responses.Defining the filter poles as functions of element rotational velocity appears to produce a feasible model.Since the computation of the average velocity per element (see appendix A) has little influence on the results, the use of V RW = 0 in the rotor computations is probably sufficient for most applications.Nonetheless, the airspeed contribution is retained in the DOBEST model.
Fast FunctionsAs a function of time t i = i t , the trigonometric relationships of an arbitrary blade are available from computations in the rotor model:S C i = sin T t i ( ) cos T t i ( )For each cycle time the rotation matrix isT [ ]= 1 8 1+ 2C 1 + 2 S 1 2C 1 2 S 1 2 S 1+ 2C 1 + 2 S 1 2C 1 2C 1 2 S 1+ 2C 1 + 2 S 1 + 2 S 1 2C 1 2 S 1+ 2C 1 + 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1+ 2 1Twelve random variables are acquired in three sets, At the center of mass (variable 0) the filter solutions for the three vehicle axes are given by the difference equations, u 0, i = e u 0, i 1 + G 0, 1,i v 0 ,i = 2e v 0, i 1 e 2 v 0,i 2 + D 0,2, i + E 0 ,2,i 1 w 0, i = 2e w 0,i 1 e 2 w 0, i 2 + D 0,3, i + E 0,3,i 1These translational turbulence equations are the same as those used in conventional aircraft applications for the center of mass.For the distributed system the tail contribution (variable 5) is also included: Note that the longitudinal body filters use the first-order filters derived from table 2. All body-axis filters thus conform to models for conventional aircraft.For each blade element, of which there are 20, the three components of turbulence velocity are given by the difference equations, Considering all three vehicle axes, 60 velocity components are computed at the pertinent bladeelement locations, and are summed with the other velocity components of the rotor model.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.Introductory geometry.

APPENDIX A: FILTER VELOCITIESFor use in turbulence filter coefficients, blade-element velocities V n,m are developed in this appendix.These velocities include contributions from both the vehicle's aerodynamic velocity V RW and the element's velocity due to blade rotation T r m .The approximation of the DOBEST model is then introduced, where the cyclostationary components of the element velocities are averaged over a rotor revolution, producing V m .
Baseline VelocitiesThe total aerodynamic velocity of the vehicle V RW may be represented in the rotor system's hub frame byBecause mast angles are typically small, the hub frame is nearly coincident with the vehicle frame.The aerodynamic velocity V RW of the vehicle may be defined in terms of the angle of attack and sideslip with respect to the hub frame.The components of the aircraft's aerodynamic velocity are then given byThe hub frame is convenient for defining the total aerodynamic velocity of any element on any blade.The following parameters are used in this development.Neglecting blade flapping and lagging, each element's velocity is a function of both its azimuth angle n and its radial position r m :V n, m = V x + T r m sin n ( ) In figure 13 the inboard-element velocity V 1, 1 is shown using a solid line and the outboard-element velocity is shown by a dotted line.The other element velocities are also shown.For any vehicle velocity, the inequality V n,m 0 holds for all elements of all blades, so they may be used in the coefficients of the turbulence filters.For the baseline model this produces cyclostationary filters.The maximum and minimum values of the velocities used in the coefficients are given byFor the case of = 0, these extrema reduce to(These are plotted as boundary limits in figures 16 and 17).The velocity V n,m vanishes periodically wheneverAs indicated in figure 13, all of the element velocities on a particular blade are in phase.The maximum values occur when sin n = 1, and their magnitudes increase with segment number, m.The minimum values occur when sin n = -1, and their magnitudes do not necessarily increase with segment number.For instance, the lowest
APPENDIX C: REAL-TIME COMPUTATIONThe real-time workload is presented in this appendix for the DOBEST model.The workload for the baseline model is similar, but much more complicated because each and every element has its own unique filter coefficients at each instant of time.The workload is divided into two parts, where the first part consists of computations for slowly varying quantities.The computational workload of these equations may be segmented such that it is divided over a number of cycles.This is not true for the baseline model.The second part consists of computations that must be performed on each computer cycle.
Slowly Varying FunctionsSlowly varying quantities are computed as a function of altitude and vehicle velocity:
