IntroductionThis section provides context for the PDRC-IADS research activity, a high-level overview of the PDRC concept and an overview of the material presented in this document.
ScopeFuture air traffic demands are expected to require a greater degree of integration among the automation systems used to manage arrival, departure and surface traffic.The next generation air transportation system (NextGen) envisions Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface (IADS) operations as described in the JPDO Integrated Work Plan [38] and in the FAA's NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations [35].Various NextGen concepts [28, 31,32] describe IADS operations that feature a greater degree of automated coordination as traffic flows from one control domain to the next in the tactical air traffic control environment.A logical step towards the NextGen vision of fully-integrated arrival/departure/surface operations is to automate tactical scheduling of departure traffic that will join a constrained en route traffic flow as depicted in Figure 1:1, which is based on Figure 1-1 of Reference 28.A commonly used tactical Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) is the Call For Release (CFR) procedure, which is also known as the Approval Request (APREQ) procedure.CFR procedures vary from facility to facility; however, they generally require the Air Traffic Control Tower (Tower) to request approval from the Air Route Traffic Control Center (Center) prior to releasing departures headed to specified destinations.Earlier research [20,21] at NASA Ames focused on automating inter-facility coordination during CFR procedures.An FAA-led effort built on this work to develop and evaluate the Departure Flow Management prototype [13].Presently, en route tactical departure scheduling to meet CFR restrictions is often accomplished with the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) decision support tool.Tactical departure scheduling with TMA is thoroughly described in Section 0 of this document.The Precision Departure Release Capability (PDRC) combines the automated coordination demonstrated in the previous research [13,20,21] with the use of surface trajectory-based takeoff (OFF) time predictions and runway assignments to improve en route tactical departure scheduling during CFR procedures.PDRC is intended to inform development of mid-term NextGen concepts and technologies, but PDRC evaluations were conducted in the present-day National Airspace System (NAS) environment at a specific location.The scope for this document will be limited to the immediate PDRC-IADS research activity as follows:System: PDRC research software system developed for evaluations.This document includes notes and comments on extending the PDRC concept to other NAS environments.
IdentificationThe PDRC-IADS research activity is an element of the Systems Analysis Integration and Evaluation (SAIE) Project of NASA's Airspace Systems Program.The Aviation Systems Division at NASA Ames Research Center is conducting the PDRC-IADS research activity based out of NTX.Some of this research activity is being accomplished under a NASA Research Announcement contract (NNA11AC17C), which was awarded on 23 Sep 2011.Mosaic ATM, Inc. is the prime contractor for this work and CSC and Veracity Engineering are subcontractors.This document is a joint effort between NASA and contractor personnel.NASA and the FAA are coordinating NextGen technology transfer via Research Transition Teams (RTTs).The RTTs have defined Research Transition Products (RTPs), consisting of distinct concept and/or technology elements that can be transferred as a package.PDRC is one of four RTPs currently being coordinated by the IADS RTT.NASA delivered an initial PDRC RTP package to the FAA in July 2012.Formal delivery of the core PDRC RTP package is slated for the summer of 2013.This ConOps document will be one element of the PDRC RTP package.The FAA has identified the Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) Program and the Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) Program as recipients of the PDRC RTP.
1.3Document overview This document describes the PDRC Concept of Operations.Companion documents describe the technology that has been developed [2] and the evaluation and analytical results [3].The audience for this document includes the following:• The NASA PDRC-IADS team that will use this document to refine the concept throughout the research activity.• The NASA/FAA IADS RTT, which is facilitating the research transition process.• Other NASA NextGen researchers who may use this ConOps to coordinate research within NASA and with external research partners.• FAA NextGen implementers who may use this ConOps (and other PDRC research products) to inform development of IADS elements of the NextGen enterprise architecture.This document strictly follows the IEEE 1362-1998 standard [52] for concept of operations (ConOps) documents.IEEE 1362 was selected because it is very similar to the ConOps formats described in the FAA's NAS System Engineering Manual [53] and NASA's System Engineering Handbook [54].The standard format facilitates review and use of this ConOps by both NASA and FAA personnel.The FAA's NAS System Engineering Manual identifies three levels of concept documents (see section 4.4.5.2. of Reference 53) that are differentiated by scope and level of detail.Since this ConOps is narrowly focused on the PDRC system, it will likely be considered a concept of use (CONUSE) document by the FAA.This document is organized as follows: Section 1 of the document provides programmatic context, an overview of the ConOps document, and an overview of the proposed system.Section 2 of the document lists reference documents that relate to the PDRC initiative.Section 3 of the document describes the current system.Section 4 of the document provides justification for changing the current system, and a description of the proposed changes.Section 5 of the document describes the proposed system.Section 6 of the document details scenarios intended to demonstrate the operation of the proposed system and illustrate how the proposed system improves upon the current system.Section 7 of the document details operational and organization impacts associated with the new system.Section 8 of the document presents analyses conducted to quantify the benefits associated with implementing the proposed changes.It also presents those options considered and discarded.Section 9 of the document presents additional notes.Appendix A of the document describes other NextGen research and development initiatives that are related to PDRC.The Glossary at the end of the document presents a list of acronyms, and their definitions, that are used within the ConOps.The focal point for PDRC is the OFF event in Figure 1:2 where the red trajectory joins with the gold trajectory on the departure runway.The Tower decision support tool computes surface trajectories to this point to develop OFF time estimates.The Center decision support tool computes ascent trajectories from this point to the merge point in the overhead stream for tactical departure scheduling.

Current systemThe PDRC system addresses shortfalls in present-day tactical departure scheduling situations.This section defines tactical departure scheduling and describes how it is accomplished today in the NAS.
Background, objectives, and scopeTactical departure scheduling is a process used by Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) to regulate air traffic flow to eliminate local demand/capacity imbalances and meet requirements of local traffic management initiatives (TMIs).Tactical departure scheduling is not required during normal NAS operations, as the airspace into which the flight is being released generally has sufficient capacity to accommodate the departure.However, during periods of high demand or low capacity for the airspace being scheduled into, tactical departure scheduling may then be utilized.3.1.1Tactical versus strategic departure scheduling While a significant amount of literature exists on strategic departure scheduling in the NAS, information on the tactical departure scheduling process is quite limited.Thus, a NAS-wide analysis of departure scheduling operations [5] was first performed by the PDRC research team.Tactical and strategic departure scheduling processes are distinct from one another and are currently not directly integrated.Tactical departure scheduling is distinguished from strategic departure scheduling based upon scope (both temporal and geographic), precision requirements, and the decision support tools used [5].Strategic departure scheduling primarily uses the Traffic Flow Management (TFM) tool suite, while tactical departure scheduling is typically accomplished with the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) decision support tool [26].A significant difference between tactical and strategic departure scheduling is the scope of the initiative.Strategic departure scheduling is focused on correcting large demand/capacity imbalances that exist in the NAS, usually due to convective weather or high demand.This often requires significant delays over an extended period of time, which may be assigned hours in advance of the affected aircraft's departure time.In contrast, tactical departure scheduling focuses on a specific air traffic flow that is subject to a local traffic management initiative (like Miles in Trail or Adjacent Center Metering), and generally introduces small delays to specific aircraft on an as-needed basis.Tactical departure schedules are able to consider the latest airspace conditions minutes before takeoff.Tactical departure scheduling system delays are approximately 4 minutes per aircraft, on average, with a median of 1 minute.This delay is significantly lower than TFM delays, with approximately a 66 minute average and a 52 minute median delay.These statistics are derived from January 2011 NAS operational data [5].The study of January 2011 NAS operational data also examined the relative frequency of tactical and strategic departure scheduling.Figure 3:1 uses the large gray ellipse to depict the entire set of domestic flights in the NAS (more than 1 million) for that month.Departures subject to strategic traffic management initiatives are shown in the orange ellipse.Tactical departures are shown in the 3 green ellipses.There were approximately 3.5 times as many tactical departures as strategic departures in January 2011.The results shown in Figure 3:1 distinguish between inbound and outbound tactical departures.These two types of tactical departure scheduling are described in detail in Section 3.3.Inbound is associated with TMA arrival metering and outbound is associated with TMA's En Route Departure Capability (EDC) function.For this analysis, an aircraft was counted as being tactically scheduled only if the aircraft was both scheduled and 'accepted' or 'frozen' into the TMA Arrival or EDC system.A significant number of aircraft (approximately 18,489 during January, 2011) were initially scheduled in the TMA system, but the scheduling process was not finalized by either "accepting" or "freezing" it.This suggests an even larger pool of tactical departure operations may exist.It is worth noting that inbound tactical departure scheduling occurred about five times more frequently than outbound tactical departure scheduling in January 2011 operations.
Prevalence of tactical departure scheduling in the NASAnalysis of NAS operational data also provided insights into the prevalence of tactical departure scheduling.Reference 5 notes that TMA's EDC function is deployed to all 20 Centers.Data presented in Figure 4 of that paper indicate that EDC is commonly used for outbound tactical departure scheduling at about half of the Centers.As described in Reference 4, inbound tactical departure scheduling is largely dependent on TMA adjacent center metering infrastructure.The Centers conducting inbound tactical departure scheduling have been labeled with round yellow "O" and square orange "D" symbols.The "O" label indicates Centers that schedule their departures into the arrival TMA system of one or more adjacent Centers.The "D" label identifies Centers that permit adjacent facilities to schedule departures into their arrival TMA system.The one "O" label in the northeast that is not associated with a Center represents the inbound tactical departure scheduling from Nav Canada to New York Center (ZNY).Figure 3:2 shows that 18 Centers (plus Nav Canada) schedule departures into another Center's TMA system, while 10 Centers receive inbound tactical departure schedules from other facilities.
Operational policies and constraintsTactical departure scheduling is not required during normal NAS operations.It is predominantly used when tactical restrictions on the airspace have been imposed.A common TMI requires the use of the CFR procedure, also known as the Approval Request (APREQ) procedure.CFR procedures are used to address local demand/capacity imbalances and ensure local traffic management initiatives are satisfied.Note that the locally implemented CFR procedure may be in response to a constraint that is propagated from elsewhere in the NAS.CFR procedures vary from facility to facility; however, they generally require the Tower personnel to call the Center for a scheduled departure time, prior to releasing the aircraft for departure.The CFR procedure is applied to departing aircraft in order to ensure the demand placed on local airspace resources en route to or at the destination airport does not exceed the available capacity.The CFR procedure may be applied in both the outbound and inbound tactical departure scheduling modes.In a CFR scenario, it may or may not be necessary to delay the aircraft based upon the latest information available on the constrained flow at the time that an aircraft is ready to depart.The improved departure time compliance associated with the CFR procedure provides more accurate schedule predictions than are available via the aircraft's filed flight plan departure time (also known as Predicted Departure Time, or PTIME), or via Expect Departure Clearance Times (EDCTs).EDCTs are generated by TFM as a part of the strategic departure scheduling system and are not intended for tactical use.Aircraft PTIMEs represent a starting point from which the departure planning process can begin, but are historically prone to OFF time uncertainty [23,27].The required departure compliance window for CFR aircraft has also varied somewhat by facility.Many facilities, including ZFW and DFW, have employed a -2/+1 minute compliance window for CFR operations.A recent FAA Notice [39] has established the -2/+1 window as a national standard for TMA operations by amending FAA 7110.65 standing order to read "when CFR is in effect, release aircraft so they are airborne within a window that extends from 2 minutes prior and ends 1 minute after the assigned time, unless otherwise coordinated."The compliance window is biased to favor early departures because it is easier to slow an early departure to fit into a slot than it is to accelerate a late departure.
Description of the current systemAs noted above, the TMA decision support tool includes two distinct modes for tactical departure scheduling: inbound scheduling of departures into an arrival stream of a TMA-metered airport, and outbound scheduling of departures from an airport within the departure Center to a remote Center.Examples of inbound and outbound tactical departure scheduling situations are presented in the following subsections.These descriptions use real-world situations to illustrate how the tactical departure scheduling modes are implemented today.The examples feature ZFW and DFW because this is the locale for the initial PDRC field evaluations.However, these situations are representative of current tactical departure scheduling situations found throughout the NAS.
Inbound tactical departure scheduling capabilityInbound tactical departure scheduling uses the TMA arrival metering "internal departure" function to schedule departures into the inbound arrival streams of a TMA-metered airport.These inbound departures may originate from the TMA system's home Center, another Center, or even other countries (e.g., Canadian flights scheduled into New York Center's TMA system via the international TFM interface).Figure 3:3 shows an example of an inbound tactical departure scheduling situation.In this case, the green arrows show various traffic streams destined to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH).These streams pass through ZFW airspace and converge at the TORNN meter arc (73nm radial distance northwest from the RIICE fix), which is situated at the southern boundary of ZFW.In TMA terminology, the TORNN arc is an "outer metering arc."TMA distributes the delay an aircraft must absorb to various meter reference points (i.e., metering arcs and fixes) situated along the arrival path.Metering at the TORNN arc is actually performed by ZFW controllers prior to departure, using information provided by the ZHU TMA system via the adjacent center metering infrastructure.As part of the scheduling process, a release time is computed for the DFW departure and communicated to the Tower via the CFR procedure.Given that DFW resides within the IAH metering freeze horizon and there is limited airspace available to maneuver after departure prior to the outer meter arc, a high level of departure prediction accuracy is required.Note that not all inbound tactical departure scheduling is from an adjacent center.For instance, Indianapolis Center schedules into New York Center, although the two Centers do not share a boundary.Another unique case occurs when aircraft departing Canadian airspace are managed via CFR into New York Center airspace.
Outbound tactical departure scheduling capabilityOutbound tactical departure scheduling uses TMA's EDC function to tactically schedule flights departing from airports within the TMA system's home Center outbound into constrained enroute streams or airspace.Whether the flight's destination is in the adjacent Center or across the country, this situation is considered tactical because EDC is being used to address local demand/capacity imbalances and because scheduling is to a meter point in the home Center.The EDC system design re-uses a number of common components of the arrival TMA system, such as its adaptation data structure, route processing algorithms, and trajectory generation functions.While many of the core components of TMA have been leveraged to provide EDC capability, there are notable differences between arrival TMA and the EDC system.The EDC system serves a different traffic management objective than the arrival TMA system.EDC's focus is outbound tactical departures leaving from one or more of the airports within a Center that are destined to a remote Center facility.In contrast, the tactical departure scheduling capability in the arrival TMA system is only focused on aircraft that are scheduled into its metered airports.EDC is commonly used to assist in the application of miles in trail restrictions between facilities, especially when the airspace being scheduled into is highly constrained or has multiple miles in trail initiatives to satisfy.An additional use of EDC is to assist in regulating departures into sectors that are experiencing high demand.In contrast, arrival TMA use is primarily motivated by the traffic volume in the arrival streams entering the metered airport rather than by sector loading considerations.The DFW departures merge with the overhead stream at the MEI arc (155 nmi radial distance west from the MEI fix) located on the extreme eastern edge of ZFW.This arc serves as a meter reference point for TMA's EDC function.TMA EDC uses four-dimensional (4D) trajectory synthesis, including aircraft performance models and current forecast winds, to calculate an OFF time that will enable the aircraft to rendezvous with the identified slot at the meter point.The ATL flow shown here represents a fairly common CFR situation for ZFW.However, ZFW uses EDC for outbound tactical departure scheduling to Houston-area airports approximately four times more often than for ATL.
Clarifying inbound vs. outbound tactical departure schedulingThe inbound and outbound labels were coined to address confusion associated with the two distinct departure scheduling functions in TMA.The TMA EDC function is clearly identified as a departure capability; however, it is currently used about 5 times less frequently than arrival TMA's "internal departure" scheduling function.The situation is even more confusing when one considers that arrival TMA "internal departures" are now frequently external to the home Center with the widespread deployment of adjacent center metering.The inbound and outbound labels are referenced to the TMA system being used for departure scheduling.Thus, it is important to have a clear mental picture how TMA is used for tactical departure scheduling in the present-day NAS. Figure 3:5 depicts both inbound and outbound tactical departure scheduling applied to the same constrained overhead stream.Consider first the outbound tactical departure scenario.In this case traffic managers at the blue Center would use the blue TMA/EDC system to schedule CFR departures from the airport on the left into the constrained overhead stream.The traffic managers are using their own TMA/EDC system to schedule traffic outbound from their own Center.In this case, the constrained overhead flow happens to be an arrival stream for an airport in the adjacent Center, but it is treated like any other outbound flow for scheduling purposes.Now consider the inbound tactical departure scenario.In this case, the departure from the airport on the left is scheduled into the green TMA system, which is being used by the green Center to meter the arrival stream to the airport on the right.The CFR call and tactical departure scheduling action is most likely being performed by traffic managers in the blue Center using an interface to the green Center TMA system.Thus, the blue Center traffic managers are using the green Center TMA system to schedule traffic inbound to the airport on the right.The situation depicted in Figure 3:5 is a common occurrence.Consider the blue Center to be ZFW and the green Center to be ZHU with the arrival airport on the right being IAH.Some days ZHU will meter arrival flows to IAH and ZFW traffic managers will follow the inbound tactical departure scheduling process for those flow.On other days, ZHU will use a MIT restriction on the IAH flows and ZFW traffic managers will manage departures with the outbound process.
Current tactical departure scheduling processCurrent tactical departure scheduling procedures in place at DFW during a Call for Release restriction require increased communication/coordination between the controllers.The process is as follows:1. Center calls the Towers to notify of the Call For Release restriction.2. The Tower enters the restriction in the currently available coordination tool (e.g., Integrated Display System #5) 3. Tower TMC and/or other personnel (e.g., frontline manager) monitor all flights as they become ready for departure to determine if they are subject to the call for release restriction.4. When an aircraft subject to Call For Release becomes ready for departure, the TMC calls the Center and requests a release time.5. Center types the manually communicated time in their automation tool, which provides a departure time that incorporates any required delay to fit into the overhead stream.The resulting time is communicated back to the Tower TMC in the form of a Call For Release window.6. Tower evaluates the situation on the airport surface and determines if the Call For Release time can or cannot be met.If the TMC believes the time is feasible then it is communicated to local controller.If not, then a new time is negotiated between Center and the Tower.Any holding of the flight due to the CFR will occur in the departure queue or at the runway threshold.
Modes of operation for the current systemThe NASA PDRC-IADS research team has observed the FAA operational tactical departure scheduling system operating in the following modes:• Operational (i.e., operational system nominal use)• Maintenance (i.e., support string utilization)
User classes and other involved personnelThe scope of this ConOps is specifically limited to the field evaluation environment for the PDRC-IADS research activity (i.e., NTX, ZFW, D10, and DFW).FAA recipients of this ConOps should be able to extrapolate the comments to other operational environments.Users of the current system include• ZFW Center TMCs and STMCs • D10 TRACON TMCs and STMCs • DFW Tower TMCs, STMCs and FLMs
Support environmentThe NASA PDRC-IADS research team has observed the following support environment elements for the FAA operational tactical departure scheduling system:• ZFW TMA support string hardware in use • ZFW TMCs and STMCs testing new releases and modifying system configuration • ZFW, D10, and DFW TechOps personnel providing hardware support • ZFW AOS personnel providing adaptation support • WJHTC second level support personnel providing various support • TMA National Team providing oversight and support
Justification for and nature of changesThis section describes the shortcomings of present-day tactical departure scheduling operations and describes the desired changes.
Justification for changesThe underlying problem that motivates this research is that of an aircraft departing from the airport surface into a constrained flow, like that illustrated in Figure 4:1.The primary challenge associated with present-day tactical departure scheduling is that OFF time predictions used in this process are manually estimated and coordinated.The anticipated PDRC benefits include • Dynamic alerts providing advance notice when aircraft will be unable to meet scheduled OFF time due to changes in the surface traffic situation•• Reduced workload due to automatic computation of OFF time predictions and automatic communication between surface and en route automation systems Analysis of the current system's performance indicates that significant room for improvement exists by reducing departure time uncertainty and manual coordination.NAS-wide operational data analysis for January 2011[5] showed nearly 6,800 inbound tactically scheduled aircraft and more than 1,900 outbound tactically scheduled aircraft that are estimated to have missed the airspace slot they were scheduled into because of departure time prediction uncertainty.The effect to the NAS of a missed scheduled departure slot often leads directly to lost capacity, most notably in the case in which an aircraft is scheduled as frozen into an arrival TMA slot but does not meet its expected departure time window.Measuring the impact to the NAS of a missed departure slot is not straight forward, as some ability to recover the airspace resource exists, but generally at a cost.An additional shortfall of the current inbound system occurs when the tactical departure delays become very large.This situation may require Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) involvement.When high, tactically-assigned ground delay occurs in the NAS, the ATCSCC may choose to implement an Airspace Flow Program (AFP) to regulate the flow of aircraft into the destination airport, with the objective of reducing the TMA-assigned surface delays.The AFP scheduling scenario used for this purpose is unique in that it is designed to work in conjunction with the arrival TMA system; hence, it is called a TMA Flow Program (TFP).The objectives of a TFP are to pre-condition the arrival stream such that TMA can utilize available space in the stream for tactical departure scheduling purposes.The boundaries of the TFP are set to be roughly contiguous with the arrival metering system's freeze horizon and any airport with departures inside of this boundary are exempt from the program.Using a TFP, the TFM suite of tools assigns a ground delay to aircraft bound for the metered airport that are located outside of the red circle shown in Figure 4:2, while TMA assigns a tactical ground delay (and potentially airborne delay, depending on the TMC selection) for those aircraft bound to the metered airport located within the red circle [16].
Description of desired changesThe following changes were required for the PDRC field evaluations:
Priorities amongst changesEssential changes required to the system to enact the change in operations described are explained in detail in the program level requirements in the Technology Description document [2], as well as how the PDRC team met those requirements.Determining priorities amongst optional features is likely best left to FAA personnel that will implement these changes in their native systems (e.g., TBFM and TFDM).As an example, user interface improvements were lower priority to the PDRC research team than ensuring the core data interfaces and algorithms were properly functioning.However, the FAA may have a different priority amongst changes.
Changes considered but not includedThis section summarizes ideas that have been considered but not included in the PDRC system.A number of potential capabilities for PDRC were not pursued due to the emphasis on realizing near-term benefits.Other capabilities were not considered due to resource limitations or the relative immaturity of certain research areas.Some of the potential changes are already planned for implementation in PDRC follow-on research.Changes that could fit into the near-term scope of PDRC that were considered but not included were as follows:• Initiate a call for release from the TMA/EDC data that is being passed to the surface system rather than requiring the surface user to enter it manually• Re-evaluate the use of color coding of surface flight status on minutes-level precision now that seconds-level precision is in use• Allow for an APREQ and/or EDCT aircraft to be placed on the timeline at their scheduled time rather than un-delayed OFF time• Improve communication and setup of APREQs in the surface system to address situations where turboprops should be included (inbound scenario) versus situations where turboprops should be excluded (outbound scenario)• Handle 'flight stubbing' data from carrier so that these flights match filed flight plans• Pass along the route 10b information available to rTMA and process it within the surface system to allow for improved departure fix mapping• Limit the runways available for selection on the surface system to those in the current airport configuration• Allow more options for color coding aircraft on the surface display based upon flight characteristics (e.g., aircraft has APREQ)• Change aircraft symbol on surface display (FAA request)• Dynamically change an aircraft's data tag values as the flight progresses; for example, initially show the parking gate while parked, then switch to the estimated spot after OUT, then switch to the estimated RWY after entering the AMA, and then, after OFF, switch to the departure fix (FAA request)• Provide a "what if" capability that allows the user to adjust the state for an individual aircraft and then elect to either apply the new state or reset back to the saved state (FAA request)• Enable a "Bulk Move," a bulk aircraft runway swap capability.Aircraft destined for particular, multiple selectable, departure fixes could be selected in addition to a particular runway.For example using the D10 south gate, aircraft destined to be over NELYN, JASPA, ARDIA, could be moved while leaving DARTZ aircraft alone.These moves would be temporally selected.It was also suggested that when moving aircraft from one side to the other that default east/west runways be set (by flow direction) so as to further simplify the move.(FAA request)• Enable Drag and Drop.This enhancement, requested by a D10/DFW STMC, would make it possible to drag and drop aircraft on a timeline.This came up in the context of airport runway balancing using SDSS as a pre-departure planning tool.In addition, enable drag and drop on rTMA with surface data (FAA request)• Display TMA data on SDSS timelines; this is part of a general request to allow greater visibility of TMA's predictions in the overhead stream on the surface display• Enable airline interface 'daisy chain' ability• Improve PDRC's data feed robustness• Improve handling of an aircraft with both an APREQ and EDCT• Improve 'suspend' logic handling• Obtain and use cancellation indicator from airline interface (Note: already in secondary interface)• Improve handling of surface time updates while Center user is in the process of scheduling (FAA request)• Verify that multiple surface interfaces can be handled by rTMA• Update the rTMA status message for surface flights to be automatically removed when associated work is done (FAA request)• Improve filtering of surface flights panel (Shift-F4 panel)
Assumptions and constraintsThe following are assumptions used in the development of this Concept of Operations:• A surface system will exist in the National Airspace system that is capable of providing OFF time predictions and runway assignments to the en route system similar to those provided by SDSS in PDRC• An en route system will exist in the National Airspace System that is capable of receiving surface information and providing coordinated release times similar to those provided by the rTMA system in PDRC• The surface and en route system will have access to data inputs similar to those used in PDRC (e.g., gates assignments, surface surveillance, en route surveillance, weather, flight planning data)• The system used to automate coordination during CFR events must perform at least as well as (preferably better than) the current manual process in use today.Failure to do so could lead to local personnel refusing to utilize the automation.• Some ability for site-specific adaptation related to surface/en route automation will exist.The desire is to keep site specific adaptation to a minimum• Adequate training for changes proposed will be provided to end users
Concepts for the proposed systemThis section describes the PDRC system that has been developed to address shortfalls in presentday tactical departure scheduling.
Background, objectives, and scopeThe PDRC-IADS research activity combines the automated coordination demonstrated in previous research [13, 20, 21]with the use of surface trajectory-based OFF time predictions to improve en-route tactical departure scheduling during CFR procedures.PDRC-IADS background, objectives, and scope are presented in Section 1.
Operational policies and constraintsPer the statement in Section 1, the scope of this ConOps is specifically limited to the field evaluation environment for the PDRC-IADS research activity (i.e., NTX, ZFW, D10, and DFW).FAA recipients of this ConOps should be able to extrapolate the comments to other operational environments.The PDRC operational evaluations [3] were conducted within the standard CFR procedures followed by ZFW and DFW.In other words, the TMCs have not been asked to modify procedures other than to use the PDRC research system.The PDRC operational evaluations were conducted only in the ZFW outbound (i.e., TMA/EDC) tactical departure scheduling scenario.Operational evaluations of the inbound scenario were not possible due to challenges of using rTMA for operational arrival metering at ZHU. See Section 5.4 of the Final Report [3] for a discussion of inbound scenario field evaluation challenges.
Description of the proposed systemA high-level overview of the proposed system is provided in Section 1.4.That overview and the accompanying figure presented the double-headed arrow as the essence of PDRC.The arrow represents the automatic communication and coordination of OFF times between the en route tactical departure scheduling system and a trajectory-based surface automation system.
5.3.1 PDRC applied to tactical departure scheduling Section 3.3 provided examples of inbound and outbound tactical departure scheduling situations and described how TMA's departure scheduling functions were used in these situations.This section uses a revised version of Figure 3:5 to illustrate how PDRC is applied to tactical departure scheduling.Figure 5:1 shows a NextGen trajectory-based surface automation system communicating with the TMA systems via the PDRC double-headed arrow.As described in the Section 1.4 overview, the surface system delivers OFF time predictions and runway assignments to TMA to improve tactical departure scheduling.The double arrow is also used to automatically communicate the TMA-computed release time back to the surface system for use by the Tower controller team.As shown in Figure 5:1, PDRC has been developed for both the inbound and outbound cases.The prototype software supports both cases, although the operational evaluation only evaluated the outbound case.
PDRC prototype softwareThe PDRC research activity strives to be implementation neutral, meaning that the research results will be generally applicable, regardless of which specific surface or en-route tools are used.PDRC performance will, however, be affected by the prediction and scheduling accuracy of the component systems that are used.The PDRC Technology Description document [2] includes requirements for the two component systems as well as information exchange requirements.The prototype software used for development and evaluation may not reflect eventual implementation systems.A high-level overview of the prototype software used for the PDRC concept testing is illustrated in
Modes of operation for the proposed systemThe PDRC research prototype system has been operated in the following modes:• Production (i.e., operational field evaluation)• Training (i.e., on-the-job training for TMCs prior to field evaluation)• Degraded (e.g., single center Host data when multi-center unavailable)This ConOps considers both nominal and off-nominal modes of operation.
User classes and other involved personnelPer the statement in Section 1, the scope of this ConOps is specifically limited to the field evaluation environment for the PDRC-IADS research activity (i.e., NTX, ZFW, D10, and DFW).FAA recipients of this ConOps should be able to extrapolate the comments to other operational environments.Subject-matter expert participation in the PDRC operational evaluations has included traffic managers (TMCs and STMCs) at ZFW Center, D10 TRACON, and DFW Towers, as well as frontline managers (FLMs) at DFW. Test participants will be generically identified as TMCs in the discussion that follows.
Support environmentPer the statement in Section 1, the scope of this ConOps is specifically limited to the field evaluation environment for the PDRC-IADS research activity (i.e., NTX, ZFW, D10, and DFW).FAA recipients of this ConOps should be able to extrapolate the comments to other operational environments.The PDRC prototype system is entirely supported by the PDRC-IADS research team at the NASA North Texas (NTX) Research Station for the duration of the development and evaluation period.
Operational scenariosThe primary scenario for the PDRC Block 1 field evaluation is the Call for Release (CFR) traffic management procedure applied to DFW departures and implemented with the outbound tactical departure scheduling (i.e., TMA/EDC).
CFR procedure overviewThe CFR procedure is a collaborative effort between the Center traffic management unit responsible for meeting the overhead stream constraints and the Tower controllers responsible for releasing departing aircraft.The PDRC concept automates portions of this collaborative departure scheduling effort.Specifically, PDRC's SDSS component automatically predicts the earliest achievable OFF times for all departure flights.For flights subject to CFR restrictions, the SDSS OFF time predictions are automatically communicated to rTMA for use in tactical departure scheduling functions.The PDRC two-way interface facilitates inter-facility coordination required to establish an agreed upon release time.As described in Section 3.2, a recent FAA Notice [39] has established the -2/+1 CFR compliance window as a national standard for TMA operations by amending FAA 7110.65 standing order to read "when CFR is in effect, release aircraft so they are airborne within a window that extends from 2 minutes prior and ends 1 minute after the assigned time, unless otherwise coordinated."The compliance window is "biased" towards being early because it is easier to slow an early departure to fit into a slot than it is to accelerate a late departure.Tactical CFR precision requirements are significantly higher than for strategic TMIs [5].Even so, the three-minute window is rather imprecise when one considers that this equates to a 21 to 24 mile slot at the en route meter point.Rather than prescribe a window that the surface controller must meet, PDRC communicates the target time of departure at seconds-level granularity to the Traffic Manager in the tower.Communicating this time at seconds-level granularity removes any rounding of the data that would be done by the Center system or personnel, ensuring the exact target time is known by the traffic manager in the tower.PDRC also has the ability to adjust the time passed from the Center automation if necessary to bias the time to achieve the objective.The TMC then uses the electronically communicated time in seconds-level precision and rounds this value, as appropriate, before passing it along to the local controller.The local controller then works to meet the time as closely as possible with the understanding that it is better to be early than late.It should be noted that application of PDRC automation does not fundamentally alter the CFR procedure.Center and Tower roles and responsibilities may remain the same, and CFR operations may be conducted per existing inter-facility Letters of Agreement.TMA is widely used for tactical departure scheduling to meet CFR restrictions, and TMC interactions with the TMA departure scheduling functions are essentially unchanged with the PDRC system.Thus, only the SDSS-related portions of the following scenario represent material changes to the present-day CFR procedure.The tactical departure scheduling actions summarized in Figure 6:1 are described in detail in the following subsection.
CFR evaluation scenario stepsThis section details tactical departure scheduling with PDRC to implement the CFR traffic management procedure.The steps are illustrated with actual screenshots from Tower and Center displays taken during the Block 1 PDRC field evaluation.The PDRC scheduling event shown in these screenshots is for AAL1001 on 18 June 2012.This was a DFW departure joining an IAHbound stream with outbound tactical departure scheduling (i.e., TMA EDC scheduling) to the TNV meter arc, which is situated at the southern boundary of Fort Worth Center very near the TORNN arc shown in Figure 3:3.As shown in Figure 6:1, the actors in the PDRC operational concept scenario are (nominally) two TMCs.One TMC is located in the Center TMU and the other is located in the Tower.For simplicity, these TMCs are identified as Center and Tower in the following discussion.
CFR restriction notificationThe modified CFR notification process will continue to vary by facility.At ZFW, the Center will still notify the D10 TRACON, which, in turn, notifies each affected airport Tower that CFR restrictions have been implemented for a given destination and time range.Notifications are done via inter-facility voice calls.After the initial notification via D10 TRACON, an individual Tower usually communicates directly with the Center when making CFR requests, but multiple towers may coordinate through D10.Both ZFW and D10 will continue to enter the CFR restrictions in their electronic logging systems.
CFR activation in SDSSIn response to receiving notification of a CFR restriction, the Tower will use the SDSS "Add/Remove APREQ Schedule" dialog to enter a new CFR.The CFR will include the destination airport or jet route and the time range that is used to determine which flights are subject to the CFR restriction.Flights subject to the CFR restriction are entered into a list used by rTMA and SDSS to track the flights being actively coordinated.The results of CFR activation in SDSS for the AAL1001 example are shown in Figure 6:2.The timeline data tag for this flight has been colored white with an APREQ label and APREQ appears for AAL1001 in the flights table.
Request for Release Time (RFRT)As an affected flight becomes ready for departure, the Tower will select "Request Release Time" from the SDSS "Flight Properties" menu (accessed for a specific flight from the timeline or flights table).This causes SDSS to send a Request For Release Time (RFRT) to rTMA.The request will include time projections for both Undelayed Coordinated OFF Times (UCOT) and Predicted Coordinated OFF Times (PCOT) times.The undelayed time represents when the flight could be at the runway assuming no other traffic on the surface, while the predicted time incorporates constraints imposed by other aircraft.The flight's PDRC status is updated, and an indication is provided to the Tower on both the timeline and the flights table that the release time has been "Requested."The Center also receives a "Release Requested" indicator on the rTMA display as well as an audible alert.The SDSS screenshot in Figure 6:2 was captured at 21:14:37 just as the Tower was selecting "Request Release Time" for AAL1001.The PDRC predicted OFF time (i.e., PCOT) is shown in the flights table to be 21:19:31.The surface situation display shows that AAL1001 was just beyond the spot when Tower requested the release time.The results of the Request Release Time entry are shown in Figure 6:3, which is an SDSS screen shot taken a few seconds after the one in Figure 6:2.The timeline data tag and flights table entry for AAL1001 have been updated to indicate a pending release time request.The figure also shows that the PDRC predicted OFF time is continuously updated -the flights table PCOT value for AAL1001 is now 21:19:32.This PCOT value was communicated to rTMA along with the release time request.Figure 6:3 also illustrates a motivation for using trajectory-based OFF time predictions from a surface management system for tactical departure scheduling.AAL1001 is scheduled to depart from runway 17R on the east side of DFW.At the time of this screenshot, the 17R departure queue is completely empty, and the taxiway from AAL1001's position to the departure is also vacant.However, the screenshot shows a train of three American Eagle flights currently headed to runway 17R along the northernmost bridge (Taxiway Z).In the manual CFR scenario, the Tower would have to mentally compute ETAs to the 17R hold pad from these flights on the bridge and estimate the departure queue sequence before providing the Center with a predicted OFF time for AAL1001.Experienced Tower personnel are adept at these predictions, but the extra workload can be eliminated through use of a trajectory-based surface management system.
Response to the Request for Release Time (RFRT)The Center will respond to RFRT requests using rTMA's "Schedule a Departure" dialog, which has been enhanced to display SDSS scheduling information.The Center will select one of the following actions:• SCHEDULE USING SURFACE TIME, which causes rTMA to schedule the flight for departure at the earliest time that is equal to, or later than, the predicted OFF time.If the Center FREEZES or ACCEPTS the Suggested Departure Time via the dialog, or manually schedules via timeline actions, then rTMA forwards the Scheduled Departure Time (SDT) to SDSS.At that point, the flight will be assigned a PDRC status of "SDT SENT." • SCHEDULE USING HOST TIME, which allows the TMC to over-ride the surface provided OFF time in favor of the 'now time' or PTIME default that is adapted in TMA.This will also allow the TMC to write in free form text any time they choose.• FREE RELEASE, which tells the Tower that the flight may be released at their discretion.Center.Fort Worth Center is seeking to satisfy the MIT restriction for this stream at the TNV arc near the boundary between the Centers.The middle timeline is referenced to the TNV arc.This timeline represents the constrained overhead stream for this example of the PDRC operational scenario.The far left timeline in Figure 6:4 shows departures from various airports that Fort Worth Center must merge into the constrained IAH-bound stream.The CFR procedure has been implemented to manage these departures.This timeline is referenced to the runway OFF point for each of the various airports.AAL1001 is shown at approximately 21:34 on the left side of the middle timeline.This is the time that rTMA estimates AAL1001 could arrive at the TNV arc without consideration for other traffic.This ETA is based on rTMA trajectory-based computations that begin with the SDSSprovided OFF time prediction.One can see that AAL1001 directly competes with UAL1258, which is currently airborne (indicated by leader line and data tag with the same color).On the far left timeline AAL1001 is shown with a white data tag indicating that the Tower has requested a release time via PDRC.The blue "delay" value shown to the left of the AAL1001 data tag provides the Center with an indication of unassigned surface delay that this flight is expected to experience due to surface congestion.This value is the difference between PDRC's PCOT and UCOT OFF time predictions.UCOT is computed without consideration of other surface traffic while PCOT accounts for other surface traffic.The rTMA TGUI screenshot in Figure 6:5 was taken 11 seconds after the screenshot in   This completes the Center's response to the Tower's request for release time.6.2.5 Response to Scheduled Departure Time (SDT) When a Scheduled Departure Time (SDT) is sent to SDSS, the Tower determines if the rTMAsupplied SDT is acceptable, and will select one of the following actions:• SDT is acceptable, which will prompt notification to the Center and an update of the flight's PDRC status to "SDT ACCEPTED."On the SDSS display, this will cause the timeline data block text to include "APRQ:hh:mm:ss," where the "hh" is the hour of the release, "mm" is the minute, and "ss" is the seconds.The data block highlighting will indicate whether the flight's current predicted OFF Time is before, after, or within a configurable tolerance of the SDT.• SDT is not acceptable, which will prompt notification to the Center and an update of the flight's PDRC status to "SDT REJECTED."In this case, the Tower and Center generally resolve the situation via voice communications, however a number of automated options exist to resolve this electronically within PDRC.After this Tower TMCs suggested that explicit acceptance was superfluous.The subject was discussed at a field evaluation "how goes it" meeting and Center and Tower personnel agreed that this step would be optional.Acceptance of the SDT delivered by rTMA is now implied unless the SDT is explicitly rejected.The SDSS screenshot shown in Figure 6:8 was taken a few seconds after the rTMA screenshot shown in Figure 6:7and slightly more than a minute after the Tower requested a release time for AAL1001.Figure 6:8 shows that AAL1001 is now proceeding north along taxiway L to runway 17R.The SDT computed by rTMA and delivered via the PDRC interface is shown in both the timeline data tag and the flights table.The SDT is displayed with seconds-level precision: 21:21:02.The timeline data tag is highlighted in yellow indicating that AAL1001 must be delayed two minutes to meet the SDT.As described above, the Tower has the option of explicitly accepting the SDT via a right click on the timeline data tag.This acceptance would alter the data tag highlight and send a message back to rTMA.
Departure release managementTower traffic control tactics for CFR flights are determined by the Center's response to the RFRT:• If a Free Release has been sent from rTMA to SDSS, then the flight's timeline tag reverts to normal text display and "APRQ:FREE" is displayed in the tag.The Tower can then manage that flight's departure as if no CFR restriction were in place.• If a SDT has been provided and accepted, then the Tower performs tasks to meet the rTMA SDT.These may include: flight strip marking and manipulation procedures; ATC control of aircraft surface movements, arrivals, and departures; and monitoring SDSS's continuously updated projections of departure time estimates.Note that, at any time, rTMA can cancel a RFRT for a particular aircraft via a message to SDSS.This will cause SDSS to also cancel the request in a message to rTMA and return the flight to the initial state of "APRQ."The user may then initiate a new request.Note also that at any time after a "Request Departure Time" has been initiated, the user may cancel the request.This will cause SDSS to send a request cancelation message to rTMA and return the flight to the initial state of "APRQ."The SDSS screenshot in Figure 6:9 was taken one minute before the scheduled departure time for AAL1001.The aircraft target can be seen in the runway 17R departure queue.AAL1001 is next for departure behind EGF3383, which is currently at the 17R threshold.Green highlighting for AAL1001's timeline data tag indicates the flight is on track to meet the scheduled departure time.Near the top of the timeline in Figure 6:9 the data tag for SKW5169 is colored white with an "APRQ" label indicating to the Tower that this is the next flight subject to the CFR procedure.
Merge into overheadThe final step in the tactical departure scheduling scenario involves the merge into the overhead stream.This step differs between the inbound and outbound case.For the inbound case, scheduled time of arrival and sequence information regarding the merge is communicated to the Center sector controller via TMA arrival metering functions.The outbound tactical departure scheduling case currently operates in an open loop fashion with no information from TMA EDC being communicated to the Center sector controller.For the outbound case, Center TMCs carefully monitor the overhead stream merges to identify any traffic management adjustments that may be required given current traffic conditions.In a similar manner, monitoring of the overhead stream merge is an important performance measure for the PDRC field evaluation.Figure 6:10 shows a screenshot of the rTMA Planview Graphical User Interface (pGUI) as AAL1001 merged into the IAH-bound overhead stream at the TNV meter arc.DFW airport is shown near the top of the screenshot.AAL1001 exited D10 TRACON at the DARTZ fix shown near the middle of the diagram.As noted in Section 6.2.4,rTMA assigned AAL1001 a two-minute surface delay to resolve a slot contention situation with UAL1258. Figure 6:10 shows AAL1001 crossing the TNV arc immediately behind UAL1258 as scheduled by rTMA.
Summary of impactsThe following sections discuss the operational impacts of this change to system users.
Operational impactsThe change in controller procedures is seen as minimal.The most significant change to current operations is incorporating greater precision OFF times into the Tower local controller's workflow.The local controller role is known for having a 'rhythm' and during the PDRC evaluations there was some concern that a highly precise target OFF time might affect this rhythm.DFW STMCs prepared briefings on PDRC evaluation procedures presented to all DFW Tower controllers.Feedback from the DFW STMCs and TMCs throughout the two operational evaluations indicated that these educational efforts were mostly effective, although some refresher briefings were required.Another procedural change was that phone calls were no longer received by the ZFW Center TMU to request for release times.Instead, the Center TMU asked for an audible alert when the request for release time arrived from the surface system.The same audible alert option was available to DFW Tower personnel for notification of any/all Center events, but they did not feel it was needed at this time.
Organizational impactsTraining of system users on the electronic request and scheduling will be required.PDRC benefited from the fact that the changes to the Center interface were minimal given the decision to utilize rTMA from the FAA's TMA/EDC system.Even so, training was required to note all the differences between TMA and rTMA.The SDSS decision support tool was new to DFW, so more extensive training was required for the Tower TMCs.Tower TMCs also had to be trained on communication of target times to the local controllers as described in the preceding section.
Impacts during developmentThe inbound case described earlier in this document has the potential to impact systems outside the target facility's system boundary.For instance, departures being released from DFW into a metered arrival flow into IAH would require a receiving TMA system in ZHU.Given that some testing of this remote center interface would be necessary prior to production use, and that the resulting times would be displayed on operational controllers' scopes, as they are today for manually input times, this requires multi-center coordination.equipped satellite airports scheduling into the overhead stream.This led Center personnel to request seconds-level precision for manual communication to non-surface automation airports.It also caused some challenges for the Center due to the less-equipped satellite airports adhering to a three minute window while DFW achieved a much higher OFF time compliance than was possible without PDRC.
Alternatives and trade-offs consideredOperational alternatives considered during the PDRC evaluation were as follows:• Use of a TMA/EDC timeline in the tower.This was considered due to the desire to allow greater visibility into the overhead stream for tower personnel.However, after better understanding of the complexities of configuring the EDC system for a particular flow and the training difficulties associated with that, other options were pursued.• Pre-departure conditioning view of surface.A number of alternatives were considered with regard to configuring the surface timeline display to make it useful for the TMC in his/her everyday work on the airport surface.This entailed a number of GUI changes and evaluating a number of options with the TMC in order to arrive at a display that is now called 'pre-departure conditioning.'This name reflects the TMC use of the surface display to perform pre-tactical loading of the runway via assigning aircraft from specific departure fixes to one side or the other of the airport.• Auto-scheduling.The ability to automatically assign and accept release requests from a surface system was implemented in the PDRC system.However, the Center users felt that this would not lessen their workload unless D10 TRACON also took over all other D10 departures in addition to DFW departures.Therefore, this system option has not been fully explored to this point during the PDRC evaluations.• Center system or Surface system the primary server.PDRC began with the Center system as the primary server of data and the surface system attaching to it later.Over time the architecture changed so that the surface system was the server with the Center system attaching to it.This seemed more natural to the developers working closely with the data.There are no known operational impacts to this architecture change although the expected start/stop and uptimes of each system will need to be evaluated as the capability is deployed into the NAS.Today, the TMA system can run many days without restarting.Restarts in TMA are generally only done when a new adaptation or new system software needs to be loaded.The restart policy of the future surface system was unknown during PDRC development.• Drag and drop for Surface times on TMA.Drag and drop capability is an option available for scheduling departures in TMA/EDC today in the NAS.However, use of this capability for an aircraft with a surface time would mean that the user is over-riding the surface provided time.Consequently, in the PDRC implementation it was decided that this capability would not be available.After user feedback on the subject it has become apparent that this is a desired feature.• Seconds-level precision on the TMA scheduling graphical interface.Center personnel requested seconds-level precision on the Schedule a Departure Dialog (SADD) panel.Today the SADD panel always truncates the value to minutes-level granularity.However, this variable could not be changed without impacting several areas of the source code and due to available resources this change was not made to TMA.• Route 10B information passed to the surface system.TMA has logic that considers and applies changes to the flight's expected route using flight plan information from the 10B field of the NAS flight plan.This information would be useful in the surface system in order to properly assign departure fixes.The PDRC system would have benefited from this information, resulting in fewer departure fix mismatches.• Activating a Call For Release electronically from the TGUI.The only phone call that still remained in PDRC was to initialize the CFR.This too could be removed by allowing the TGUI to create and send this constraint electronically.A reasonable place to add this constraint may be on the same panel that is used to assign Miles in Trail.• Drag and drop on surface timeline.The ability to drag and drop a flight from one time to another on the surface timeline was requested by Tower personnel at DFW.This was not implemented due to resource constraints.This section addresses the IDAC concept, while the following section addresses the DFM prototype.The objective of IDAC is to increase NAS efficiency and reduce delays by providing decisionmaking support capabilities for departure flows.IDAC automates the process of monitoring departure demand and identifying departure slots.IDAC coordinates the departure times between airports and provides situational awareness to Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCT) so that they can select from available departure times in their planning.IDAC seeks to leverage and build upon the best of the available FAA departure scheduling systems.Relationship to PDRC: As described in Section A.3, the PDRC RTP is intended to support TBFM's development and implementation of IDAC.
A.5 Departure Flow Management (DFM) prototypeThe DFM prototype has been evaluated in field trials at several FAA facilities.Evaluation results are presented in Reference 13, which includes the following description of DFM:Departure Flow Management (DFM) is a capability seeking to increase departure flow efficiency by automating the coordination of departures from multiple airports over shared and congested NAS resources via improved decision support capabilities and web-based, electronic communications.Traffic managers in the Center monitor departure and en route demand, initiate DFM departure procedures, and monitor the traffic flow.DFM allocates departure times to the affected airports, and traffic managers at the airports assign these times to the departures at their facilities.Compared to the current APREQ process, the automated calculation, communication, and assignment of departure times reduce workload and increase departure flow efficiency.The DFM concept builds upon previous NASA research into automation of the APREQ process [20].The DFM prototype, developed by Metron Aviation, was based upon a subset of DFM concept requirements that originated from the FAA's Departure Flow Management Workgroup.The goal of the initial operational capability of the Departure Flow Management (DFM) system was to satisfy the following principal functions:• Allow Center TMCs to electronically submit DFM TMIs • Automatically calculate available release times to satisfy TMIs • Allow Tower controllers to electronically assign release times • Provide a communication protocol to support the automated communication processThe general concept of the DFM System is outlined as follows (Note: The language below is taken directly from the DFM requirements document [36]):1.The DFM System receives flow evaluation area and flight data from ETMS 2. The Center TMC enters TMIs into DFM 3. DFM identifies all gaps and release times in the restricted flows 4. The Center TMC makes and approves release time assignments, and monitors the integrity of the flows

Analysis of the proposed systemThe PDRC research activity will assess the value of using surface trajectory-based OFF time predictions and runway assignments to compute en route departure schedules during Call For Release situations.As the research progresses, results will be documented in this section.Please refer to Section 4 for a summary of the anticipated benefits.
Summary of improvementsNASA conducted two operational evaluations of PDRC.The evaluations were based at NASA's NTX Research Station and involved TMCs and FLMs at Fort Worth Center and DFW's East and West Towers.Complete evaluation results are provided in the PDRC Final Report [3].Specific improvements noted the PDRC operational evaluation include the following:• The evaluations ran for a total of 29 weeks in 2012 and early 2013.During these evaluations more than 230 flights were scheduled with the PDRC prototype.Positive subject-matter expert feedback was received throughout the evaluation and significant improvements in tactical departure OFF time compliance were demonstrated.• OFF time compliance (OTC) is defined as the error between the actual OFF time and the coordinated release time agreed to by the Center and Tower TMCs.OTC results from the two PDRC evaluations were compared against a year-long sample of baseline data.Since the goal is to reduce uncertainty, key OTC metrics are the standard deviation and the absolute average error.PDRC showed a 43% improvement over the baseline standard deviation and a 43% improvement in absolute average error.• A key feature of the PDRC concept is coordination and communication based on a single target release time rather than a release window.The PDRC target time (with secondslevel resolution) is used throughout the process and a single time (with appropriate rounding) is communicated by the Tower TMC/FLM to the local controller.When comparing PDRC evaluation results against a present-day standard -2/+1 OFF time compliance window we find that 54% of the baseline flights met the -2/+1 window (note that outliers were removed from the baseline data set).PDRC Block 1 data exhibited 74% compliance against the standard window while Block 2 had 83% compliance.By this performance measure, PDRC Block 2 exhibited approximately 53% improvement over baseline compliance with the standard window.• Leveraged surface-provided runway assignments along with more detailed TRACON routing to improve en route departure prediction to TRACON departure fix.These improvements reduced average TRACON time-to-fly prediction errors by up to a factor of 6 (i.e., average errors of 176 seconds reduced to 28 seconds) depending on departure runway and departure fix combination.
Disadvantages and limitationsA remaining challenge with surface/en route automation is determining how the processes and procedures will differ for equipped sites that have surface automation, versus lesser equipped sites that do not.During the PDRC evaluation the EDC system was used for both DFW and non-

Appendix A: Related NextGen InitiativesThis appendix discusses NextGen initiatives that are related to the PDRC-IADS research activity.A.1 Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface Concept The FAA NextGen organization is leading an effort to refine the concept [28] and functional requirements [29] for Integrated Arrival, Departure, and Surface (IADS) operations.The IADS concept is a collection of integrated capabilities designed to assist the air navigation service provider, user community, and other stakeholders to efficiently plan for and execute the movement of aircraft into and out of congested terminal environments to optimize the use of all arrival, departure, and surface capacity.This concept description focuses on how these currently separate and independent capabilities will be integrated to operate in a synergistic manner.Relationship to PDRC: PDRC seeks to contribute to the development of this concept by addressing a portion of the research gaps [30] identified by the FAA NextGen organization.
A.2Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) The FAA Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) Program is conducting concept engineering and requirements analyses to support procurement of a Tower automation system that implements the TFDM concept [32].
Relationship to PDRC:The NASA/FAA IADS RTT has identified the TFDM program as one recipient of the PDRC research transition product (RTP).The TBFM and TFDM Programs will use these products to inform development of the Integrated Departure Arrival Capability (IDAC), which features linkages between the TBFM and TFDM automation systems.The PDRC RTP will be used in TFDM's Core Work Package.
A.3 Time Based Flow Management (TBFM)The FAA Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) Program provides for continued support and development of the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) decision support tool.
Relationship to PDRC:The NASA/FAA IADS RTT has identified the TBFM program as one recipient of the PDRC research transition product (RTP).The TBFM and TFDM Programs will use these products to inform development of the Integrated Departure Arrival Capability (IDAC), which features linkages between the TBFM and TFDM automation systems.The PDRC RTP will be used in TBFM's Work Package #3.
A.4Integrated Departure Arrival Capability (IDAC) The IDAC concept was formerly known as the Departure Flow Management (DFM) concept.This can lead to confusion with the recent DFM prototype demonstration and evaluation activity.
The Tower controller identifies restricted flights and makes release timeassignments and requests for those flights 6.The system logs data for post analysis 7. The Help Desk technician supports Center and Tower users of DFM 8.The System Administrator user monitors the health of the system and troubleshoots any problems Relationship to PDRC: As indicated by item 3 above, DFM calculates release times for an aircraft in the restricted flows it is managing.However, like the TMA/EDC, DFM has no knowledge of the surface situation upon which to base OFF time estimates.PDRC is intended to complement the DFM prototype by demonstrating the value of surface trajectory-based OFF time predictions and runway assignments for en route tactical departure scheduling.
A.6 Surface Collaborative Decision Making (Surface CDM)The Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) organization has established a working group to develop concepts and requirements for Surface CDM [34].The Surface CDM activity is being supported by the FAA's Surface Office.The Surface CDM working group includes representatives from the FAA, air carriers and airport operators.
Relationship to PDRC:The PDRC-IADS research activity is identifying requirements for twoway communications between air carrier systems and the surface and en route components of the PDRC concept.The PDRC-IADS research team intends to coordinate with the Surface CDM working group to harmonize the concepts and requirements as they continue to be developed.
A.7 Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM)Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM) is one of the capabilities envisioned by the FAA's STBO [31] and TFDM [32] concept of operations.CDQM is a technique to manage the length of departure queues at each runway of an airport by metering entrance into the airport movement area during times when departure demand exceeds available capacity.This metering is accomplished by allocating a "fair share" of the available departure capacity to each flight operator based on anticipated demand during a specified interval.In addition to equitable capacity allocation among flight operators, there is also equitable distribution of delay.In CDQM, aircraft experience minimal physical queuing while surface movement management ensures the runway is fully used.Delay can be taken at the gate with engines running.Relationship to PDRC: PDRC does not directly involve surface traffic management.PDRC is narrowly focused on developing a methodology for and demonstrating the benefits of automatic communication of trajectory-based OFF time predictions and departure schedules between surface and departure management systems.PDRC research products will inform the development of advanced surface management capabilities like CDQM.

		(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Current study was quantitative in nature. All elementary level enrolled students at government schools in the province of the Punjab made the population of the study. Multistage sampling was used to select the sample from four districts of one division (Sargodha) of the Punjab province i.e., Sargodha. A sample size i.e., n=960; students and their parents were participated in this study. Research scales i.e. Parenting Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) was adapted to analyze and measure parents’ parenting styles and an achievement test was developed to measure the academic achievement of the elementary students. After pilot testing, reliability coefficient Cronbach Alpha values for PSDQ and achievement test were 0.67 and 0.71 Data was collected and analyzed using frequencies count, percentages, mean scores and one way ANOVA. Major findings of the study were; Majority of the parents had authoritative parental style, a handsome number of parents keep connection of warmth and support with their children, show intimacy, focus on discipline, do not grant autonomy to their children, do not indulge with their children and as well as a handsome number of students were confident during their studies and study, further, found that parental style had positive relationship with academic achievement. Recommendations were made on the basis of findings and conclusion such as arrangement of Parents Teachers Meetings (PTM‘s), parents’ training, provision of incentives and facilities to motivate families might be an inclusive component of elementary education program.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

These exciting advances have given rise to a new field of study within linguistics, termed Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL). This paper aims to fill the gap of MALL research in the area of grammar teaching in the Pakistan. Two BS Part 1 classes from University of Sindh, Jamshoro, were chosen for this quasi-experimental study. In total, 62 out of 101 students volunteered to use the Hello English application for 2 months, making up the experiment group, and the remaining 39 students were put in a control group.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country.

Making and implementing SNC is not only focusing the education of normal pupils, but also focusing students with disabilities (SWD). The field of special education experienced an increased discussion of curriculum for students with intellectual disabilities (SID). The present research aimed to know the benefits to implement first stage of single national curriculum for students with Intellectual disability and to know the differences about the benefits between public and private schools regarding SNC for students with ID based on demographic characteristics. Likert type researchers-made questionnaire with reliability) Cronbach alpha .922) was used. 90 special educationists from public and private schools were chosen through random sampling technique. The findings raised some benefits such as: SNC will bridge the social and economic disparities which will increase the acceptance of ID students. It was recommended that SNC should include areas of adaptive skills, motor, and vocational skills to get involved in work activities.

There had been many crematoriums in the city but with the passage of time, one after another, disappeared from the land after partition of the Sub-continent. Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city. The community remained deprived of a place to dispose of a dead body according to their faith for a long period which is contravention with the guidelines of the Quaid-e-Azam, founder of the nation Keyswords: Crematorium, Graveyard, Hindu community, Last Rituals Pages: 704-713 Article: 57 , Volume 2 , Issue 4 DOI Number: 10.47205/jdss.2021(2-IV)57 DOI Link: http://doi.org/10.47205/jdss.2021(2-IV)57 Download Pdf: download pdf view article Creative Commons License Estimating Growth Model by Non-Nested Encompassing: A Cross Country Analysis Authors: Benish Rashid Dr. Shahid Razzaque Dr. Atiq ur Rehman Abstract: Whether models are nested or non-nested it is important to be able to compare them and evaluate their comparative results. In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights. General people’s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
