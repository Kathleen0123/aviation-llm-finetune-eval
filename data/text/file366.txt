The Need for Dynamic DensityOne of the core elements of future concepts such as dynamic airspace configuration and advanced traffic flow management is the ability to measure and predict complexity.In an operational setting, changes in traffic flows and airspace will be better managed, both strategically and tactically, if an accurate measurement and prediction of complexity for a particular airspace is available.Additionally, higher levels of automation are proposed for future operations.Should automation degrade and if the design calls for a human operator to manage the situations, the measures of complexity are crucial so that human workload limitations are not exceeded.Complexity measures could be used to determine the areas where airspace design changes may be necessary.Airspace can be redesigned and examined to ensure that the complexity of the redesigned airspace is same or lower than its previous level.Often when researchers create scenarios for concept or procedural examinations, they need multiple scenarios of similar complexity but not the same scenarios to avoid learning effects.The complexity measures could be used as a yardstick to compare multiple scenarios.From the research perspective, the use of a DD metric in fast-time simulation models would provide a dynamic indicator of sector capacity and possibly workload.Most current fast-time models use the Monitor Alert Parameter (MAP) as a sector capacity indicator [6].A problem with using the MAP values is that they are usually generated by the facility that controls the sector and are not based on objective measures [7].Although these values can be adjusted dynamically, there is no scientific basis for doing so.A more objective measure would be a DD metric based on the current traffic situation and not on a static MAP value.This would provide a better way to represent potential workload and the ability to dynamically reroute aircraft around saturated airspace.A number of researchers have studied the topic of air traffic control complexity measurement (Mogford et al., 1995 [2]; Laudeman et al., 1999 [8]; Sridhar et al., 2000 [9]; Chatterji & Sridhar, 2001 [3]; Masolonis, 2003 [10]; Flynn et al., 2006 [11]; Manning & Pfleiderer, 2006 [12]).These earlier efforts largely concentrated on identifying the quantifiable complexity variables, based on the factors that contribute controller workload, using simulation exercises and controller feedback.Their main findings included a battery of complexity measures.However, they were not validated using field data.Therefore, the largest field data collection and validation exercise for complexity measurement and prediction was conducted 1999-2002 by the authors.Researchers collected over 6400 complexity ratings from controllers and supervisors at four US en route facilities.The study included the review of 72 thirty-minute traffic samples from a total of 36 high and low sectors.The study included most of the previously identified complexity variables and some additional variables identified by the authors.Researchers conducted an extensive metric development and validation activity with this set of data, which was presented at the 5 th USA/Europe ATM 2003 Research and Development (R&D) Seminar [4].They found that the combination of multiple complexity variables developed by various researchers worked the best in representing the controller workload.
Motivation for Current StudyThe motivation for the current study was threefold.First, the previous data collection and validation effort, that was reported at the 5 th USA/Europe ATM2003 R&D Seminar, was performed prior to the implementation of Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM).Some argue that RVSM procedures may impact the complexity of operations as more altitudes are available for conflict resolution and for setting up traffic flows.Hence, it was thought that some complexity factors might change.Therefore, the incorporation of RVSM procedures into a DD study seemed necessary.Second, the DD metric performed differently at different Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) in the previous study.It performed the least well for Cleveland Center's airspace of the four facilities in the sample.Therefore a specific focus on Cleveland airspace was warranted.And third, in the previous study, controllers and supervisors observed playbacks of traffic scenarios and provided complexity ratings.The researchers recognized the limitations of this approach and had always planned for another study where controllers would actively control traffic in a real-time simulation environment.In essence, this study could be considered a further validation of the initial study reported in ATM 2003 Seminar.
Description of DD MetricsIn 1999, the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC), NASA Ames Research Center, and Metron Aviation formed a partnership to research DD.Each organization had its own ideas about what variables contributed to DD, although many similarities existed.The analysis therefore considered all of the proposed variables.A unified DD model (i.e., one containing variables from each organization) performed the best.For the present study, NASA and the FAA collaborated once again to evaluate the same candidate DD variables that were considered in the previous analysis.This time, however, they used data collected from en route air traffic controllers working live traffic in a simulated environment to establish a more accurate and representative DD model.A high level description of the proposed variables is provided in the following sections.For detailed formulas, computations, and descriptions of all the metrics, please refer to a review article by Kopardekar [13].
WJHTC Metric
NASA Metric 1The NASA-1 metric consisted of 16 variables, which are listed in Table 2.For details of the calculations, readers should refer to Chatterji [3].
NASA Metric 2The NASA-2 metric consisted of 8 variables, which are listed in Table 3
Metron Aviation MetricThe Metron metric consisted of 10 variables, listed in Table 4
WASPThe squared difference between the heading of each aircraft in a sector and the direction of the major axis of the sector, weighted by the sector aspect ratio.
Table 4. Metron Aviation VariablesTable 5 lists 9 additional variables that were used in the study.These variables correspond to some of the original candidate metrics, but were computed differently.The TGF at the WJHTC is in the process of documenting these calculations.
MethodThe metrics developed by the FAA WJHTC / Titan Systems, NASA Ames Research Center, and Metron Aviation were evaluated in this study.This was the second validation exercise that examined all of the DD metrics using the same common data set to identify their applicability, strengths, andThe DD research activities associated with the current study were performed in three steps.The first step was a data collection effort.It involved selecting traffic samples from actual facility operations, generating simulation scenarios, and collecting subjective ratings from controllers on the complexity of those traffic samples in a simulated air traffic control environment.The second step involved the programming of all the candidate DD variables into the Target Generation Facility (TGF) Data Reduction and Analysis Tool, located at the WJHTC, and the generation of DD output/values based on the simulation data.The third step focused on data analysis and development of an optimal DD metric.This included a comparison of the DD output to the complexity ratings, and a regression analysis to determine the significant DD metric variables.
Step 1 -Complexity Rating Data Collection
ParticipantsDuring the first step of the DD study, researchers collected System Analysis Recording (SAR) data from Cleveland ARTCC to generate the simulation scenarios.This data source differed from the original study, which used the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) as the data source.For the human-in-the-loop simulation, six Certified Professional Controllers (CPCs) and 1 Operations Supervisor from Cleveland ARTCC served as participants.The CPCs had, on average, 18 years experience controlling traffic at many facilities, and approximately 12 years experience controlling traffic at Cleveland ARTCC.Fourteen simulation pilots and 4 ghost controllers also participated in the simulation.
ScenariosThe researchers gathered operational traffic data from 3 sectors in 3 areas at Cleveland ARTCC to develop traffic scenarios for the simulation data collection.Table 6 details the sector characteristics, including whether the sector was high or low, and its Monitor Alert Parameter (MAP), or aircraft count threshold.Four traffic scenarios, approximately 75minutes in length, were developed from the SAR data.Additional traffic was added to the scenarios to ensure levels were 1) high enough to capture a range of complexity and 2) busy across sectors (i.e., not too concentrated in one sector over another).A fifth scenario was also developed that contained off-nominal routing due to weather.
Sector
Laboratory and EquipmentThe simulation was conducted in the high fidelity Display System Replacement (DSR) Laboratory at the WJHTC.Ten display positions, all equipped with the User Request Evaluation Tool (URET), version 23AC, were utilized during the study (6 test positions, 4 ghost controller positions).The controllers used Voice Switch Communication System (VSCS).The ghost controllers provided hand-offs to and from the surrounding sectors.Workload Assessment Keypads (WAKs) were installed at each test position as a means of recording complexity ratings during the simulation scenarios.WAKs are electronic keypads containing numerical scales.Participants are prompted to press a button corresponding to workload by buttons that illuminate and an aural tone that activates at specified intervals.
ProcedureFour traffic scenarios were each shown twice during the simulation.The weather scenario was shown only once.CPCs rotated between Radar & Data positions.Controller were assigned to sectors in which they were familiar.The CPCs individually provided complexity ratings at 5-minute intervals for each simulation run, including one training run, via the WAKs.They rated complexity on a scale from 1 to 7 (1=very low, 4=moderate, 7=very high).
Step 2 -DD Metric Coding into DRATProgrammers from the TGF Group at the WJHTC coded the DD variables (provided in Tables 12345) into the Data Reduction and Analysis Tool (DRAT), which is a JAVA based postprocessing simulation data analysis tool.Trajectories and sector geometries used in the human-in-the-loop (HITL) real-time simulation were input into the DRAT software.The DRAT then calculated each DD variables at five minute intervals.During the HITL real-time simulation, controller workload ratings were also collected every five minutes.
Step 3 -Data Analysis & Model DevelopmentFor the data analysis and model development portion of the DD study, the researchers performed regression analyses of the complexity rating data and DD output to establish weights and significance for the different DD variables.The data set consisted of nine 75-minute runs, resulting in 693 ratings.Some runs resulted in one more rating than other runs depending on the exact time the run concluded.All variables were considered collectively since results from the first study showed that a unified DD metric (i.e., variables across organizations) performed the best.The results of the analysis are discussed in the following sections.
Results
DD Metrics DevelopmentThe regression analysis results, reported as R 2 values, are shown in Table 7. Note: R 2 is a coefficient of determination and higher its value, the higher the variance in complexity ratings explained by the model.The maximum value of R 2 is 1.0.
ModelsThe results indicated the following:• Both new and old DD metrics represented complexity better than currently used aircraft count.• The new DD metric more accurately represented complexity ratings for Cleveland ARTCC than the DD metric from the previous study as represented by higher R 2 values.• The aircraft count based model of the current study had higher R 2 than the aircraft count based model in the previous study.This could be because of differences in the data quality (i.e., SAR vs ETSM) and/or controllers were actively participating in the simulation rather than observers.This implies that the quality of complexity measurement improves with higher accuracy of data.The regression equation output for the DD metric is presented in Table 8.The table shows the significant variables and their corresponding weights (estimates), t-values, and p-values.The chosen level of significance was 0.05.Initially, 52 variables were entered into a stepwise regression which eliminated insignificant variables (p > .05).In addition, some predictors were excluded due to multicollinearity which occurs when high intercorrelations exist among the The resulting DD model consisted of 17 variables and accounted for 69% of the variability in the data.Measures of aircraft count and airspace structure were the most significant factors in the model (highest t-values).One of the motivators of this study was to identify the impact of RVSM on complexity since previous studies were conducted before RVSM was operational.It appears that the RVSM may have impacted the variable termed AD1 (Number of Aircraft/Occupied by Volume of Airspace).In the 2003 study, this variable was not significant.It is plausible that due to RVSM, the aircraft density was higher since higher altitude options are available in the same volume of airspace.
DD Metrics Testing
Results for Instantaneous DD ModelA performance assessment was conducted using the complete set of data.Figure 1 shows that the DD model followed the complexity ratings better than a model based only on aircraft count.Additionally, the R 2 value was higher for the DD model than the aircraft count based model.Table 9 shows the difference between the output of the DD model and the actual complexity ratings.About 94% of the data points were within a 1 unit difference from the actual complexity ratings and about 50% of the data points matched the ratings exactly.
NoteLess than 10% of the differences were greater than 2 units.
Value
Difference between DD and Complexity RatingsFigure 2 shows that the mean absolute difference (MAD) between complexity derived by the DD model and the actual complexity ratings was the lowest when the complexity ratings were closer to 2. The MAD generally increased as the complexity ratings increased.One possible explanation for this is that the data used to build the DD model contained a higher percentage of low complexity ratings and a much smaller percentage of high ratings.
Comparison with European Complexity FactorsFlynn et al. [11] indicated that controllers reported that a mix of climbing and descending aircraft, several traffic flows conversing at the same point, traffic bunching, a high number of aircraft, and multiple crossing points in the sector were critical complexity factors for Brussels and Hanover sectors.Majumdar et al. [16] reported that the number of aircraft changing altitudes, speed differences, the number of aircraft, the number of surrounding sectors, and intersection points contribute to airspace capacity and complexity in Europe.Many complexity factors discovered in the current NASA/FAA study are similar to those that were found in the European studies.To the extent a comparison is possible, the European results appear to be consistent with current findings where sector count, fraction of climbing and descending aircraft, and proximity of conflicting aircraft with respect to their separation minima and horizontal proximity were identified as significant complexity factors.
Overall Conclusions and Recommendations• The DD metric performed better than aircraft count, which is the basis of the presently used complexity gauge.• In comparison with the previous study, the results show an improved accuracy in the DD model.This could be due to a better source of data (i.e., SAR vs. ETMS), additional significant complexity variables that were not used previously (e.g., HDGVARI, AXISHDG, NUMHORIZ), or the ratings based on controller's direct interaction with the traffic rather than observation of replay.3 C10 Vertical proximity measure 3 C1133Time-to-go to conflict measure 1 C12 Time-to-go to conflict measure 2 C13 Time-to-go to conflict measure 3 C14 Variance of speed C15 Ratio of standard deviation of speed to average speed C16 Conflict resolution difficulty based on crossing angle
