IntroductionArrival congestion often inhibits efficient, continuous descent operations at many airports.Current air traffic control (ATC) techniques, without the aid of trajectory-based automation advisories, lead to many corrective changes in speed, path, and altitude profiles when controllers attempt to meter arrivals and maintain separation.The Efficient Descent Advisor (EDA) [1][2][3][4] is an automation tool that supports controllers with clearance advisories prior to top of descent that are designed to achieve precise meter-fix scheduled times of arrival while enabling continuous descents.Three-Dimensional Path Arrival Management (3D PAM) 3,5-7 is a concept for operational deployment of EDA that leverages EDA automation and the onboard vertical navigation (VNAV) capabilities of Flight Management Systems (FMS).What distinguishes 3D PAM from other EDA operational deployment concepts is that 3D PAM does not require an air/ground data-link communications capability.The 3D PAM clearance is designed so that the controller does not need to vector or assign temporary altitudes until the aircraft crosses the meter fix.The ability to fly more efficient speed and altitude profiles reduces fuel burn and emissions and maximizes utilization of the FMS.System benefits include increased flight path predictability and increased arrival-time delivery accuracy at the meter fix.The 3D PAM descent procedures were validated in a field test involving United and Continental Airlines flights arriving at Denver International Airport in the fall of 2009. 3The mean absolute value of the arrival-time error at the meter fix was estimated to be about 12 seconds with wind modeling noted as the main error source.While this and previous field trials focused on large (i.e., Boeing and Airbus) transport types, little attention has been paid to smaller (i.e., regional and business) jet types.Aside from the obvious differences in aircraft performance, the FMS capabilities and descent procedures involve significant differences critical to the accurate prediction of descent trajectories.The larger types, employing full performance-based VNAV capabilities for planning and executing continuous idle/nearidle descents, typically execute a relatively predictable profile that varies primarily with wind and descent speed.In comparison, the smaller jets employ a simpler FMS with "kinematic" VNAV guidance typically based on a fixed (inertial) flight-path angle.Moreover, the choice of descent angle is up to the pilot, and there exists little standardization in the selection of descent path or pilot procedure.To address this gap, a flight trial of 3D PAM small-jet descents was conducted in collaboration with the FAA and Boeing at Denver in the fall of 2010 using a Bombardier Global 5000 flight test aircraft provided by the FAA.The purpose of this test was threefold: (1) to develop and evaluate procedures in preparation for trials involving revenue flights with a regional carrier; (2) to assess the trajectory prediction accuracy under more controlled conditions; and (3) to collect the airborne data necessary to analyze the source and magnitude of prediction errors.A related field trial involving SkyWest Canadair Regional Jet revenue flights is addressed in Part II of this paper. 8A prior EDA flight trial 9-10 conducted at Denver in 1994 using a NASA B737 test aircraft with a performance-based FMS VNAV capability found that the dominant error source was the predicted winds aloft. 11e focus of this paper is quantifying the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) [12][13][14] trajectory prediction accuracy for small-jet descents and to identify and measure the trajectory prediction error sources.This work expands on an earlier paper 15 by elaborating on the error source quantification methodology and run-by-run results that quantify the impact of the error sources on the 44 runs.Trajectory prediction accuracy is useful for determining the operational viability of the 3D PAM concept in terms of meeting required times of arrival, conflict detection and resolution, and total prediction accuracy, such as accuracy of the vertical profile prior to the meter fix.If the trajectory predictions are too inaccurate, then controllers will need to issue additional tactical clearances for separation and conformance to the scheduled time of arrival.Insight into the trajectory prediction error sources could be used to develop techniques to compensate for these errors or, if necessary, to create larger uncertainty buffers used in automation tools.To measure the trajectory prediction accuracy, the CTAS trajectory synthesizer component is used to generate predictions that are compared to the flown trajectories in the trials.The primary consideration is the predicted time error.Other trajectory prediction accuracy metrics, such as predicted top of descent, bottom of descent, flight path angle, and altitude relative to the flown trajectory are used to describe differences between the predicted and flown trajectories.Seven error sources are identified and quantified based on analysis of radar track data along with air data computer (ADC) and global positioning system (GPS) data collected during the flight trial.The contribution of each error source to the time error is quantified along the predicted trajectory from top of descent to the meter fix and aggregated over all the runs.The paper is organized as follows.Section 2 describes the Global 5000 3D PAM flight trial at Denver.Section 3 describes how CTAS was used to predict trajectories.The quantification of arrival path trajectory prediction accuracy is presented in Section 4. Section 5 describes seven arrival path trajectory prediction error sources.Section 6 describes the method to quantify each of these seven error sources by incrementally replacing predicted data with data sensed on board the aircraft.This method was applied in Section 7 to quantify the relative magnitude of the seven error sources in terms of their contribution to time error along the descent prediction.These results are compared to a 1994 NASA B737 trial.Conclusions are then presented in Section 8.The Appendices provide run-by-run details including a ranking of which runs were most impacted by specific error sources and plots of the effects of each error source on each run.
Flight TrialData for the Global 5000 flight trial were collected between September 27, 2010, and October 8, 2010.This section describes the flight trial procedure, including the test matrix, arrival routing, VNAV procedures, and data collection.
Test MatrixA desired test matrix of 45 descent runs was comprised of a primary matrix, involving 36 straight-path descents using speed control, and 9 runs with path stretch and speed control.These descent runs are respectively referred to as "direct" and "path stretch" through this paper.The Global 5000 aircraft was able to complete 35 of the 36 direct runs and all 9 path-stretch runs.One of the runs was scratched, and the desired test matrix was not completed, due to conflicting priorities with other flight trial objectives.A summary of the 44 flown runs is shown in Table 1.Each descent run involved a fixed flight path angle (FPA) descent with a vertical profile anchored at the meter-fix crossing restriction and extending back upstream to define the top of descent.For the purpose of this test, the flight crew had the option of selecting one of two predefined FPAs depending on the cruise Mach and descent calibrated airspeed (CAS) combinations shown in Table 1.These two FPAs were defined to be consistent with typical descents performed by the FAA pilots in the Global 5000 aircraft.The choice allowed the pilot to pick the angle best suited for the relative winds aloft during that particular run.While the methodology for selecting the FPA would be ambiguous in current-day operations, it is assumed here that the selection is procedurally defined to ensure that ATC and the supporting automation have accurate knowledge of the planned FPA. 16,17The right-hand columns of Table 1 show the number of flown runs for each FPA for direct and path-stretch runs, which differs from the desired test matrix.The goal of the primary matrix was to obtain an even sampling of nine direct runs, each across the four main arrival gates of the Denver TRACON, to obtain a balance of headwind and tailwind cases.The four meter fixes (LANDR, RAMMS, QUAIL, and LARKS) correspond to the four arrival gates shown in the left-hand column of Table 1.The nine runs were comprised of three descent speed profiles, spanning the speed envelope (250, 280, and 300 knots CAS), repeated three times each.The total, which was planned to equal three, was obtained by totaling the runs for each FPA.LANDR is missing one 250-knot descent, and there was one extra 280-knot descent into LARKS instead of a 250-knot descent.This was caused by a late clearance during run 10 where the pilot declared unable to descend at -2.0 degrees at 250 knots, which resulted in a revised clearance of -2.5 degrees at 280 knots.Of the nine pathstretch test matrix runs planned, three runs for each descent CAS irrespective of meter fix, only two were collected at 250 knots, three at 280 knots, and four at 300 knots.
Arrival RoutingThe arrival routes for each of the four arrival gates are shown in Figure 1.Each arrival, both direct (solid black line) and path stretch (dashed black line), began at a cruising altitude of 30,000 to 36,000 feet approximately 95 to 120 nmi from the meter fix.The flight crew then descended the aircraft to the meter-fix crossing altitude of 19,000 feet with a deceleration initiated during descent in time to meet the meter-fix crossing speed restriction of 250 knots.Once past the meter fix, ATC vectored the aircraft to the starting point for the next run (grey line) while the aircraft climbed back to the desired initial altitude for that run.For example, the direct-path arrival route for the northeast arrival gate was initiated at SNY050040 (a position 40 nmi from the Sidney (SNY) VORTAC along the 050 o radial), and flown direct to LANDR.The corresponding path-stretch route was also initiated at SNY050040 and flown direct SNY140035, direct LANDR.Repositioning the aircraft for another run from the northwest involved vectors to YOKES, then direct COPLA, direct HANKI, direct SNY030045, and direct SNY050040.
VNAVDuring the flight trial, VNAV capability was used for vertical guidance only and was not coupled to the autopilot and autothrottle.VNAV was set up in this way on the Global 5000 to be consistent with the capabilities of the FMS aboard Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) models 200, 700, and 900.These CRJ models were used for 3D PAM flight trials involving SkyWest airlines that followed the Bombardier Global 5000 runs and are the subject of Part II of this paper. 8
Data CollectionThe following subset of ADC and GPS data were automatically recorded during the flight test and used to identify and quantify the error sources.Time, latitude, longitude, pressure altitude (ADC), and ground-referenced altitude (GPS) were recorded to establish aircraft position.The current aircraft speed was recorded including indicated airspeed (IAS), true airspeed (TAS), Mach, and ground speed.The Mach and CAS being targeted were recorded to establish the target speed.The atmospheric conditions recorded and used in this analysis included wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and air density.Details of the clearance and other comments were manually recorded on board and on the ground.Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) radar track data was recorded at the 12-second radar sweep update rate.Atmospheric information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) data was recorded and archived for post- analysis.The EDA clearances, rather than the trajectory predictions, were recorded during the flight test to facilitate the generation of the CTAS-predicted trajectories during post-processing.
Trajectory PredictionThe trajectory predictor used for this study was the trajectory synthesizer (TS) component of the CTAS12-1414 software version.It generated a four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction (three spatial dimensions and time) based on the radar track position and ground speed at each run's initial condition.This initial position was typically 60 to 85 nmi from the meter fix for the direct runs, and 100 to 120 nmi from the meter fix for path-stretch runs.The initial condition for direct runs was selected to be a point at which the aircraft had repositioned itself on the direct route with its course stabilized for 4 to 8 nmi.The initial condition for path-stretch runs was selected at a point about 5 to 8 nmi before the aircraft started its path-stretch turn.For the path-stretch runs, the initial condition was selected at points outside any turn to avoid ground speed bias in the track data during turns.Because CTAS requires special processing to parse a flight plan that contains more than one arrival or departure route, the flight plans issued for the Global 5000 test flight-which included repeated arrival and departure routes-could not be readily parsed by CTAS in real time.Accordingly, the trajectory predictions were computed off-line after the field trial had ended, using the atmospheric conditions, EDA clearances, and meter-fix crossing restrictions that would have been known to the ground automation system at the start of each run.Each trajectory prediction was run once and not updated during the descent to the meter fix.The horizontal path for each descent trajectory was modeled as a sequence of straight-line and turn segments around waypoints.For the turns, the TS used a default bank angle (θ) of 20.8 degrees, standard gravity (g), and an estimated average ground speed (v) at the location of the turn to compute the turn radius (r) according to equation (1).The default bank angle (θ) was used by the TS for the trajectories of all flights in the Center.= ^ /( )(1)Figure 2 shows segments of the vertical profile modeled by TS for the Global 5000 runs.Segment 1 turned out to be unnecessary because, prior to issuing the clearances, controllers ascertained the aircraft's current Mach number and instructed pilots to maintain that Mach number as the target cruise Mach number.Descent segments 3, 4, and 5 maintained a constant FPA in accordance with the issued clearance.Segment 5 had non-zero duration of time only if the descent CAS was greater than the meter-fix crossing restriction speed.Among the 44 runs analyzed, 22 required a CAS deceleration segment.The cruise Mach segment (segment 2) was constructed by TS using a cruise Mach number computed from CTAS-estimated ground speed at the initial condition.Due to tracker jumps and weather/wind forecast errors, this estimated cruise Mach number differed from the flown target cruise Mach number.The CAS deceleration segment (segment 5) at the end of the trajectory was modeled as follows.The TS first attempted a constant FPA, idle thrust descent for the 22 runs with descent CAS higher than the meter-fix crossing speed restriction.For some runs, the trajectory generation failed as the idle thrust descent could not slow down the aircraft to meet the meter-fix crossing speed restriction.Technically, the equations of motion were integrated backward from the meter fix up the descent segment.A trajectory would fail if the descent segment did not have enough length to allow the airspeed to capture the descent CAS during the descent.In these cases, the effect of deployed speed brake was modeled.The TS modeled the speed brake drag by a fixed "dirty" drag coefficient (arising from the aircraft's change from its clean configuration), and a percentage of speed brake usage.Due to the lack of a standard procedure, it was assumed that pilots would use the minimum speed brake needed to capture the target speed.This modeling choice is discussed in Section 7, Results.The speed brake drag coefficient was increased incrementally by 10 percent until a valid trajectory was generated.Among the 22 runs that required a deceleration segment, 10 of them (runs 1, 5, 6, 7, 16, 18, 20, 24, 27, and 40) required 10 percent of full speed brake deployment.Run 13, in particular, required 20 percent of full speed brake deployment.The other 11 runs did not require speed brake usage.
Trajectory Prediction AccuracyThe accuracy of the CTAS trajectory predictor was measured by comparing the recorded radar tracks from the 3D PAM flight trials with the corresponding trajectories predicted by CTAS.This comparison was based on the spatial location (latitude/longitude) on the predicted trajectory closest to each radar track position.This technique 18 is referred to as "closest segment spatial error" or spatial correlation.The distribution of time error at the meter fix across all runs is presented in Figure 3. Aircraft generally arrived at the fix earlier than predicted as indicated by the negative values along the x-axis in Figure 3.The trajectory prediction error sources described in Section 5 and quantified in Section 7 are used to explain this time error.The mean (-15.4 sec) and standard deviation (9.9 sec) of the time error at the meter fix for direct runs are shown in the left columns in Table 2, along with other summary statistics.Runs with path stretches shown in the right columns in Table 2 show a significantly larger mean error (-27.0 sec) and standard deviation (25.8 sec) than direct runs.The top of descent (ii) and bottom of descent (iii) were both 0.3 nmi closer to the meter fix than predicted for direct runs.For path-stretch runs, the top of descent and bottom of descent were 0.5 nmi and 0.7 nmi respectively, closer to the meter fix.The relatively small FPA (iv) error for both direct (-0.01 deg) and path-stretch (-0.03 deg) runs indicates that the aircraft flew a slightly steeper descent than predicted.The maximum cross-track error (v) is the average of the maximum cross-track error for each of the direct (0.4-nmi cross-track error) and path-stretch (2.2-nmi cross-track error) runs.The altitude error (vi) ranged from 30 to 100 feet lower than predicted during direct descents and 100 to 175 feet lower than predicted during pathstretch descents.
Description of Error SourcesSeven principal sources of error were identified: tracker jumps, wind, CAS deceleration, speed conformance, target mach, atmosphere/altitude, and path distance.These are annotated as sources A through G in Figure 4.The white circles along the vertical profile in Figure 4 correspond to nine reference locations along the predicted trajectory where results were aggregated across all runs.While the bottom of descent should coincide with the meter-fix location, they are analyzed separately because of the differences in the actual bottom of descent flown (quantified as the bottom-of-descent location metric in Table 2).Section 6 describes the method to quantify error source magnitudes.
Tracker JumpsTracker jumps, due to truncation of the time component (i.e., dropping significant digits) of the En Route Host radar tracker resulting from legacy technical limitations, introduce noise into the time error data.The dashed line in Figure 5 shows an example of tracker jumps from the second run.The x-axis is the distance along the predicted path starting at the initial condition and ending at the meter fix.The y-axis is the flown time minus the predicted time at the specified distance from the initial condition.The uncorrected curve (dashed line) shows "jumps" of approximately 6 seconds in the time difference between successive values while the corrected curve (solid line) somewhat mitigates this effect.The magnitude of the jumps is included in Appendix A based on the method described in Section 6.The tracker jump error was aggregated across all runs at the nine locations shown along the x-axis of the Figure 6      third quartile.The error due to tracker jumps does not significantly grow in magnitude along the trajectory, which is the case for the other six error sources discussed next.
WindThere are two sources of error with respect to the atmospheric model used in the trajectory predictor.One is the difference between winds estimated in the NOAA RUC model and the winds observed by aircraft sensors.Section 5.6 describes the second atmospheric model error source, which is the difference between the temperature and pressure estimated by the models, and the values sensed by the aircraft.Figure 7 shows an example where the aircraft flew into less of a headwind than expected (negative values along y-axis indicate headwind).The difference between the RUC model-predicted winds and winds recorded by the ADC is used to generate the effect of corrected winds on ground speed in Figure 8.There is a small wind error (< 5 knots) up to about 40 nmi along the predicted path (about 20 nmi after the top of descent).The wind error then grows to a maximum of about 17 knots overpredicted headwind (i.e., RUC model predicted a stronger headwind than occurred) at about 55 nmi along the predicted path.This difference in predicted vs. actual winds results in about a 6-second time difference at the meter fix as shown in the Figure 9 time error plot.The wind error, which is the difference between the uncorrected and corrected trajectory times, was aggregated to generate the wind error box plot shown in Figure 10. Figure 10 shows that there was more of a tailwind (median is negative) than predicted, which caused the aircraft to arrive at the fix earlier than predicted.The wind errors are also cumulative and increase in magnitude from the top of descent to the meter fix.
CAS DecelerationAll aircraft were required to cross their assigned meter fix at or below a defined CAS.However, there may be differences in how a pilot reduces CAS to meet the meter-fix crossing airspeed.Generally, the Global 5000 flight crew did not level the aircraft off at the meter-fix altitude and reduce CAS in a level segment.In order to be consistent with this behavior, the CTAS trajectory synthesizer did not model a level segment at the meter-fix altitude.However, the level-off segment was an error source for a few of the runs where the aircraft reached its bottom of descent before crossing the meter fix.The start of the CAS deceleration segment is defined as the location where the aircraft is predicted to start reducing airspeed below the issued descent CAS.For example, in Figure 11 the constant CAS of 300 knots was predicted to occur at approximately 53 to 60 nmi from the initial condition.The aircraft was predicted to begin decelerating from 300-to 250-knots CAS starting at approximately 60 nmi from the initial condition.In this case, the aircraft actually maintained the descent CAS of 300 knots until approximately 70 nmi from the initial condition.At about 75 nmi along the predicted path, the aircraft TAS is about 30 knots higher than was predicted in the "Effect of CAS deceleration" plot in Figure 12.This difference would cause the aircraft to arrive at the meter fix 13 seconds earlier than predicted in the absence of other error sources as shown in the time error plot in Figure 13.The CAS deceleration error was aggregated to generate the box plot shown in Figure 14.The deceleration error is negligible near the top of descent because only a few runs were predicted to begin the CAS deceleration segment within 6,000 feet of the initial altitude (IA-6K).The CAS deceleration error begins to grow significantly near the bottom of descent because this error source is only quantified in locations where the aircraft is predicted to be reducing CAS.On average, the CAS deceleration errors are negative, indicating a similar behavior to that shown in Figure 11.The behavior in Figure 11, and for the majority of the cases, has the predicted CAS deceleration starting to occur earlier than the flown trajectory and at a slower rate of deceleration.A faster flown deceleration rate allowed the aircraft to be closer to the meter fix before starting to decelerate.These results suggest that the pilots may have used speed brake more heavily than modeled by the CTAS trajectory predictor.Alternatively, at idle thrust the aircraft may have reduced CAS faster than CTAS predicted due to inaccurate performance parameters for the Global 5000 test aircraft.
Speed ConformanceA speed conformance error occurs when an aircraft deviates from its target CAS.For example, if an aircraft is targeting a descent CAS of 250 knots but is flying 260 knots, then there is a speed conformance error of 10 knots.This is the case for the example shown in Figure 15, which is corrected starting at about 20 nmi from the initial condition (about 60 nmi from meter fix).The effect of corrected speed conformance on ground speed is shown in Figure 16.As the descent proceeds, the impact of speed conformance grows to about 3 seconds when the aircraft is about 45 nmi from the initial condition.In the end, however, speed conformance does not significantly impact time error at the meter fix in this case, as shown in Figure 17.The speed conformance effect on ground speed is quantified along the predicted constant-CAS segment between the predicted Mach-to-CAS transition location and the location where the aircraft is predicted to start to decelerate to meet the meter-fix speed restriction.The start of the constant-CAS segment was identified by two conditions: (1) the altitude is below the initial altitude, and (2) the Mach is below the initial Mach for the en route segment.The last data point of the segment is when the aircraft is predicted to start decelerating, and the CAS drops below the descent CAS.The speed conformance error was aggregated in order to generate the box plot shown in Figure 18. Figure 18 shows that the effect of speed conformance grows between the top of descent and bottom of descent, which in this study is expected because error source quantification is cumulative from the initial condition to the meter fix.
Target MachThe aircraft may have been targeting a different Mach than was predicted by the CTAS trajectory synthesizer.Run 36 shown in Figure 19 is an example of target Mach error where the aircraft is flying a faster Mach than predicted prior to the transition from constant Mach to constant CAS, located about 45 nmi downstream of the initial condition (about 35 nmi from the meter fix).The predicted Mach is low due to the low ground speed estimated by the radar tracker after the aircraft turns onto the arrival route to begin its run.The flown target Mach of 0.76 (black 'o' marker), flown Mach between 0.73 and 0.76 (black filled marker), and predicted Mach of 0.72 (grey '+' marker) are all shown in Figure 19.This Mach difference is converted into an effect on ground speed as shown in Figure 20.Removing this error source in Figure 21 shows that the faster Mach causes the aircraft to arrive at the meter fix about 15 seconds earlier than predicted.The target Mach error was aggregated in order to generate the box plot shown in Figure 22. Figure 22 shows that, on average, the aircraft flew a faster Mach than was predicted (negative values).Also, as expected, the target Mach error primarily occurred prior to top of descent because during descent the aircraft transitions to constant CAS.The target Mach error was higher for path-stretch runs than direct runs because the initial condition for path-stretch runs is closer to the turn from the repositioning route to the arrival route (i.e., further from the meter fix), which causes the path-stretch runs to be impacted more by the ground speed estimated by the radar tracker than the direct runs.
Atmosphere/AltitudeAtmospheric conditions including temperature and air density are used to convert the targeted airspeed to TAS which, taking into account winds, is then converted to ground speed.This error source focused on the predicted vs. flown atmospheric conditions, which introduce errors in the conversion of Mach and CAS to TAS.In the case of Mach, TAS is the product of Mach, speed of sound at sea level (a constant), and the square root of the ratio of static air temperature in which the aircraft is flying (recorded by ADC) to the temperature at sea level (a constant).In the case of CAS, TAS is a product of CAS and the square root of the ratio of air density at sea level (a constant) to the air density in which the aircraft is flying (recorded by ADC).Flying higher or lower than predicted similarly changes the TAS through changes in air temperature and density, and was also captured by this error source.The altitude/ atmosphere errors were quantified as a CAS-to-TAS and Mach-to-TAS conversion error as described in Section 6.A comparison between predicted and flown altitude, air temperature, and air density is included in Appendices C and D even though these were not used directly to quantify the magnitude of the atmosphere/altitude error source.For example, Figure 23 shows a case where the aircraft was up to 175 feet lower than predicted from the top of descent at about 20 nmi from the initial condition to about 15 nmi from the meter fix.This caused the aircraft to be flying about 1 to 1.5 knots faster than predicted, which is corrected according to the "effect of atmosphere/altitude on ground speed" plot in Figure 24. Figure 25 shows that the atmosphere and altitude error source increased the arrival-time error from about 1 second to about 2 seconds.The box plot aggregating the atmosphere and altitude errors in Figure 26 shows that the error primarily impacts the descent portion, which is expected because this is the location most likely to have a difference between predicted and flown altitudes.The negative medians in the box plot indicate that, on average, the aircraft flew a lower altitude than predicted, which increased ground speed and caused the aircraft to arrive at the meter fix earlier than predicted.
Path DistanceAircraft deviated from their predicted lateral path causing variance in the distance from the initial condition to the meter fix.For direct runs, any variance from the predicted lateral path would result in a longer flown path distance than predicted.However, all of the path-stretch runs flew a shorter path through the turn than predicted.The lateral profile in Figure 27 is an example of using a shorter path midway through a southeast-bound descent that starts in the upper right corner of the plot.At the middle of the curve, the aircraft is about 1.8 nmi away from the predicted lateral path (i.e., cross-track error of 1.8 nmi).This path is about 1.2 nmi shorter than predicted and is applied as a change in path distance shown in Figure 28 rather than the ground speed change applied in the previous error sources excluding tracker jumps.The shorter path distance contributes about 9 seconds to the aircraft being early to the meter fix as shown in the time error plot in Figure 29.As expected, the shorter path distance in the path-stretch runs caused the aircraft to arrive earlier than predicted, as shown in the box plot that aggregates the path distance in Figure 30.The path stretch occurs at or near the top of descent, which is why the effect of path distance is primarily before the top of descent as shown in Figure 30.The longer path distance in the direct runs caused the aircraft to arrive later than predicted as indicated by the positive errors in Figure 30.
Method to Quantify Magnitude of Error SourcesError sources are quantified incrementally (i.e., quantify wind and tracker jumps after correcting for tracker jumps only) to isolate the contribution of each error source to the overall trajectory time error.For example, comparing a trajectory that has wind and tracker jump error sources removed against a trajectory that has just the tracker jump error source removed will estimate the impact of wind errors.Any interactions between error sources will affect the error source magnitudes.Larger interactions between error sources are expected to cause the order that error sources are quantified to become more significant.However, the interactions are relatively small in magnitude as shown by the normalized correlation coefficients in Section 7, so the focus will be on first-order analysis of error sources.The order in which the error sources were quantified was based on an initial estimate of the magnitude of the errors and potential interactions between error sources.The tracker jump quantification method was applied first to remove noise so that trends due to the other error sources could be examined.Wind was quantified next because it was found to be the largest error source from an earlier flight trial of large jets. 11CAS deceleration, speed conformance, and target Mach error sources were modeled (at different locations along the cruise and descent) to interact with wind and atmosphere/altitude, therefore the error source quantification method was not impacted by the order of these three error sources.Atmosphere/altitude and path distance had the smallest error magnitudes as described in Section 7 and were quantified last.The impact of error source quantification order was estimated by shifting the wind and atmosphere/altitude error source before and after each of the other error sources.Shifting the quantification of the wind error source, which has a relatively large impact compared to the other error sources, was found to impact the mean time error attributed to the other error sources by 2.4 percent or less, and the standard deviation of the time error attributed to the other error sources by 3.0 percent or less.Similarly shifting the atmosphere/altitude error source impacted the mean time error attributed to the other error sources by 1.2 percent or less, and the standard deviation of the time error attributed to the other error sources by 1.3 percent or less.Removing the tracker jump error source directly alters the time error.The other error sources, except path distance, are removed by replacing predicted components of the ground speed (wind, TAS, CAS, Mach, temperature, air density) with the observed values recorded by the air data computer.The time error is then derived from the updated CTAS-predicted time component along the trajectory.The path distance error source is removed by replacing predicted distance with the flown distance.
Tracker JumpsTracker jump errors are quantified along two segments: (1) the en route radar segment, and (2) at the transition between the en route radar and terminal radar.An example of these two locations is shown in Figure 31 for run 4.The en route radar segment shown on the  The magnitudes of the jumps in the en route radar segment are quantified as follows.The y-axis of Figure 31 is the time error, which is not expected to change significantly between radar locations.If the change, either positive or negative, is too high, then it is marked for correction.Radar tracks with jumps were corrected rather than omitted because there could be several track updates in a row with jumps, and locations, such as the location of top of descent, needed to be identified.The correction is used as the magnitude of the error source.Positive (3.30 sec) and negative (-3.35 sec) thresholds that define "too high" were selected by examining histograms of the change in time error as shown in Figure 32 for all runs.The average of the data points outside the threshold is used to estimate the magnitude of the error for negative jumps (e.g., -7.2 sec for run 4) and positive jumps (e.g., 5.9 sec for run 4).The negative of this error is applied to each jump as a correction.If this correction does not sum to zero, then it is subsequently adjusted by increasing the magnitude of the smaller error, either positive or negative jump, as a correction.A summary of the magnitudes of the tracker jump error source for all runs is included in Appendix A.Equations (2) to (8) describe the quantification of the tracker jump error source and the other error sources.Equation (2) is the initial time error that has not been corrected for any error sources.This initial time error (∆ ) is the data series labeled "Uncorrected" in Figure 31 and is the flown time at radar track i ( ) minus the CTAS-predicted time at radar track i ( ).The errors are then subtracted out for each error source K = A to G according to Equation (2) to provide a revised time estimate (∆ ) that is labeled "(A) Tracker" in Figure 31 for K = A. The magnitude of the tracker jump error source is the second term on the right-hand side of Equation (3).This second term is the summation of all tracker jump errors up to and including the current radar track i using the magnitudes ( ) specified in Appendix A.The third term in Equation (3), which is surrounded by square brackets, is the magnitude of the error source for error sources K = B to G and is used to iteratively subtract out the effects of each error source.The first term in the square brackets is an estimate of the time between radar track locations, calculated as path distance ( -) divided by true airspeed ( , ) plus the wind vector ( , ), using a combination of CTAS-predicted and aircraft data according to Table 3.The second term in the square brackets substitutes aircraft data to mitigate the effects of error source K.This substitution of aircraft data for CTAS-predicted data is described in Table 3 and Sections 6.2 to 6.7.Equations (4) to (7) are used to convert CAS to TAS 19 and are discussed in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.Equation ( 8) is similarly used to convert Mach to TAS 19 and is discussed in Section 6.5.

WindThe wind error is quantified by replacing the CTAS-predicted winds with the winds recorded on board the aircraft.This is specified as flown in the ( , ) row of the Wind column in Table 3.
CAS DecelerationThe CAS deceleration error source is quantified by replacing the CTAS-predicted CAS with the CAS recorded on board the aircraft ( , ) along the segment where CTAS is predicting the aircraft to decelerate to the meter-fix crossing speed restriction.This replacement has no effect on the constant-Mach and constant-CAS segments.Flown CAS is multiplied by the ratio of predicted true airspeed ( , ) to predicted CAS ( , ) according to Equation (3) to derive true airspeed.The ratio accounts for compressibility and air density effects, and will be replaced by flown data when the atmosphere and altitude error source is quantified according to Section 6.6.The ratio could be replaced in the model to convert CAS to TAS as shown in Equations (4) to (6) in order to identify which condition-static pressure ( ), impact pressure ( , ), or temperature ( )-has the greatest effect on the atmosphere/altitude error source.However, using Equations (4) to (6) to convert CAS to TAS using flown CAS, static pressure, impact pressure, and temperature was found to produce a TAS value that deviated from flown TAS by as much as 3 knots, which is similar to introducing a conversion error source.Plots of this deviation are included for each direct run in Appendix C and for each path-stretch run in Appendix D. For this reason, the "TAS divided by CAS" ratio was used throughout to mitigate this effect.Other terms introduced in Equations (3) to (6) include the ratio of specific heats for air ( ), air density at sea level ( ), air density at aircraft altitude ( ) calculated according to Equation (6), gas constant for air ( ), atmospheric pressure at sea level ( ), and compressibility factors ( , , ) calculated according to Equations (4) and (5).
Speed ConformanceThe speed conformance error source is quantified similar to the CAS deceleration error source by replacing CTAS-predicted CAS with CAS recorded onboard the aircraft.However, the speed conformance error source applies along the constant-CAS descent segment.The CAS deceleration and speed conformance columns in Table 3 are the same, but the changes are applied at different locations.The target Mach error source is similarly only applied from the initial condition up to the location of the transition from constant Mach to constant CAS.
Target MachThe target Mach error source is quantified by replacing the CTAS-predicted Mach with Mach recorded on board the aircraft ( , ) from the initial condition to the location of the transition from constant Mach to constant CAS.Flown Mach is multiplied by the ratio of predicted true airspeed ( , ) to predicted Mach ( , ) according to Equation (7) to derive true airspeed.The ratio accounts for temperature and other atmospheric effects, and is replaced by flown data when the atmosphere and altitude error source is quantified next in Section 6.6.Similar to CAS, a model for converting Mach to TAS could be substituted for the ratio, but an error source may be introduced, and significant additional insights would not be expected due to the relatively small residual and atmosphere/altitude error source as compared to the magnitude of the other error sources.
6.6.Atmosphere/AltitudeThe atmosphere/altitude error source focused on the predicted vs. flown atmospheric conditions, which introduce errors in the conversion of Mach (constant-Mach segment) and CAS (constant-CAS and deceleration segments) to true airspeed.Flying higher or lower than predicted similarly changes the true airspeed and was also captured by this error source.This error source was quantified by replacing true airspeed calculated according to Equations ( 3) and ( 7) with true airspeed recorded on board the aircraft ( , ).Appendices C and D provide comparisons of CTAS-predicted to flown static pressure, impact pressure, and temperature, even though these components were not each converted to an impact on time error.
Path DistancePath distance is quantified by replacing the CTAS-predicted path distance between successive locations with the flown distance between successive locations ( -).The only predicted data in Equation (2) when quantifying path distance (K = G) is -.
ResultsThis section presents the combined impact of the seven trajectory prediction error sources at locations along the predicted trajectory.Also, the percentage contribution of the error sources to the total time-error variance at the meter fix is shown.A comparison to the results of a 1994 flight test using NASA's Boeing 737 test aircraft is presented last.Four of the direct runs (runs 5, 9, 11, and 16) contained anomalies that are not expected to be consistent with future EDA operations (e.g., pilot changing target descent CAS midway through descent) and were therefore excluded from the analysis.Details of these runs are provided in Appendix C. Excluding these runs had less than a 4-percent impact on the means and standard deviations presented in this section.
Magnitude of Error SourcesThe magnitude of the error sources is shown at the top of descent (Fig. 33) and meter fix (Fig. 34).In both of the figures the seven error sources-from tracker jumps (error source A) to path distance (error source G)-are presented along the x-axis.Also presented on the x-axis are the combined effect of these seven error sources (total error) and the residual error after correcting for these seven error sources.Figure 33 shows the contribution of each error source to time errors that accumulate from the initial condition to the top of descent.Comparing Figure 34 to Figure 33 shows the contribution of each error source that accumulates during descent from the top of descent to the meter fix.For direct runs, the target Mach error source is the most dominant error source at the top of descent (μ = -1.7 sec, σ = 4.3 sec at TOD) and remains, relatively, the most significant error source throughout the descent (μ = -1.1 sec, σ = 5.7 sec at MF) as measured by the standard deviation of the error sources.The focus is more on the standard deviation of the error rather than the mean of the error because the mean and median effects of the error sources are generally close to zero, but there can be a large spread in the data.The deceleration error source becomes significant (μ = -5.0sec, σ = 5.2 sec at MF), and approximately the same magnitude of effect as target Mach near the meter fix.The wind, speed conformance, altitude/atmosphere, and path distance error sources are the smallest in magnitude relative to the other error sources at the meter fix.For path-stretch runs, the target Mach error source has the largest effect on time error throughout the descent.As expected, the path stretch results in higher contributions of path distance to total error for the path-stretch runs (μ = -5.2sec, σ = 5.0 sec at MF) as compared to the direct runs (μ = 2.3 sec, σ = 0.9 sec at MF).The other error sources have a similar and less significant effect on the total error than target Mach and path distance.A summary of the mean and standard deviation of the effect of the error sources at the meter fix is included in Table 4.The mean and standard deviation at five locations from the top of descent to the meter fix is included in Appendix E. For example, the row for target Mach shows a -1.1-second and 5.7-second mean and standard deviation, respectively, for direct descents, and a -7.5-second and 15.9-second mean and standard deviation, respectively, for path-stretch descents.The difference between the direct and path-stretch runs may be attributed to the path-stretch routing, which was in close proximity of a turn.Mean and standard deviation at six locations along the predicted trajectory are included in Appendix B for completeness.1.6 a The turn in 1994 was similar to the path-stretch runs in 2010 in that the waypoint defining the turn was programmed into the FMS prior to descent.b Excludes experimental error source.
Percentage Contribution to Total VarianceThe contributions of each error source to the mean total error at the meter fix are a straightforward summation of the mean errors.However, the percentage contribution of each error source to the variance (σ 2 ) of the time error at the meter fix requires estimating and applying a variancecovariance matrix shown in rows labeled "cov" in Tables 5 and6 for direct and path-stretch runs, respectively.The diagonal of the variance-covariance matrix is the variance for each of the error sources.For example, the variance of the tracker jump error source at the meter fix ( , = 13.5 sec 2 ) shown in the upper left in Table 5 is the square of the standard deviation at the meter fix ( , = 3.7 sec) shown in Table 4.The covariance values off the diagonal can be either positive or negative.Positive covariance indicates a relationship where higher values of one error source are associated with higher values of another error source.For example, for the covariance in Table 5 for direct runs, the covariance between wind and speed conformance ( , = 2.42 sec 2 ) is positive indicating that higher time errors caused by wind are associated with higher time errors caused by speed conformance.Negative covariance indicates a relationship where higher values of one error source are associated with lower values of another compensating error source.For example, for the covariance in Table 6 for path-stretch runs, the covariance between deceleration and speed conformance ( , = -32.79sec 2 ) is negative indicating that higher speed conformance errors are associated with lower deceleration errors.A normalized correlation coefficient that ranges from -1 to 1 is also given in Tables 5 and6 to show the strength of a linear relationship between the error sources.The largest correlation coefficient was between the target Mach and the atmosphere/altitude (0.70), because the target Mach error results from temperature and pressure forecast errors.The total variance is the sum of all elements in the variance-covariance matrices in Tables 5 and6 for direct (σ 2 = 9.88 2 = 97.54sec 2 ) and path-stretch (σ 2 = 25.78 2 = 664.73sec 2 ) runs, respectively.It is not possible to completely decouple the contribution of each error source to the total variance due to covariance between the error sources.However, the percentage of the total variance ( ) due to error source K is approximated in Equation 9 by dividing covariance equally between the two error sources.Because the variance-covariance matrix is symmetrical and covariance appears twice, the percentage ( ) is calculated by summing the variance ( , ) and covariance ( , , where j does not equal K) in the K th column and then dividing by the total variance ( ).The right-hand side numerator (sum of covariance) and the percentage (percent of total variance) in Equation 9 are calculated and shown in the last two rows in Tables 5 and6. = ∑ ,(9)The target Mach error source (30.6 percent for direct and 60.2 percent for path stretch) had the highest contribution to the total time error variance at the meter fix.The target Mach error source for direct runs also had significant positive covariance with the other error sources, which resulted in a higher contribution to the total time error variance than would have occurred in the absence of other error sources.Deceleration (23.7 percent for direct and -17.5 percent for path stretch) and speed conformance (14.0 percent for direct and 16.8 percent for path stretch) are other error sources with a relatively large contribution to the total time error variance.The negative contribution of CAS deceleration (-17.5 percent), which is caused by negative covariance with other error sources that is larger in magnitude than the CAS deceleration positive variance, to the total time error variance indicates that CAS deceleration compensates for other error sources during path-stretch runs.The results in Tables 5 and6 are based on the error source quantification order described previously in Section 6. Changing this order impacts the percentage of the total variance attributed primarily to the wind error source.The wind error source is reduced from 9.8 percent to 9.3 percent for direct runs and increased from 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent for path-stretch runs if the wind error source is quantified after the target Mach error source.An analysis on trajectory error sources was performed for a NASA B737 test aircraft using results from a 1994 EDA field trial. 11Those results were compared to the results from the 2010 flight trial using Global 5000 aircraft.The earlier study considered 4 levels of cockpit automation during 25 arrival runs to Denver.The comparison presented here will focus on six of the 1994 runs that used a conventional FMS with lateral navigation (LNAV) and VNAV.Seven error sources were identified in the earlier field trial:(1) experimental error, (2) temperature, (3) airspeed conformance, (4) altitude, (5) initial ground speed, (6) turn overshoot, and (7) wind.The mean and standard deviation of these error sources are shown in Table 4.The total error was lower in 1994 (μ = -4.6 sec, σ = 13.9 sec) than the error in 2010 for direct (μ = -15.6 sec, σ = 9.9 sec) and path-stretch (μ = -27.0sec, σ = 25.8 sec) runs.However, the experimental setup in 1994 was different than 2010, complicating the comparison.There was a position bias in the radar tracker in 1994 that led to the error source analysis being partly based on GPS position data recorded on board the B737 rather than using the radar tracker position (radar tracker speed was still used for the initial condition).Therefore, the tracker jump error source in 2010 has no equivalent in 1994.The 1994 initial condition was based on both cruise and descent speeds issued by controllers, which reduce the error in estimated Mach at the initial condition.In 2010, only the issued descent speed was used in generating CTAS predictions, and the target Mach was estimated by the radar tracker ground speed, rather than by the Mach issued by ATC, which increases this error source relative to 1994.Lastly, the 1994 flight trial used a calibrated B737 model in CTAS that would better predict turns than the 2010 Global 5000 turn model.For these reasons a comparison of the total error between 1994 and 2010 was made based on the mean of the following error sources: wind, CAS deceleration, airspeed conformance, atmosphere, altitude, and temperature.When comparing this error source subset, the total mean error is higher in 2010 for both direct (μ = -10.2sec) and path-stretch (μ = -7.9sec) runs than was observed in 1994 (μ = -3.4sec).This higher error is primarily due to higher CAS deceleration errors in 2010.A discussion of the seven 1994 error sources is included next with their closest equivalent error source identified in 2010.Experimental errors were caused by CTAS computational and data errors that were corrected after the 1994 flight trial.These errors did not exist in the results from the Global 5000 runs.Temperature and altitude were combined into a single error source with a resulting mean and standard deviation of less than 3 seconds for both direct and path-stretch runs.The 1994 results were similar, with temperature having a negligible effect and altitude have a small effect.The 1994 airspeed conformance error contributed 1 second to the arrival time error (μ = 1.0 sec, σ = 2.4 sec).The 2010 Global 5000 runs had higher standard deviation of the errors associated with speed conformance for both the direct (μ = 0.1 sec, σ = 3.4 sec) and path-stretch (μ = 1.0 sec, σ = 6.7 sec) runs.CAS deceleration was quantified separately from speed conformance for the 2010 Global 5000 runs but not for the 1994 results.Speed conformance and CAS deceleration can be combined using variance and covariance to derive a standard deviation of 6.1 seconds for direct cases and 3.1 seconds for path-stretch cases.Both are larger than the 1994 airspeed conformance standard deviation of about 2 seconds.The different airspeed conformance and deceleration errors between 1994 and 2010 are potentially due to different aircraft and different flight crews.The different errors due to airspeed conformance could also be attributed to VNAV being guidance-only and not coupled to the autopilot or autothrottle.The 1994 test non-FMS runs exhibited a 4-second standard deviation of airspeed conformance error, which is higher than the approximately 2-second standard deviation exhibited by the test aircraft that used the FMS with LNAV and VNAV capabilities.For this reason, the 2010 airspeed conformance standard deviation of 3.4 seconds is consistent with expectations that it would fall between the standard deviation for non-FMS runs and runs with LNAV and VNAV.The different errors due to deceleration, in addition to different aircraft types and flight crew, could be caused by the procedure to meet the meter-fix crossing speed.In 1994, the aircraft CAS was reduced by maintaining idle thrust at bottom of descent, pitching the aircraft to a level segment, and then using the level segment to reduce speed to meet the meter-fix crossing speed.In 2010, the descent CAS was diminished by reducing throttle to at or near idle, using pitch to maintain the vertical profile, and using speed brakes as needed to meet the meter-fix crossing speed restriction.It is easier to predict a reduction in CAS during a level segment than in descent, because the level segment deceleration procedure is more standardized.The target Mach error source has roughly the same cause as the initial ground speed used in the error source analysis of the 1994 field trial.However, the 2010 Global 5000 runs had much higher errors attributed to the target Mach for direct (μ = -1.1 sec, σ = 5.7 sec) and path-stretch (μ = -7.5 sec, σ = 15.9 sec) runs as compared to the error source analysis of initial ground speed (μ = -1.6 sec, σ = 1.5 sec) from the 1994 trial.The higher target Mach error in 2010 is attributed in large part to the aircraft turning onto the arrival route closer (about 90 to 120 nmi from meter fix) to the meter fix than in 1994 (about 130 nmi from meter fix).This turn causes a transient error in the radar track ground speed estimate, often lower than the aircraft's actual ground speed, at the initial condition, which occurs after the turn has completed.A lower ground speed, from which Mach is determined by subtracting out winds and converting TAS to Mach using atmospheric conditions, results in a lower Mach than was recorded on the aircraft.The turn overshoot (μ = 0.3 sec, σ = 0.7 sec) is roughly equivalent to the path-distance (μ = -5.2sec, σ = 5.0 sec) error source.However, in the 2010 Global 5000 path-stretch runs, the aircraft consistently undershot the turn, causing the aircraft to arrive earlier than predicted at the meter fix and resulting in a larger standard deviation than was observed in 1994.Potential reasons for the difference are as follows.The turn radius of an aircraft is defined by ground speed and bank angle.A higher ground speed requires a longer turn radius at the same bank angle.The flown ground speed is higher than predicted (discussed in the previous paragraph), which is consistent with a larger flown turn radius as compared to the CTAS-predicted turn radius.Another possibility is that the bank angle used by CTAS in 1994 was more appropriate for a Boeing 737 than the bank angle used by CTAS in 2010 for a Global 5000 aircraft.The default bank angle of 20.8 degrees used in CTAS according to Equation (1) in Section 3 to model the Global 5000 aircraft could have been an underestimate, because a larger bank angle would result in a shorter turn radius that would more closely match the Global 5000 turns.Winds aloft prediction had a larger effect on the standard deviation of meter-fix arrival time error in 1994 (μ = -5 sec, σ = 11 sec) than in 2010 for both the direct (μ = -4.0sec, σ = 3.4 sec) and pathstretch (μ = -3.1 sec, σ = 4.5 sec) cases.The predicted wind speed error often exceeded 20 knots, and exceeded 60 knots in some cases, in 1994.By comparison, only 4 of the 44 runs had wind speed errors that exceeded 15 knots, and none of the runs experienced a wind speed error of more than 20 knots at any location along the trajectory.These lower wind speed errors were a result of better winds-aloft predictions in 2010, which are more appropriate for trajectory prediction than the wind models used in 1994.For example, CTAS wind updates in 2010 occurred at a 1-hour interval, which is more frequent than the 3-hour interval used in 1994.Besides the reduction of the RUC wind forecast interval from 3 hours (available in 1994) to 1 hour (available in 2010), improvements in the state of the art have reduced wind forecast errors substantially. 20
Comparison to 2009 3D PAM Flight Trial Using Revenue FlightsA 3D PAM field trial was conducted at Denver in September 2009 using Boeing 737, Boeing 757, and Airbus 319/320 aircraft during revenue flights. 3Analysis was performed on 270 flight-issued cruise and descent speeds that were uninterrupted during descent.The top-of-descent (TOD) error and meter-fix arrival-time error were calculated differently for the 2009 flight trial than for the 2010 flight trial, however an approximate comparison is presented next.The direct runs were used for comparison because they were less influenced by the turn near the initial condition.This turn would generally not exist in the revenue flights.The TOD prediction error in 2009 was reported as a mean absolute value of 5.4 nmi; 47 percent of the flights had errors of less than 5 nmi.The TOD prediction error in 2010 was an order of magnitude smaller at 0.7-nmi mean absolute value; 100 percent of the runs had errors of less than 5 nmi.The arrival-time error in 2009 was reported as 11.5 seconds mean absolute value; 80 percent of the flights had errors of less than 20 seconds.The error in 2010 was 15.6 seconds mean absolute value; 67 percent of the runs had errors of less than 20 seconds.However, if the deceleration error source was removed, as would be expected if the Global 5000 decelerated in a more predictable level segment, the error would be reduced to 11.2 seconds mean absolute value with 83 percent of the runs having an arrivaltime error less than 20 seconds.The Global 5000 results in 2010 are similar to the Boeing and Airbus results of 2009 in the absence of a Global 5000 deceleration prediction error.To definitively confirm this result, the Global 5000 runs would need to be repeated using the different deceleration procedure.
Error MitigationSeveral of the error sources identified in 2010 lend themselves to significant reduction with modest to no changes to ATC automation and/or procedures.The tracker jump error source may require no additional mitigation strategy because the FAA En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) was deployed after the 2010 flight trial.ERAM replaces the En Route Host tracker with a more modern algorithm that is expected to greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the radar track jumps.The CAS deceleration error source could be reduced by using a level segment CAS deceleration similar to the procedure used by large jets.During a level segment CAS deceleration, the aircraft levels at the meter-fix crossing altitude prior to the fix and maintains the altitude at idle thrust to reduce CAS.This level segment CAS deceleration is expected to be more predictable than CAS deceleration during descent.There are multiple changes that could reduce the magnitude of the target Mach error source.The ERAM radar tracker is expected to more accurately estimate ground speed during turns and, therefore, reduce the magnitude of the target Mach error source.The impact of the turn could also be mitigated by limiting trajectory prediction updates to more steady state conditions, which is more closely aligned with 3D PAM validation tests.Another target Mach mitigation strategy could be to use both the issued cruise airspeed and descent speed for trajectory predictions.This flight trial was based on passively estimating airspeed at the initial condition using radar track ground speed, which is converted to airspeed by considering winds and atmosphere.This more closely represents the conditions of an en route conflict probe.However, it would be more consistent with existing 3D PAM validation testing to have ATC issue cruise airspeed and use the airspeed for the trajectory prediction.The path distance error source is influenced by the turn modeling in CTAS.Path distance errors could be reduced by calibrating an aircraft model that is used in CTAS to better predict aircraft behavior during turns.
ConclusionsThis paper estimated the trajectory prediction accuracy and error sources of 3D PAM descents based on a field trial at Denver International Airport using the Global 5000 aircraft.The predicted trajectory used the CTAS trajectory synthesizer and data known on the ground prior to the aircraft descending approximately 60 to 120 nmi from the meter fix.The flown trajectory and other data, including atmospheric and wind conditions, were obtained from an onboard air data computer.The Global 5000 aircraft arrived to the meter fix about 15 and 27 seconds earlier than predicted on average for direct and path-stretch runs, respectively.About a 10-second (direct) and 26-second (path-stretch) standard deviation of the error associated with the early arrival of the Global 5000 aircraft was observed.Seven error sources were identified including (a) tracker jumps, (b) wind, (c) deceleration to meter-fix crossing speed, (d) speed conformance during descent, (e) targeted Mach prior to descent, (f) atmosphere and altitude, and (g) path distance.Targeted Mach had the largest effect on arrival-time error variance, representing about 31 percent (direct) and 60 percent (path stretch) of the total arrival-time error variance.The target Mach error was due to radar track ground speed errors associated with maneuvers to reposition the aircraft to initiate each run.Speed conformance-representing 14 percent (direct) and 17 percent (path stretch)-as well as CAS deceleration-representing 24 percent (direct) and -18 percent (path stretch)-are the next highest components of total variance.A negative value for CAS deceleration during path-stretch runs indicates that CAS deceleration compensates for other error sources.Four of the error sources-tracker jumps, CAS deceleration, target Mach, and path distance-lend themselves to significant reduction with modest to no changes to ATC automation and/or procedures.These changes could significantly reduce trajectory prediction error.The TOD prediction error in 2010 was an order of magnitude smaller than in 2009.While the mean arrival-time error was about 30 percent higher in 2010 compared to 2009, if the deceleration error source was removed as it would be if the Global 5000 decelerated in a level segment, then the results would be on par.When comparing the 2010 results to the 1994 results, the largest difference not due to experimental design and artifact was the impact of the wind-prediction error.The reduction from 11-second standard deviation in 1994 to a less than 5-second standard deviation in 2010 was, in large part, due to better winds-aloft prediction.

Appendix A: Run-by-Run Magnitude of Tracker Jump Error SourceThis appendix provides a summary of the magnitude of errors in the en route radar segment, as well as the magnitude of the transition from en route to terminal radar (see Table 7).The left four columns provide the run number, negative jump error magnitude, positive jump error magnitude, and magnitude of the error when transitioning from the en route radar to the terminal radar for the non-pathstretch runs.The error magnitude is used in Equation (2) described in Section 6.1 to quantify the magnitude of the track jump error source.The right four columns show the same information including path-stretch runs shown as the last nine rows after the shaded row.Tracker jump errors are cumulative so that the error applies at the radar track where the jump occurs and all subsequent tracks.The terminal radar track is considered to be in error, even though it may be more accurate than the en route radar, in this analysis when it does not match the en route radar at the transition because the en route controller only has access to the en route radar and controls the aircraft based on the radar tracks returned from the en route radar.If possible, future analysis of this type should exclusively use en route radar tracks.
Appendix B: Run-by-Run Ranked Effect of Error SourcesThis appendix provides a ranking of the impact of each error source on (1) the maximum time error along the trajectory, and (2) the time error at the meter fix.The top-ranked run is the run that has the largest absolute value impact from a specific error source.See Tables 8 through 23.

Appendix C: Run-by-Run Results for Direct RunsThis appendix includes plots for direct runs without path-stretch clearances.A description of the plots as they relate to the error sources is presented first, followed by the plots for each run.
C.1. Incremental Error Source Effect on Time ErrorThe first plot presented for each run (e.g., Fig. 35) shows the incremental effect that removing each error source has on the flown minus predicted time error.The data series labeled "Uncorrected" represents the flown minus predicted time without removing any error sources.The data series labeled "(A) Tracker" is the time error after the tracker jump error source has been removed.Also removing the wind error source results in the data series labeled "(A)+(B) Wind."This incremental removal of error sources continues until all identified error sources have been removed in the data series labeled "(A)+…+(G) Dist."
C.1.A. Tracker JumpsThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 36) in the tracker jumps error source subsection isolates the effect of the tracker jump error source on the time error for each run similar to the previous plot.This plot is included because the previous data plot contains seven data series, and distinguishing between them may be difficult.The second plot (e.g., Fig. 37) shows the magnitude of the tracker jump error source.Subtracting the data series in this plot from the "Uncorrected" data series in the previous plot results in the "(A) Tracker" data series.
C.1.B. WindThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 38) in the wind error source subsection isolates the effect of the wind error source on the time error for each run.The second plot (e.g., Fig. 39) in the wind error source subsection shows the predicted and flown wind effect on ground speed.The y-axis is the magnitude when subtracting the TAS vector from the ground speed vector.Subtracting the "ADC Flown Wind Speed" data series from the "CTAS Predicted Wind Speed" in this plot results in the change in ground speed after removing this error source.This change in ground speed is shown as the "(B) Wind" data series in the next plot (e.g., Fig. 40).This plot, which does not incrementally add the error source effects, shows the change in predicted ground speed by removing the five error sources listed.Two error sources, tracker jumps and path distance, are not converted to a ground speed effect.
C.1.C. CAS DecelerationThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 41) in the CAS deceleration error source subsection isolates the effect of the CAS deceleration error source on the time error for each run.The second plot (e.g., Fig. 42) in the CAS deceleration error source subsection shows the flown and predicted CAS.The CAS value that is being targeted is shown in this plot with circle markers.The difference between flown and predicted CAS for this error source is only applied after the aircraft is predicted to start decelerating to the meter-fix crossing speed restriction.This occurs at approximately 60 nmi along the predicted path in Fig. 42.The difference between flown and predicted CAS during the constant CAS segment, which is the horizontal segment at 300 knots CAS, is applied during the quantification of the speed conformance error source.The difference between flown and predicted CAS before the constant CAS segment was not used in this analysis.The third plot (e.g., Fig. 43) in the CAS deceleration error source subsection shows the flown and predicted TAS/CAS ratio that was used to convert flown CAS to TAS as described in Subsection 6.3 of Section 6.The fourth plot (e.g., Fig. 44) in the CAS deceleration error source subsection shows the flown and predicted TAS.This plot was not used in the error source analysis but is included for completeness.The fifth plot (e.g., Fig. 45) in the CAS deceleration error source subsection shows deviation from flown TAS if a TAS was derived from CAS and Mach using atmospheric temperature and pressure according to Equations (3) to (7) in Section 6.1.
C.1.D. Speed ConformanceThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 46) in the speed conformance error source subsection isolates the effect of the speed conformance error source on the time error for each run.The location where the speed conformance error source applies can be determined by locating the constant CAS segment in the flown vs. predicted CAS plot described earlier (e.g., Fig. 42).Throttle may have been adjusted to maintain constant CAS during this segment.Though not used in quantifying this error source, the engine N1, N2 (e.g., Fig. 47) and EPR (e.g., Fig. 48) are included to show if thrust may have been changed during descent.
C.1.E. Target MachThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 49) in the target Mach error source subsection isolates the effect of the target Mach error source on the time error for each run.The second plot (e.g., Fig. 50) in the target Mach error source subsection shows the flown and predicted Mach.The difference between the flown and predicted Mach at the initial condition at zero along the x-axis is of interest because predicted Mach is not changed during the constant Mach segment; the difference is considered along the constant Mach segment that occurs from zero to about 52 nmi along the x-axis in Figure 50.The third plot (e.g., Fig. 51) in the target Mach error source subsection shows the flown and predicted TAS/Mach ratio that was used to convert flown Mach to TAS as described in Subsection 6.5 of Section 6.
C.1.F. Atmosphere/AltitudeThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 52) in the atmosphere/altitude error source subsection isolates the effect of the atmosphere/altitude error source on the time error for each run.The second plot (e.g., Fig. 53) in the atmosphere/altitude error source subsection shows the flown (radar and aircraft ADC) and predicted (CTAS) vertical profile.The radar altitude minus the CTAS predicted altitude is shown in the next plot (e.g., Fig. 54).The fourth (e.g., Fig. 55), fifth (e.g., Fig. 56) and sixth (e.g., Fig. 57) plots in the atmosphere/ altitude error source subsection compare flown (ADC) and predicted (CTAS) static air temperature, impact pressure, and static pressure, respectively.
C.1.G. Path DistanceThe first plot (e.g., Fig. 58) in the path distance error source subsection isolates the effect of the path distance error source on the time error for each run.The second plot (e.g., Fig. 59) in the path distance error source subsection shows the flown minus predicted path length.This is followed by a ground track profile (e.g., Fig. 60) and cross-track error (e.g., Fig. 61).
Appendix E: Mean and Standard Deviation of Error Source Effect at Five Locations From Top of Descent to Meter FixThe mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the effect of the seven error sources at six locations between top of descent and the meter fix inclusive are shown in Table 24 for both direct runs (labeled as the "D" rows) and path-stretch runs (label as the "PS" rows).
