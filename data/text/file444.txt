Direct-To ToolThe CTAS route analysis and trajectory synthesis software computes 4-dimensional (x,y position, altitude, time) trajectory predictions in real-time for all aircraft, based on radar track and flight plan data from the Center Host computer, atmospheric data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) forecast model, and aircraft performance models.All trajectory predictions are updated in response to each new radar track (every 12 sec), flight plan updates (when received), and atmospheric data updates (hourly).All aircraft trajectories are automatically analyzed for traffic conflicts and for time-saving direct routing opportunities.Updates are posted to the Direct-To user interface every 6 seconds.The Direct-To user interface, including conflict probe and route advisory information and the trial planning functions, have been implemented as an integral part of a sector controller's traffic display.The user interface, shown in Fig. 1, includes aircraft targets, flight data blocks, sector boundaries and other features typically shown on a controller's traffic display.The Direct-To List (lower right) shows aircraft whose flight time would be decreased by 1 minute or more by flying direct to a downstream fix on their route of flight [3].The Conflict List (upper left) shows traffic conflicts predicted to occur within the next 20 minutes [1,2,4].Both lists can be hidden and may be placed anywhere on the traffic display by a mouse click-and-drag action.Route advisory and conflict information are also displayed in the Flight Data Block.Figure 2 shows an example of a Flight Data Block with Direct-To route advisory and conflict probe information in the 4 th line (the aircraft radar target and radar track histories are also shown).In this example, AAL2016 has a conflict with BTA3822 predicted along its flight plan route and a conflict-free direct route opportunity to NEPTA.A mouse click on the conflict field (e.g.BTA3822 in Fig. 2) toggles a graphic display of the conflict information for AAL2016 and BTA3822.The conflict graphics, shown in Fig. 3, display the trajectories of both aircraft from current position to their first loss of separation point and any pertinent top-of-climb or topof-descent points for transitioning aircraft.The conflict information display may also be toggled by clicking the associated entry in the Conflict List.
Fig. 3. Conflict information graphics.A route trial plan is activated by clicking either the destination airport field in the Flight Data Block (e.g.FLL in Fig. 2), the direct route advisory in the Flight Data Block (e.g.NEPTA OK in Fig. 2), or the direct route advisory in the D2 List.A mouse click on the destination airport field activates a trial plan direct to the next fix along the route; the controller then selects the desired direct route fix by a mouse click in the Trial Planner's fix menu (see Fig. 4).The resulting trial plan is direct to the selected fix with the rest of the route unchanged.A mouse click on either the D2 advisory in the Flight Data Block or the corresponding entry in the D2 List activates a trial plan direct to the advised D2 fix with the rest of the route unchanged.The only difference between clicking the route advisory (NEPTA) and clicking the destination airport field (FLL) is the default fix upon Trial Planner activation.Figure 4 shows a portion of the user interface with an active route trial plan.As shown in the figure, the fix menu includes all fixes along the route of flight.The time savings (or deficit) associated with a direct route to each fix is also shown in the fix menu.Once the Trial Planner is activated, the controller may click a different fix from the fix menu at any time and the trial plan status information is updated every 1 second.Trial plan status information includes the graphic display, flying time savings (or deficit), traffic conflicts, preferential routing, and wind-corrected magnetic heading to the Direct-To fix.Special Use Airspace probing is currently in the Direct-To software, but was not tested during the field test.An auxiliary waypoint function [1,2,7] allows controllers to trial plan a vector heading to an auxiliary waypoint followed by a direct route to the selected Direct-To fix.An auxiliary waypoint is added to a trial plan by clicking anywhere along the trial plan route and then dragging the auxiliary waypoint to the desired position.Direct-To computes and displays the windcorrected magnetic heading to the auxiliary waypoint.The auxiliary waypoint is automatically accounted for when the trial plan status information is updated, and is automatically included in the flight plan amendment message described in the next section.
Host Flight Plan Amendment FunctionA key feature that was added to the Direct-To Tool for the field test is the ability to send a Host flight plan amendment by clicking the "Accept" button on the Trial Planner panel (Fig. 4).A Direct-To route amendment simply requires 2-3 mouse clicks -one to activate the trial plan, one to possibly modify the Direct-To fix or add an auxiliary waypoint, and one to send a flight plan amendment!The current system requires anywhere from 8-25 keyboard entries and requires the controller to look away from the traffic display.Using Direct-To, a controller may input a flight plan amendment while keeping their attention focused on the traffic display.CTAS automatically forms a flight plan amendment message whenever the Trial Planner is activated.The amendment message immediately updates to reflect the user's manipulation of the trial plan parameters (e.g., changing the direct-to fix, adding or moving an auxiliary waypoint, etc.) and the current position of the aircraft.In support of the Direct-To flight plan amendment function, the FAA modified a segment of Host software called the "320 Patch."Prior to the Direct-To modifications, the 320 Patch was configurable for 2way communication between CTAS and Host for TMA meter messages, or between the User Request Evaluation Tool (URET) and Host for flight plan amendments.Six lines of code were modified so that the patch could support Direct-To flight plan amendments and TMA meter messages simultaneously.Simultaneous support of TMA meter messages and Direct-To flight plan amendments was a key program objective since Direct-To was to be tested by connecting the Direct-To software module to the daily use CTAS/TMA system at Fort Worth Center.
Preferential Routing AnalysisDuring simulation testing of Direct-To with the Host, it was noted that several Direct-To flight plan amendments for aircraft landing at major Houston Center airports (IAH, HOU, SAT, AUS) were automatically overridden by Host Preferential Route Processing [8].In order to help organize traffic flow into busy airports, the Host automatically applies Air Traffic Control (ATC) preferred routes for some arrival aircraft.However, traffic conditions do not always require that aircraft fly the entire preferential route.Operationally, controllers decide when to allow a shortcut of a preferential route.But, if they do, controllers don't always send a corresponding flight plan amendment because they know that Host preferential routing logic will override the amendment.It was determined that the Direct-To Tool should indicate to the controller when a Direct-To amendment might be over-ridden.The method used to determine when a Direct-To flight plan amendment will be over-ridden is based on knowledge of the Host preferential routing logic.The Host uses so-called "transition lines" and "transition fixes" to determine when to apply a reroute."A-lines" are the subset of transition lines that help determine rerouting for arrivals and A-lines are generally associated with one or more airports.Usually the Host automatically reroutes an aircraft onto an ATC preferred arrival route if its current flight plan intersects an A-line for its arrival airport.The one exception is: if the flight plan is direct to a transition fix ("T-fix") that lies on the preferential arrival route, then the Host will not override the flight plan amendment.This logic was implemented in the Direct-To Tool and the necessary adaptation data were added to the 56-day CTAS adaptation updates.A plus sign (+) next to the Direct-To fix in the Direct-To List indicates when the flight plan amendment would trigger a Host reroute.When trial planning an aircraft that could be affected by preferential routing, a "t" appears next to any T-fix in the Trial Planner's fix menu.This allows the controller to see which Direct-To amendments would not trigger a Host reroute.The Trial Planner panel and the graphic display also include clear indications (or warnings) when input of the trial plan would trigger a Host reroute.As the controller manipulates an active trial plan, preferential routing status is updated every 1 second with other Trial Planner information.
Software and Hardware ArchitectureAll CTAS tools utilize common software for input data processing and 4D trajectory synthesis.Consequently, the Direct-To tool can be implemented by connecting a single additional software module to an existing CTAS Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) system.This software architecture approach should enable the FAA to leverage the TMA investment made under Free Flight Phase 1 to significantly reduce Direct-To deployment and life-cycle costs.CTAS TMA has been in operational daily use at Fort Worth Center since October 1996.An important objective of this field test was to demonstrate simultaneous use of TMA and Direct-To in an operational environment.In preparation for the field test, the Direct-To software module (Profile Selector Center or PFS_C) was merged into the operational CTAS TMA software and released for use at Fort Worth Center.Direct-To functionality testing was incorporated into NASA release software test procedures and FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) test procedures that demonstrate noninterference with the Host.Direct-To functionality is now part of every CTAS release.Figure 5 illustrates the combined TMA/D2 system used for this field test.The above-mentioned PFS_C software module is the computational engine for Direct-To.The Direct-To user interface is intended to be implemented directly on the Display System Replacement (DSR) R-side display.However, for the prototype system used in this field test, the D2 user interface has been implemented in the CTAS Planview Graphical User Interface (PGUI) module (i.e. the CTAS traffic display).As shown in Fig. 5, a CTAS PGUI module configured for Direct-To was deployed (on an auxiliary flat-panel displays) at each of the 3 test sectors.

Field Test OperationsThe operational field test evaluation of the Direct-To Tool was conducted at the FAA Fort Worth Center from May 21 -June 14, 2001.The objectives of the field test were: 1) evaluate Direct-To under operational conditions, 2) validate expected benefits to controllers and airspace users, 3) validate the integrated CTAS TMA/Direct-To/Host system, 4) identify modifications, improvements, and operational issues, and 5) gather data to refine the concept of use for D2 on the Display System Replacement (DSR).Three high altitude sectors were selected for the test: Ardmore High (Sector 48), Texarkana High (Sector 90), and Paxto (Sector 86).Sector selection was based on the potential for direct route flying time savings, the variety of direct routings (e.g., departures, over-flights, aircraft on preferential routes), and traffic complexity.The goal was to test the tool under a variety of traffic conditions and a high level of traffic complexity.The Paxto sector, with its large number of transitioning and over-flight traffic, is considered to be one of the most complex sectors in Fort Worth Center.The Direct-To user interface was displayed on 15 inch flat panel auxiliary display monitors installed at the D-Side position of each test sector.Figure 6 shows the flat panel installation at Ardmore High.Direct-To functionality is intended for the R-Side DSR display.However, for this prototype proof-of-concept field test, the only location deemed suitable for the auxiliary displays was the D-Side DSR console.The flat panel monitors were installed on articulating arms so the controllers could easily adjust the orientation of the monitor during test operations and stow the monitor during non-test periods.Both R-Side and D-Side positions of each sector were staffed with D2-trained controllers during all field test operations.Just prior to the start of each run, the D2 controllers checked onto the R-Side and D-Side positions of each sector.The tool was tested at all 3 sectors simultaneously.A NASA observer at each test sector recorded controller comments and sector activity and noted any relevant problems or operational issues.The observer wore a head set to monitor controller/pilot radio communication.Each test period was preceded by a 15 minute briefing and followed by a 1 hour debriefing.Data recorded during the field test included radar track and flight plan data from the Center Host computer, RUC atmospheric data, all conflict predictions and Direct-To route advisories that were posted to the user interface during test runs, relevant parameters associated with every activation of the Trial Planner (e.g., direct-to fix, flight plan route and conflict status, direct-to route and conflict status, etc,), Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) radar track and flight plan data (for analysis of aircraft track position after departing Fort Worth Center airspace), and Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) severe weather data.Baseline ETMS track and flight plan data were obtained from archive for the 1 month period preceding the field test to be used for comparison of field test vs. baseline operations.Human factors workload and usability data were also collected during the field test.These data include workload questionnaires, recorded debrief interview sessions, and usability and interface evaluation questionnaires.
Test Data AnalysisThis section covers controller feedback from questionnaires and debrief sessions, controllers' use of the Trial Planner and the Direct-To route advisories, flying time savings during periods of severe weather, and an analysis of net flying time savings while controllers were using Direct-To compared to baseline periods without Direct-To.
Controller FeedbackA modified NASA Task Load Index (TLX) questionnaire was used to measure the controller workload associated with the Direct-To Tool [9,10].Figure 7 shows the mean and standard deviation (error bars) of the TLX workload questionnaire responses.Both the R-Side and D-Side test controllers completed the questionnaire after each test run.A total of 187 samples were collected.On a scale of 1-10 (low-high), the responses for Tool Support and Satisfaction vs. Frustration with the tool are rated 7 or better, indicating D2 provided strong support with high satisfaction levels.The responses for Overall Effort and Time Pressure while using the tool are rated 4 or below, indicating the tool required low overall effort with little added time pressure.Responses for Mental Demand stayed mid-range showing that D2 provided good support with a minimal amount of effort required.In Fig. 7, the Overall Effort, Time Pressure, and Mental Demand are that which controllers perceived while performing their normal duties while using the Direct-To Tool.A Usability and Interface Evaluation Questionnaire was given at the conclusion of the test to identify any design-related problems or issues and to allow the controllers to provide written feedback about the operational suitability of the Direct-To Tool.The questions were divided into various aspects of the tool; Direct-To List, Direct-To Graphics, Interactive Flight Data Blocks, Trial Planner Functionality.Most questions called for a numeric rating; some asked for a written response to specific questions.Figure 8 shows the mean and standard deviation (error bars) of the numeric controller responses.The results show that on a scale of 1-5 (bad to good) controller feedback on all tool functionality and ease of use was 4 or better.This further validates the basic tool design and its usefulness to controllers.Furthermore, the human factors workload data and usability data presented in Figs.7 and8 demonstrate that controller benefits were obtained by using the Direct-To Tool with little impact to reported controller workload.Both written and verbal debrief comments, as well analysis of data from a relative task workload questionnaire [11], help support these conclusions.Also, the test controllers reported extremely high levels of acceptance and pertinent application of Direct-To with their everyday operations.One controller said, "Controllers are very resistant to change and new ideas.I was really surprised at how all nine of us, real quick, after only a couple of days on the floor said this (Direct-To) is workable.Give us more!" Another said, "We see a lot of potential benefit from this tool.We've become more efficient, most definitely."Another said, "My perception of how busy I was went way up when the D2 Tool was turned off."The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has no position on Direct-To as of now, but will be looking at it from the national level soon.
Trial Planner ActivityIt was clear during the field test that controllers used the Direct-To Tool to investigate direct routes for those aircraft with D2 route advisories, and to evaluate routes for many other aircraft that did not have D2 advisories.Direct-To list ease of use

Overall Trial Planner activity.Trial plans were rejected perhaps because existing conflicts were not resolved or new ones were created.However, after the first week of testing only 11% of rejected trial plans had unresolved conflicts.This finding supports the notion that the tool was often used to simply enhance situational awareness.It should also be noted that 10.5% (126 out of 1198) of Direct-To flight plan amendments included auxiliary waypoints.Controller feedback on the auxiliary waypoint function was very positive.
Direct-To Route Advisory ActivityDuring the test periods for the participating sectors, there were a total of 1117 aircraft that qualified for Direct-To route advisories (time saving ≥ 1 min).Controllers selected 602 of those aircraft for trial planning.Figure 10 shows the Direct-To advisory activity.An average of about 31% of all trial plans had D2 route advisories.It is interesting to note that after the first week, controllers accepted 50% of trial plans for aircraft that had Direct-To advisories, while accepting only 35% of trial plans for aircraft without D2 advisories.As discussed earlier, Direct-To route advisories are displayed in the D2 List and in the Flight Data Block.A controller may activate a trial plan for a route advisory by clicking either the D2 List or the Flight Data Block.It was observed that the first week most controllers preferred to operate without the Direct-To list displayed.The team commented that Direct-To route advisories in the Flight Data Block were adequate.Furthermore, since advisories were available in the Flight Data Block, the list could be hidden to reduce clutter on the traffic display.Figure 11 shows that, after the first week, only about 8% of trial plans were initiated from the Direct-To List.This clearly demonstrates controller preference for initiating a trial plan from the Flight Data Block and correlates with controller comments presented in the previous section.12 clearly shows the controller using the tool while the sector was in Monitor Alert status.This suggests that the benefit-to-workload ratio of the Direct-To Tool, even in this experimental configuration (auxiliary displays), is high enough for controllers to use the tool during heavy traffic periods.In order to characterize controllers' use of the Direct-To tool over all field test runs, all data were divided into successive 10 minute intervals.Fig. 13 shows a plot of the total number of Trial Planner actions vs. the average number of aircraft in the sector for every 10 minute interval in the field test.While the tool was operated in three sectors simultaneously, the data for each sector is a unique 10 minute interval.The bolded points are those for which the sector was in Monitor Alert status at some time during the 10 minute interval.The data show that Trial Planner usage varied widely across different traffic loads.In fact, the controllers activated the Trial Planner up to 13 times in intervals when the sector was in Monitor Alert status.These data clearly document controllers' use of the Trial Planner during a wide variety of traffic levels including Monitor Alert periods.Furthermore, the data suggest that the added workload was so low that controllers could use the tool even during the busiest periods.The results show that less than 3% (13 out of 405) of aircraft possibly deviated off of the Direct-To route for severe weather avoidance and those deviations were relatively small.Nevertheless, the results illustrate the potential benefit of integrating severe weather data with the Direct-To Tool.Route advisories could be probed for severe weather penetration before posting to the display, and the Trial Planner could automatically probe for severe weather.A small percentage of aircraft could encounter operational problems if they reach their destination on the order of 10 minutes early (too much fuel to land, no arrival gate, etc.).It is important to note, however, that flying time savings can usually be traded for fuel savings by reducing cruise speed.
Net Direct-To Flying Time SavingsOne objective of the post test analysis is to compare direct route savings achieved during the field test, when controllers were using the Direct-To Tool, with baseline savings during periods when the tool was not in use.The goal is to estimate the net savings achieved with Direct-To in operation.Figure 15 illustrates the time savings analysis.Consider the notional route between  Figure 18 shows similar results for a flight (DAL204) through Sector 90 with direct routes to PXV.The flight path distance between the reference fixes for each flight was calculated using the radar track data.Table 1 shows the average flight path distance for flights that received D2 amendments during the field  Referring to Fig. 15, the Net D2 Savings expressed as a percentage of Potential Savings is the portion of Potential Savings that was achieved while controllers were using Direct-To under operational conditions.This percentage is defined as S, the Normalized Net D2 Savings, where S is expressed as: S = (TB -TFT)/(TB -TM).The normalized savings in Table 3 may be used to estimate the actual savings that could be achieved if Direct-To were in operation throughout Fort Worth Center.Through laboratory analysis of Fort Worth Center traffic, the Potential Savings at Fort Worth Center has been estimated at 1,800 flying minutes per day or about $18,000,000 per year [3].It is important to note that these savings estimates from Reference [3] are corrected for direct routes issued by controllers (without D2) and are therefore consistent with the definition of Potential Savings illustrated in Fig. 15.Based on the D2 savings model described above, the estimated actual savings is the Potential Savings scaled by the Normalized Net D2 Savings.However, certain factors must be considered when using field test data (Table 3) to scale the laboratory-derived savings estimates [3].It is assumed that the normalized savings in Table 3
Additional ObservationsControllers developed confidence in the Direct-To trajectory analysis, particularly the conflict probe information and the top-of-climb predictions.An aircraft's top-of-climb is an important consideration when controllers evaluate conflicts and routing options in transition airspace.For any conflict probe tool to be effective it is important that controllers have confidence in the trajectory predictions.On at least occasion during the field test a pilot asked one of the D2 controllers for a direct route.Upon trial planning the direct route, the controller noted the direct route would have resulted in increased flying time due to wind effects.When the controller relayed that information to the pilot, the pilot retracted the request.This case highlights the importance of the flying time analysis being available whenever the controller activates the Trial Planner.
ConclusionsThe field test thoroughly exercised Direct-To functionality under operational conditions.Controllers activated 3204 trial plans and sent 1198 Direct-To flight plan amendments to the Host during 136 sector-hours of operational testing.Controller acceptance of the Direct-To Tool was very high.Controller commentary and written feedback suggest that significant controller benefit could be achieved if Direct-To functionality were integrated with the R-Side traffic situation display.The results document consistent levels of Direct-To usage during all traffic conditions and that added workload associated with Direct-To is low enabling controllers to use the tool even during busy traffic periods.The Direct-To Tool provides a means of dynamically identifying and updating obsolete weather avoidance routes.An average savings of 9.4 minutes per flight was realized for 27 aircraft that were on obsolete weather avoidance routes prior to receiving a Direct-To flight plan amendment.A methodology was presented to estimate the net flying time savings achieved while controllers were using Direct-To compared to baseline (no-tool) operations.The test data show an average net savings of about 1 minute per flight.The test data suggest that about 50% of laboratoryderived estimates of flying time savings could beFig. 2 .2Fig. 2.

Controllers used Direct-To to help evaluate and resolve conflicts, to evaluate and execute routing options, and to send flight plan amendments to the Host.Tool Usability and Interface Evaluation Means12345During the 31 test periods over four weeks, controllers in the Ardmore, Texarkana, and Paxto sectors used Direct-To to create a total of 3204 trial plans for 1937 different aircraft.Of the trial plans, 1198 were

A nominalspeed of Mach 0.8 at FL330 (465 knots ground speed)was used to calculate the time savings. The actualflying times could not be used for the comparisonbecause of wind variation across the different sampledays. The average flying time difference is the Net D2Time Savings (see Fig. 15).

During the first week of testing, Fort Worth Center operations received a call from Memphis Center requesting that certain direct routes (e.g.direct EOS) from Ardmore to fixes in Kansas City Center not be issued.The request was certainly honored.The routing in question would route aircraft into Memphis Center airspace for a very short period of time (about 5 min) before entering Kansas City Center.(InFig.14, the Direct-To route from Ardmore passes just West of the small segment of Memphis Center airspace at the point where the route exits Fort Worth Center.)The routing is undesirable since Memphis Center must take control of the aircraft and then almost immediately transfer control to Kansas City Center.Also during the first week of testing, some East-North-East-bound Direct-To routes issued in Ardmore routed aircraft through a Fort Worth Center sector (Decod, Sector 42) which primarily handles DFW arrival traffic.The Decod controllers asked that the Direct-To controllers not send aircraft on direct routes through the Decod sector.This request was also honored.The Decod controllers were concerned that a Direct-To aircraft might conflict with West-bound DFW arrivals that were not under Fort Worth Center radar coverage at the time the Direct-To route was issued.It should be clear however, that radar coverage extends well beyond the Center boundary (about 45 miles East into Memphis Center airspace in this example) and Direct-To starts computing a trajectory for conflict probing as soon as the first radar track is received.Also, this would not be an issue if CTAS were operating in the neighboring Center and data were exchanged for conflict probing.It should also be noted that Direct-To routes from Sector 90 through Sector 42 were generally not an issue.

achieved if Direct-To were in operation throughout Fort Worth Center.This equates to a savings of 900 flying minutes per day or $9,000,000 per year.Controllers developed confidence in the Direct-To trajectory analysis, particularly its conflict probe information and its top-of-climb predictions.The operation of TMA and D2 on a common CTAS system was validated under operational conditions.There was no adverse impact to TMA during 136 sector-hours of simultaneous TMA/D2 operations.
