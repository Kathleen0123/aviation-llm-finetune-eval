ALGORITHM DESCRIFFIONIn broad outline, the DA algorithm synthesizes a 4D trajectory in the following way.First, the DA predicts the arrival time of an aircraft following a defined arrival route, based on the aircraft's standard operating procedures.
DA Trajectory ModelFor each descent speed profile selected in the iteration process, the corresponding descent trajectory is computed by integrating a set of point mass equations of motion along the route of arrival.The equations are derived with respect to an Earthfixed reference frame using a rectangular coordinate system based upon a fiat-Earth approximation.The trajectory is projected onto two planes--the horizontal, which defines the horizontal path, and the vertical, which defines the altitude profile along the path.The altitude profile and horizontal path are illustrated in Figures 1 and2.This paper will focus on the hor-
The coordinatess and h are defined as distance along the path and altitude, respectively.The kinematic equations to be integrated are ds u e _-= V t cos(?a) + Uws (1)dh w =-_ = V t sin (?a) (2)where u and w are defined as the components of inertial veloc-ity

Before each simulation session the pilots were given a briefing about the DA which included the procedures for anticipating and flying turns precisely and for executing the profile descents that were to be issued by the controllers. They were also briefed ononly change to current procedures for a descent to the Drako feeder fix was that the crossing restriction at Drako was changed from "cross Drako between 17 ,17Fig. 3 Simulated arrival routes to Denver.
FiguresFigures 4-7 show the composite altitude profiles for the baseline, nominal, fast, and slow descents in calm wind conditions.Note that for the baseline runs, although all of the pilots were flying the same profile descent (Mach 0.8/280 KIAS), the range of top-of-descent points chosen by the pilots varied by as much as 25 n.mi.This is because pilots have their own simple "rules of thumb" for choosing a top-of-descent point.There are typically even greater variations in altitude profiles and arrival times for baseline descents when various wind conditions are present (2).Also note that for the slow descents, one aircraft began its descent 10 n.mi. earlier than necessary.In this descent, the pilot thought the procedure was to reduce speed

A concept for aiding air traffic controllers in efficiently spacing Izaffic and meeting scheduled arrival times at a metering fix has been developed and tested in a real-time simulation.The automation aid, referred to as the ground-based four-dimensional descent advisor (DA), is based on accurate models of aircraft performance and weather conditions.The DA generates suggested clearances, including both topof-descent-point and speed-profile data, for one or more aircraft in order to achieve specific time or distance separation objectives.The DA algorithm is used by the air traffic controller to resolve conflicts and issue advisories to arrival aircraft.A joint simulation was conducwal using a piloted simulator and an advanced-concept air traffic control simulation to study the acceptability and accuracy of the DA automation aid from both the pilot's and the air traffic controller's perspectives.This paper focuses on the results of the piloted simulation.In the piloted simulation, airline crews executed controller-issued descent advisories along standard curved-path arrival routes, and were able to achieve an arrival-time precision of +20 sec at the metering fix.An analysis of errors generated in turns resulted in further enhancements of the algorithm to improve the predictive accuracy.Evaluations by pilots indicate general support for the concept and provide specific recommendations for improvement.Operational issues concerning how the DA was used for prediction, intrail spacing, and metering in a multiaircraft environment are described in a companion paper (Tobias; see block 15).
